25|$|Many of {{the stylistic}} {{elements}} in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: himation, the contrapposto stance of the upright figures (see: 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and ushnisha apparently derived from {{the style of the}} Apollo Belvedere (330 BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism. A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the modern site of Hadda, Afghanistan. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the physical characteristics of the Buddha in the Buddhist sutras.

25|$|On 9 July 1945, Neshoba sailed in convoy to Ulithi, then to Okinawa. This trip to Okinawa did not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{peaceful}} {{conditions as}} prevailed on D-Day. Attacks by kamikazes of the Japanese air forces were {{in full swing}} at the time. During the ship's five-day stay there, she was under several air raids, which did not come near the berth, and all hands were relieved when her orders came to depart on 29 July. Once again, it was convoy duty for Neshoba, but one of a very different nature. She {{was not in a}} convoy of ships of her type, but was the mother ship to upwards of seventy craft, ranging in size from LST's down to fleet ocean tugs. Captain Mack was in command of this convoy as it set out for Saipan. During the trip, a small, but very annoying typhoon was encountered, but all ships and craft weathered the storm and sailed into Saipan harbor on 6 August.|$|E
25|$|Players {{participate}} in a shared universe, {{with the ability to}} exchange planet information with other players, though the game is also fully playable offline; this is enabled by the procedural generation system that assures players <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> planet with the same features, lifeforms, and other aspects once given the planet coordinates, requiring no further data to be stored or retrieved from game servers. Nearly all elements of the game are procedurally generated, including star systems, planets and their ecosystems, flora, fauna and their behavioural patterns, artificial structures, and alien factions and their spacecraft. The founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with No Man's Sky. The title was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from Sony Interactive Entertainment. The British band 65daysofstatic assisted in developing the game's music, with sound designer Paul Weir developing systems to procedurally generate the soundtrack.|$|E

25|$|Although Poets Follies earned Kees much notoriety, {{his other}} {{projects}} did not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kind of support. A film company {{ended in a}} lawsuit. His collaborations with Helm, Ketty Lester, and other musicians, although professionally satisfying, did not produce any hit records. A permanent home for the Poets Follies, the Showplace, a large building on Fulton Street in the Mission District, was closed in late May 1955, {{just days before the}} premiere of a serious one-act play, The Waiting Room, which Kees had written for three actress friends. During much of July, Kees spent time with a woman he had met while working at Langley Porter, a Jungian psychiatrist named Virginia Patterson. Like other relationships Kees had following his divorce, this ended abruptly. Kees, too, had been taking barbiturates for the past two years, which also had intensified his episodes of manic depression. After visiting his parents in Santa Barbara, California, one last time in early July, as well as his friend, the literary critic Hugh Kenner, Kees returned to San Francisco and had dinner with various friends, including Pauline Kael, who appeared as a guest on Kees’s film review program on KPFA-FM, Behind the Movie Camera. She noticed the disturbing changes in Kees’s demeanor. For several days in mid-July, Kees drank and commiserated with his friend and business partner, the San Francisco newspaperman and novelist Michael Grieg. He even confessed to have tried jumping over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge, but he could not physically manage it. He talked of going to Mexico as an alternative, a country that fascinated him up until then in books such as Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano. Then Kees returned to his home in the Marina District on the evening of July 17, 1955. What he did the following day is a mystery. He took a call from Michael Grieg, who told Kees of a possible job offer. Kees also telephoned a friend, the memoirist Janet Richards, seeking her company.|$|E
500|$|Watson parses {{questions}} {{into different}} keywords and sentence fragments {{in order to}} find statistically related phrases.

Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not.|$|E
500|$|Another {{distance}} measure {{commonly used}} in agglomerative clustering is {{the distance between the}} centroids of pairs of clusters, also known as the weighted group method. It can be calculated easily in constant time per distance calculation. However, it is not reducible. For instance, if the input forms the set of three points of an equilateral triangle, merging two of these points into a larger cluster causes the inter-cluster distance to decrease, a violation of reducibility. Therefore, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm will not necessarily <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> clustering as the greedy algorithm. Nevertheless, [...] writes that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm provides [...] "a good heuristic" [...] for the centroid method.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Ward's method, {{these two}} forms of {{clustering}} {{do not have a}} constant-time method for computing distances between pairs of clusters.

500|$|Using a large cast of characters—a wide {{assortment}} of personalities and cultures—allows Lat {{to comment on}} {{a wider range of}} topics than is possible {{with a small group of}} characters. [...] Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat's cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; [...] "short, compact dialogues" [...] and puns form the text while [...] "facial expressions and actions" [...] of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. [...] Muliyadi further stated that Lat's works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader would laugh at Lat's cartoon for its slapstick, while another would <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. [...] As an example, Muliyadi referred to a Keluarga Si Mamat strip published in 1972. [...] Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified physical education teachers then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. [...] Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. [...] Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher's plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government's failure to prevent the situation from happening.|$|E

As a [...] "present", de Killer stages an assassination attempt on Franziska, rendering her unable to act as prosecutor. At the last second, Edgeworth arrives and steps in to replace her. With Phoenix resorting to increasingly desperate acts to prolong the trial, Edgeworth offers to help him save Maya, explaining {{that he has been}} leading a task force to capture de Killer. Using a tape that Engarde, in truth a thoroughly guilty psychopath, had recorded as blackmail, Phoenix reveals his betrayal to de Killer. Fearing that Shelly will target him, Engarde pleads guilty and is convicted of murder. As a reward for Phoenix's help, de Killer releases Maya, who subsequently reunites with Pearl and all of their friends. Edgeworth explains that his absence was spent soul-searching for [...] "the answer" [...] as to {{what it means to be}} a prosecutor, and he and Phoenix reconcile, while Franziska pledges to renounce her profession in disgrace.
