5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It {{seems to have been a}} predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover {{some of the}} abbey's estates that had been granted to others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>but</b> had not been {{returned}} to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession {{of a number of}} these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|E

5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up {{in his living room}} and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{has used}} many {{gradations}} of lens filter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> declined {{to do so}} on Body of Lies. One obtains better finesse using the digital intermediate during post-production and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and Morocco were allowed to show through.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought that it had been a good measure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>but</b> had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E
5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused.|$|E

Susan becomes concerned when Bradley and Summer start dating, especially when they use the newspaper office for a late night hook-up. Susan checks Bradley's references and discovers that he has lied. She also learns that he was fired from his last job for dating his boss' daughter. Susan briefly falls out with Summer when she tries to warn her about Bradley. Susan's sister, Carmel, comes to visit and she develops feelings for Karl. Carmel makes sexual advances towards Karl, which he rejects. Susan is angry with Carmel, but eventually forgives her. Susan is shocked when she learns Paul has sold the Erinsborough News, without consulting her. Things become worse for Susan when she learns that Sarah Beaumont is overseeing {{the sale of the}} paper. Sarah apologises to Susan for everything that happened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> Susan struggles to deal with her presence. When Karl tells her that he loves her, Susan rejects him. She later hands him divorce papers and confronts Sarah.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) {{wrote in}} his Meteorology of how the earth had the {{potential}} for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC–480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores. Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how {{what was once the}} Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.|$|E
5|$|The diverse ethno-linguistic {{groups of}} Tripura have {{given rise to}} a {{composite}} culture. The dominant ethnic groups are Bengali, Tripuri (Debbarma, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, Koloi, Murasing, Chakma, Halam, Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Uchoi, Dhamai, Roaza, Mogh, Manipuri, and other tribal groups such as Munda, Oraon and Santhal who migrated in Tripura as a tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main indigenous, non-Tripura culture. Indeed, many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> in today's generation more Tripuris are embracing their culture. The Tripuri kings were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language was the language of the court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{south tower}} forms an unequal {{pentagon}} in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built {{to contain the}} stairs and garderobes, the unevenly positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and this meant that two large buttresses had {{to be added to}} the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current floors are Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters at the windows providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.|$|E
5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like most contemporary Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now very familiar with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>But</b> the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and experience would have been limited. According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to try to break through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>but</b> there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E
