5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, {{but as a}} wheelchair basketball player {{rather than as a}} fencer. She was introduced to the sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E

5|$|The Marathas {{were still}} in a very strong {{position}} when the new Governor General of British controlled territories Cornwallis arrived in India in 1786. After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed {{more than two decades}} of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of Nana Phadnavis, the Brahmin minister in the court of the 11-year-old Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. The situation changed soon after Nana's death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in Pune in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa Baji Rao II fled Pune to safety on a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the treaty of Bassein. This made the Peshwa <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> subsidiary ally of the British.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, {{president}} of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed New Mexico Highlands University), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, the first U.S. law to protect relics; it was, <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> direct consequence of Wetherill's controversial activities at Chaco. The Act also authorized the President to establish national monuments: on March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Chaco Canyon National Monument. Wetherill relinquished his land claims.|$|E

5|$|These were cohortes with a cavalry {{contingent}} attached. There {{is evidence}} that their numbers expanded {{with the passage of}} time. Only about 40% of attested cohortes are specifically attested as equitatae in inscriptions, which is probably the original Augustan proportion. A study of units stationed in Syria in the mid-2nd century found that many units which did not carry the equitata title did in fact contain cavalrymen e.g. by discovery of a tombstone of a cavalryman attached to the cohort. This implies that by that time, at least 70% of cohortes were probably equitatae. The addition of cavalry to a cohort obviously enabled it to carry out a wider range of independent operations. A cohors equitata was <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> self-contained mini-army.|$|E
5|$|By 48 BC, {{after having}} {{defeated}} {{the last of}} his major enemies, Julius Caesar wanted to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed. He assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Caesar held the office of Roman Dictator, and alternated between the Consulship (the chief-magistracy) and the Proconsulship (<b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> military governorship). In 48 BC, Caesar was given the powers of a Plebeian Tribune, which made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the Senate, and allowed him to dominate the legislative process. After Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate, and held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. While the conspirators who had assassinated Caesar were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the peace that resulted was only temporary. Antony and Octavian fought against each other in one last battle in 31 BC. Antony was defeated, and in 30 BC he committed suicide. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the state. The reign of Octavian, whom history remembers as Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, marked the dividing line between the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. By the time this process was complete, Rome had completed its transition from a city-state with a network of dependencies, to the capital of an empire.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The Latin Cross form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up, making it, <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> T-plan.|$|E

5|$|However, for the Kriegsmarine, Operation Cerberus {{had been}} {{operational}} success, but a strategic reverse. The present situation had forced {{them into an}} operation which was <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> strategic withdrawal from the Atlantic. From that point onwards, the German campaign in the Atlantic was to be carried by the U-Boats, unsupported by a surface fleet. With the German ships removed from the French Atlantic ports, the British fleets could contain them much more effectively in Norway and the North Sea. Moreover, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had been damaged by mines and required extensive repairs. Prinz Eugen was torpedoed and her stern collapsed just weeks after Cerberus. All three ships were out of action for extended periods. More bad luck followed, with Gneisenau being knocked out for good in February 1942 and {{the sinking of the}} Scharnhorst in December 1943. None of the ships sailed in the Atlantic again in the intervening period, leaving the Battle of the Atlantic to be carried on by U-Boat forces.|$|E
5|$|In late fall, Empress Anna twice sent {{embassies}} to Dušan {{trying to}} convince him to surrender Kantakouzenos, but the Serbian ruler, seeking to extract more profit from their alliance, refused. Kantakouzenos' fortunes began to improve when a delegation of the nobles of Thessaly reached him and offered to accept his authority. Kantakouzenos appointed his relative John Angelos as the province's governor. Although <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> semi-independent ruler, Angelos was both loyal and effective. He soon brought Epirus—which he had governed in Andronikos II's name in 1340—into the Kantakouzenist camp, and even made gains in Thessaly {{at the expense of}} the Catalans of Athens. Another effort by Kantakouzenos to break from Serbia into Macedonia failed before Serres. In the meantime, Kantakouzenos' wife Irene called upon the aid of the Bulgarians to help relieve the blockade of Demotika by the regency's army. Ivan Alexander dispatched troops, but although they clashed with the regency's forces, they made no effort in assisting the city, instead pillaging the countryside.|$|E
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{divided the}} {{interior}} of the old Roman fort into two fortified enclosures, referred to as the inner and outer baileys. The inner bailey of the castle was, <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> castle within a castle, consisting of a walled fortification with a tower at each corner, surrounded by a moat and with a keep of unusual design at its eastern extremity, adjoining the old Roman curtain wall. The present stone fortifications of the inner bailey date mainly from the 13th and 14th centuries. They replaced the original wood and earth fortifications of the Norman inner bailey, which occupied a much larger area of the Roman fort's interior. Traces of the Norman bailey's ditch and earthen rampart, which stretched right across {{the interior of}} the fort, can still be seen today. The inner bailey protected the castle's most important domestic buildings, while the outer bailey was used for buildings of lesser importance such as a granary for the manor of Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
5|$|With no {{casualties}} {{observed on}} the Indian side, both missile attacks (Trident and Python) led the Pakistan Navy to take extreme measures {{to prevent any}} further damage. The rescue efforts were immediately coordinated by Rear Admiral Patrick Simpson who kept morale high among the Pakistani Navy officers. For this, {{he was awarded the}} Sitara-e-Jurat. Lieutenant Commander Vijai Jerath, the commanding officer of Vinash, was awarded the Vir Chakra for this operation. The Pakistani High Command ordered ships to reduce their ammunition dumps so as to reduce the explosion damage, if hit. The ships were also ordered not to manoeuvre out at sea, especially during the night, unless ordered to do so. These two measures severely demoralized Pakistani naval crews. With the destruction caused by the Indian Navy, neutral merchant vessels soon started to seek safe passage from the Indian authorities before heading to Karachi. Gradually, neutral ships ceased sailing for Karachi. <b>In</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>a</b> de facto naval blockade was created by the Indian Navy.|$|E
