5|$|Plutonium was {{delivered}} to Los Alamos {{in the form of}} what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride (PuF3) and plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons.

It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>race</b> against the clock, the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by July 23, 1945.|$|E
