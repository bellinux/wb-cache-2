5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E

The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
