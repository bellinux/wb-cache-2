5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> Victor IV.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Antioch (8 June 218) {{was fought}} between the Roman armies of the Emperor Macrinus and <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> Elagabalus, whose troops were {{commanded}} by General Gannys, probably {{a short distance}} from Antioch. Gannys' victory over Macrinus led to the downfall of the emperor and his replacement by Elagabalus.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with <b>his</b> <b>rival,</b> but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E

5|$|After Wu's reign, Han forces {{continued}} {{to prevail against}} the Xiongnu.

5|$|After {{defeating}} Maxentius in 312, Constantine disbanded the Praetorian Guard, {{ending the}} latter's 300-year existence. Although the instant reason was the Guard's support for <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> Maxentius, a force based in Rome had also become obsolete since emperors now rarely resided there. The imperial escort {{role of the}} Guard's cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, was now fulfilled by the scholae. These elite cavalry regiments existed {{by the time of}} Constantine and may have been founded by Diocletian.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His {{accession}} to power ended a decade-long period of heightened conflict between the two royal families. Sparta's ancient dual kingship was explained by the founding legend, that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> king, the reformist Agis IV.|$|E
5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to <b>his</b> <b>rival,</b> Paige.

The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E

5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. <b>His</b> <b>rival</b> James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
