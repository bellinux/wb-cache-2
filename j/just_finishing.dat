25|$|When Trent Reznor was {{originally}} asked by director David Fincher to score The Social Network, he initially declined, {{partly due to}} <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> up a long touring and recording schedule. After further reflecting, Reznor apologized and told Fincher {{to keep him in}} consideration, to which he told Reznor that he had been waiting for him to accept.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E

500|$|At {{the music}} {{industry}} trade fair Midem in 2008, Paul McGuinness said No Line on the Horizon would be ready for release in October 2008. Lanois corroborated that in June 2008, stating the album should be ready in 3–4 weeks. He said, [...] "We're <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> the vocals. Bono's in great form, singing fantastic." [...] On 3September 2008, U2.com posted an article in which Bono revealed that the new album would be out [...] "in early 2009", also noting that [...] "around 50–60 songs" [...] had been recorded in the sessions. It was later confirmed the album would be released on 27February 2009 in Ireland, 2March in the UK, and 3March in North America. The gap between How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and No Line on the Horizon release was the longest of the band's career to that point.|$|E
500|$|During the 1933 track season, Ward was so {{dominant}} that he {{was dubbed}} Michigan's “one-man track team” and became a national sensation. [...] He led Michigan to Big Ten championships in both indoor and outdoor track. Going into the Big Ten track meet in May 1933, Ward was expected to dominate. Coach Hoyt described Ward as “a good ‘un,” and praised him for his unassuming character and tolerance of the spotlight of publicity. [...] One report noted: “He is altogether likeable, for he always speaks without raising his voice and never protests a decision. [...] … Ward is a star now, but he is <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> his first year of competition. Unless injuries hamper him it is likely he will be as great an attraction or possibly even greater than the two Negro track stars who preceded him here, DeHart Hubbard and Eddie Tolan.” ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

2500|$|In January 1870, Fr. O'Rourke, the Professor of French and English, whom Sheehan {{describes}} as a [...] "very gentle, polished man", was obliged to leave the College and go abroad for health reasons. [...] He was replaced by Fr. James J. Murphy (1841-1875), a young priest of the archdiocese of Dublin, who was then <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> his postgraduate research on the Dunboyne Establishment. [...] Sheehan regarded him as [...] "one of the most remarkable, if {{not one of the}} most distinguished, students that ever passed through Maynooth". [...] To the [...] "young hero-worshippers, sick and tired of logic-chopping, and the awful dullness of the morning classes, he came as a herald of light and leading".|$|E
2500|$|The second Royal Navy [...] "ship" [...] to {{be called}} HMS King Alfred was the shore {{establishment}} sited at Hove in Sussex. In 1939 on {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the Navy was searching for a site for a training depot for officers of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). [...] The Sussex Division of the RNVR was based in Hove and its motor launch, ML 1649, was called HMS King Alfred and near to the divisional base was a new leisure centre that was <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> construction. [...] The Admiralty immediately requisitioned the leisure centre and on 11 September 1939 commissioned it as HMS King Alfred under the command of Captain John Pelly.|$|E

[...] On April 15, 2011, she wrote a Pattaya Music Fest article on The Philippine Star where she also talked about the album, saying [...] "Late last year, I moved to my new record label Universal Records and I consider it one of the biggest blessings in my career. In a few months, my latest album will be released, and it will showcase a new, yet familiar Nina, which I hope everyone will appreciate." [...] In May, the label's head Kathleen Dy-Go stated that Nina has not yet finished recording the album, which may result the release date to be pushed back to July or August. On May 31, Nina confirmed that [...] "Hagkan" [...] will be included in the album. On July 15, she confirmed that the album will be released by the end of month, and that they were <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> up three songs. She further stated that her commitment to the album was the reason behind her constant absence in ASAP. On August 5, 2011, Jay R tweeted that he was working on a collaboration song between Nina and Jimmy Muna. On August 16, Nina tweeted her first publicized picture from the album's photo shoot. In September 2011, she confirmed that the album will finally be released by the last week of the month, proudly expressing the time and effort she exerted for it. She also stated that she did not pressure herself during its production, saying that her main goal is to create a different kind of music for her fans and that she does not expect for it to be a huge hit. Despite announcements, the album was not released until November 2011.|$|E
