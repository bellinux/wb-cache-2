500|$|Homer's chants and his {{nickname}} [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] is {{a reference to}} American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy, who earned the nickname [...] "The Roar from Thirty-Four" [...] for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his arms. A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" [...] written by Henry Mancini. Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26-minute-long performance of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the game where Homer performs his first dance. Homer's line, [...] "Today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot {{on the face of}} the earth" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> farewell speech to the Springfield fans, is a reference to Lou Gehrig's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees. The song [...] "Capital City" [...] that Bennett sings over the closing credits is a parody of the 1980 song [...] "New York, New York".|$|E
2500|$|For a long time, Plato's unwritten {{doctrine}} {{had been}} controversial. Many modern books on Plato seem to diminish its importance; nevertheless, the first important witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, {{who in his}} Physics (209 b) writes: [...] "It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [...] of the participant is different from what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> so-called unwritten teachings (ἄγραφα δόγματα)." [...] The term [...] "ἄγραφα δόγματα" [...] literally means unwritten doctrines and it stands for the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public. The importance of the unwritten doctrines {{does not seem to}} have been seriously questioned before the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, in {{the high}} priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the {{protection}} and sanctification of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: [...] "I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.". Paul instructs the elders in Ephesus [...] "to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter to the same church that [...] "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." [...] Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life [...] "for his friends," [...] and an angel tells Jesus' earthly father Joseph that he [...] "will save His people from their sins". Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.|$|E
6000|$|We are now {{informed}} that Mrs. Clermont, whom <b>he</b> afterwards <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letters was a spy of Lady Byron's mother, set herself to make mischief between them. He says:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you choose}} to offer us, Monsieur Herbrand," [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old-world but perfect French. [...] "If Madame has any fancy, we will send you a message." ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{the time}} when the heart of the Dominie would be touched with pity, and <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bright way: [...] "Now, children, I am going to read you something!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The leading {{motif of}} Torquemada's monumental history – {{elaborated}} by him in many places, {{especially in the}} general prologue to the entire work – can be characterised as the merciful action of Divine Providence in choosing the Spanish to liberate the Indians from their subjection to the Devil who had deceived these innocent peoples into practising a religion marred by errors and polluted by abominations such as human sacrifice. [...] On this interpretation {{the fall of the}} Aztec monarchy was a Divine chastisement and Spain the rod. But, for all that, Torquemada was sympathetic to the positive achievements of the Indians, and, by situating their history and culture {{within the framework of the}} Old Testament and of the former glories of the empires of Egypt, Greece and Rome, he encouraged the educated elite of the Old World to recognise the indigenous nations of the New World as their peers. [...] His history was, of set purpose, a laborious inquiry into the truth of things, requiring (as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> general prologue) diligence, maturation, and the exercise of prudence in adjudicating among conflicting testimonies. [...] It was not written as an entertainment or to satisfy mere curiosity, but with a serious didactic purpose and to edify, for he believed that the record of the events of the past constitute not only an antidote to human mortality and the brevity of life, but also a hermeneutic key to understanding the present, thereby offering man an opportunity to progress.|$|E
6000|$|We'll {{hope for}} luck. [...] Blucher {{concentrates}} certainly by now [...] Near Ligny, as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dispatch. [...] Your Grace, I glean, will mass at Quatre-Bras? ...|$|E
6000|$|It is as a lyric poet that we {{have studied}} M. De Banville. [...] "Je ne m'entends qu'a la meurique," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ballad on himself; but he can write prose when he pleases.|$|E
2500|$|His {{love of the}} Persian {{language}} is evident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works and poetry. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> one of <b>his</b> poems: ...|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the only}} work Tchaikovsky ever wrote for the {{combination}} of piano, violin, and cello. <b>In</b> 1880, <b>his</b> benefactress Nadezhda von Meck, had asked for such a piece, but <b>he</b> refused, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter to her of 5 November 1880: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{a man for}} you! He {{can smell}} more'n the most of folks can see, an' when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it's <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind that a thing is so or so, you can set it down as comin' mighty near to bein' a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{have caught}} the raging epidemic, I see,' said Mr. Pole, with a sneer. 'However, there is the marvellous young gentleman! [...] "Alone in a crowd," [...] as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> last poem. Very interesting!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't imagine," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sure, fine accents, [...] "how {{much the}} Change has {{destroyed}} of me. I still don't feel awake. Men of my sort are so tremendously MADE; I never suspected it before." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bowman sighed. [...] "I thought, {{after all}} these years, {{that he must be}} dead," [...] she said, slowly, [...] "or else married. But <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter that he has kept single for my sake all these years." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2010, {{regarding}} President Obama, Rockefeller said, [...] "He says 'I'm {{for clean}} coal,' and then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> speeches, but <b>he</b> doesn't <b>say</b> it <b>in</b> here ..... And <b>he</b> doesn't <b>say</b> it <b>in</b> {{the minds of}} my own people. And he's beginning to not be believable to me." ...|$|R
50|$|On May 4, 2015 {{before the}} start of 2015 PBA Governors' Cup Mercado was traded to Barangay Ginebra in {{exchange}} of Joseph Yeo. Mercado promised that he will do anything for Ginebra because <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> is <b>in</b> <b>his</b> best shape of his career. Mercado debuted for Barangay Ginebra on May 8, 2015 against the team that drafted him, the Alaska Aces, but his new team lost.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> rose, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart, 'It is enough,' He went {{behind the}} small hill, {{and looked at}} the night. It was all exposed. He wanted to hide, to cover himself from the openness, and there was not even a bush under which he could find cover.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it is {{valuable}} or not, and neither does father. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> telegram it is certainly worth several thousand dollars, and he doesn't know but {{that it may be}} worth a hundred thousand dollars or more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Highwaymen and housebreakers," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Life of Gay, [...] "seldom [...] {{frequent}} the playhouse, or mingle in any elegant diversion; {{nor is it}} [...] {{possible for}} any one to imagine that he may rob with safety, because [...] he sees Macheath reprieved upon the stage." ...|$|E
6000|$|So he says {{exactly what}} Adam and Eve said in their hearts--"I will eat {{of the tree}} of {{knowledge}} of good and evil." [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart, too, just what Solomon the wise said, when he, too, determined to eat of {{the fruit of the}} tree of knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very possible," [...] {{suggested}} Mrs. Sewell, [...] "that <b>he</b> did <b>say</b> something <b>in</b> <b>his</b> awkward {{way that}} she misconstrued into impertinence." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stallard {{fell out}} with the {{organisation}} <b>he</b> had founded, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> private papers that the LVRC was not [...] "up to expectation" [...] and adding: ...|$|R
5000|$|... ("Uh-huh, oh yeah!" [...] {{eventually}} became Trent's trademark phrase and <b>he</b> still <b>says</b> it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shows, usually {{accompanied by a}} double thumbs-up gesture.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear dad! How {{could you}} {{possibly}} know? As <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter, it {{has given me a}} lesson. But he was so much older and so much more experienced, that {{it was hard for me}} to ask to examine his books. But we must waste no time. I must go to the City." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I will," [...] she answered, [...] "if Waster Lunny would haud his wheesht for a minute. You see the {{afternoon}} diet {{began in the}} ordinary way, and a' was richt until {{we came to the}} sermon. 'You will find my text,' <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> piercing voice, 'in the eighth chapter of Ezra.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, madame!" [...] said M. Lacordaire; and, {{as he said}} it, {{much more}} was {{expressed}} in his face than in his words. But, then, you can neither accept nor reject a gentleman by what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face. He blushed, too, up to his grizzled hair, and, turning round, walked {{a step or two}} away from the widow's seat, and back again.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the six {{citizens}} summoned arrived. The evidence was again given, and then the prisoner was asked what <b>he</b> had to <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> defence.|$|R
5000|$|Tryon is {{not able}} to explain how one of these virtual {{particles}} grows to become a universe like ours, but <b>he</b> does <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> paper [...] "that the laws of physics place no limit on the scale of vacuum fluctuations". He also mentions <b>in</b> <b>his</b> paper how [...] "vacuum fluctuations of our Universe are probably quite rare".|$|R
5000|$|In Vladimir Nabokovs novel Pale Fire, Professor Kinbote <b>says</b> <b>he</b> placed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lodging-house [...] "the {{reproduction}} of a beloved early Picasso: earth boy leading raincloud horse".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{she said}} in a {{doubtful}} tone. Something of old Nelson's dread of the authorities had rubbed off on the girl since she had to live with it day after day. [...] "I don't know. Papa's afraid of being reduced to beggary, as <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old days. Look here, kid, you had better clear out to-morrow, first thing." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{appears to}} be the {{philosophy}} of prefaces in general, and perhaps authors might be more daring and candid than they are with advantage, and write regular criticisms of their own books in their prefaces, for nobody can be so good a critic of himself as the author--if he has a sense of humour. If he has not, the less <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> preface the better.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} will get over it," [...] he said, to the farmer's wife. [...] "It is a nasty cut; {{but there is nothing}} {{dangerous}} in the wound, itself. It is the general shock to the system, together with the hardships and suffering he had gone through. He is a mere boy--not above seventeen or eighteen. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> note he is a captain, but it can hardly be so." ...|$|E
60|$|Robert, too, {{will tell}} you that he hates all Buonapartes, past, present, or to come, but then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> self-willed, pettish way, as a manner of dismissing a subject he won't think about--and knowing very well that he doesn't think about it, not mistaking a feeling for a reason, not for a moment. There's the {{difference}} between women and men.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Virginia, smiling, [...] "he is asleep. Mammy Easter is with him, {{trying to}} make out what <b>he</b> is <b>saying.</b> <b>He</b> talks <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sleep, just as you do--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Wilful murder?' <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> quiet way. 'What the deuce is that? What are {{you talking}} about? People do get killed {{sometimes}} when they get in one's way, but that's self-defence--you understand?' ...|$|R
