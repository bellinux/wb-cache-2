25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{irrigation}} {{that can be}} used in viticulture depending on the amount of control and water management desired. Historically, surface irrigation was the most common means using the gravity of a slope to release a flood of water across the vineyard. In the early history of the Chilean wine industry, <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> was widely practiced in the vineyards using melted snow from the Andes Mountains channeled down to the valleys below. This method provided very little control and often had the adverse effect of over-watering the vine. An adaption of method was the furrow irrigation system used in Argentina where small channels ran through the vineyard providing irrigation. This provide slightly more control since the initial amount of water entering the channels could be regulated, however the amount that each vine received was sporadic.|$|E
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the high}} water {{consuming}} crops and it is important to utilize methods in its production to promote water use efficiency. In order to achieve this purpose, a split plot experiment was conducted in direct-seeding of rice in Kazerun region of Fars province, Iran, in 2007. Five <b>irrigation</b> treatments (full-season <b>flooding,</b> full-season alternating, flooding until tillering stage, flooding until stem elongation, and flooding until flowering) were arranged in main plots and subplots consisted of three rice cultivars (Fajr, Shafagh and native Champa). The results indicated that Fajr cultivar with 4538 kg/ha and Champa with 1734 kg/ha produced the highest and the lowest grain yield, respectively. Alternating irrigation caused reduction in plant height, biological yield and grain number and weight. Grain yield in alternating <b>irrigation,</b> <b>flooding</b> until tillering, flooding until stem elongation and flooding until flowering was reduced 30, 26, 26 and 4 percent, respectively, as compared to full-season <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation</b> while, water use efficiency in these treatments was 92, 60, 0 and 22 percent higher than full-season <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation.</b> In all alternating irrigation treatments water consumption was lower than flooding. Despite lower grain yields in these treatments, the water use efficiency was improved. The highest water use efficiency was observed in full-season alternating irrigation treatment. Therefore, according to the results, <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation</b> until flowering or stem elongation could be considered for acceptable grain yield and water use productivity, instead of full-season <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation,</b> in future researches...|$|R

25|$|Historically, <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> was {{the most}} common method used, whereby large amounts of water are allowed to run across flat {{vineyard}} lands. While this method may have been an unwittingly preventive measure against the advance of phylloxera, it does not provide much control for the vineyard manager to limit yields and increase potential quality in the wine grapes. Subsequently, a method of furrow irrigation was developed whereby water is funneled into furrow channels that the vines are planted in. While providing a little more control, this method was still more suited to producing high yields. In the late 1990s, drip irrigation started to become more popular. Though expensive to install, this method provides for the maximum level of control by the vineyard manager to facilitate yield control and increase potential quality in the grape by leveraging water stress on the vine.|$|E
25|$|Malbec is very {{susceptible}} to various grape diseases and viticultural hazards—most notably frost, coulure, downey mildew and rot but {{the development of}} new clones and vineyard management techniques have helped control some of these potential problems. When it is not afflicted with these various ailments, particularly coulure, it does have the potential to produce high yields. Too high a yield, as was the circumstance in Argentina until recently with their heavy use of <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the wines become more simplistic and lacking in flavor. Malbec seems to be able to produce well in a variety of soil types but in the limestone based soils of Cahors it seems to produce its most dark and tannic manifestation. There are distinct ampelographical differences in the clones of Malbec found in France and in Argentina, with Argentine Malbec tending to have smaller berries.|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{center around}} the broader {{environmental}} impact of irrigation on both the ecosystem around the vineyard {{as well as the}} added strain on global water resources. While advances in drip irrigation has reduced the amount of waste water produced by irrigation, the irrigation of substantial tracts of land in areas like the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia requires massive amounts of water from dwindling supplies. In Australia, the centuries-old practice of <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> used in places like the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area caused severe environmental damages from water-logging, increase salination and raising the water tables. In 2000, the Australian government invested over A$3.6 million into research on how to minimize the damage caused by extensive irrigation. In 2007, concerns about ecological damage to the Russian River caused government officials in California to take similar measures to cut back water supplies and promote more efficient irrigation practices.|$|E

25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation,</b> like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} Peter Gleick comments: [...] "Few rational observers {{deny the}} need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries {{is the concept of}} peak water. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world’s major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California’s Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred [...] The {{good news is that the}} potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{bioaccumulation}} {{of arsenic}} compounds in rice {{is of great}} concern worldwide because rice is the staple food for billions of people and arsenic {{is one of the}} most toxic and carcinogenic elements at even trace amounts. The uptake of arsenic compounds in rice comes mainly from its interaction with system soil/water in the reducing conditions typical of paddy fields and is influenced by the irrigation used. We demonstrate that the use of sprinkler irrigation produces rice kernels with a concentration of total arsenic about fifty times lower when compared to rice grown under continuous <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The average total amount of arsenic, measured by a fully validated ICP-MS method, in 37 rice grain genotypes grown with sprinkler irrigation was 2. 8 ± 2. 5 μ g kg - 1, whereas the average amount measured in the same genotypes grown under identical conditions, but using continuous <b>flooding</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 163 ± 23 μ g kg(- 1). In addition, we find that the average concentration of total arsenic in rice grains cultivated under sprinkler irrigation is close to the total arsenic concentration found in irrigation waters.
