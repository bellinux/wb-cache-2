For the neutralization of static charge in a larger area, such as a factory floor or workshop, antistatic systems may utilize electron emission effects such as corona discharge or photoemission that introduce ions into the area that combine with and neutralize any electrically charged object.

50|$|Copper {{is vital}} to the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> system for wind turbine farms. Turbine masts attract {{lightning}} strikes, so they require lightning protection systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the nacelle (gearbox/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a grounding system. The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper conductor that runs along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The grounding system, {{at the base of the}} mast, consists of a thick copper ring conductor bonded to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.|$|E
5000|$|During {{this brief}} interval, {{the lack of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> caused a {{substantial}} current to flow through an electrical relay {{which was supposed to}} trigger normal engine cut-off at the end of powered flight. This relay tripped, causing the Redstone to shut off its engine and send a [...] "normal cut-off" [...] signal to the capsule. Under normal circumstances, when the capsule received this signal during a flight, it would do two things: it would jettison its escape rocket, which was no longer of any use, and after the escape rocket had flown clear, fire the explosive bolts holding it to the booster for separation. In the case of MR-1, the capsule did jettison the escape rocket as it was designed to, but the separation sequence did not occur. The capsule was designed to suspend this separation until the vehicle's acceleration had almost ceased, so that the capsule would not be hit by a still-accelerating launch vehicle. This would happen when the capsule's acceleration sensors detected an acceleration approaching 0 g, which it would normally experience after the Redstone had shut down and was entering free fall. However, in MR-1, the Redstone was not in free fall but rather sitting supported on the ground. Thus the capsule sensors detected the effect of their own supported weight, which they read as a constant [...] "acceleration" [...] of 1 g. Because of this apparent acceleration, capsule separation was disabled.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> is {{probably}} the most over-looke~ ignored, and misunderstood part of electrical energy source circuits. A faulty ground circuit am have lethal potential to the worker, can damage electrical equipment" or components, and can lead to higher consequences. For example, if the green-wire ground return circuit (in a three-wire power circuit) is fhulty or is open (someone cut the prong, etc.) a person can receive an electrical shock by touching the conductive enclosure, and the result can be lethal. If high explosives are involved m the process, sneak electrical energy paths may cause electrical threats that lead to ignition, which results to higher damage consequences. Proper <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> is essential to mitigate the electrical hazard and improve work place safety. A designer must ask the question, "What grounding is proper?" continuously through a process design and in its application. This question must be readdressed with any process change, including tiom layout, equipment, or procedure changes. <b>Electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> varies ilom local work area grounding to the multi-point grounding found in large industrial areas. These grounding methods become more complex when the designer adds bonding to the grounding schemes to mitigate electrostatic discharge (ESD) and surfkce potentials resulting from lightning currents flowing through the facility structure. Figure 1 shows a typical facility power distribution circuit and the current flow paths resulting ffom a lightning discharge to a facility. This paper discusses <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> methods and their characteristics and identifies potential sneak paths into a process for hazardous electrical energy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcupuncture in Oriental {{medicine}} {{has been widely}} used as a core therapeutic method due to its minimal side-effects and therapeutic efficacy. However, the electrical response to acupuncture stimulation (ERAS) has not been clearly studied under acupuncture conditions that might affect the efficacy of acupuncture therapy. In this study, the ERAS was objectively investigated by measuring meridian electric potentials (MEPs) when the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions of the operator and subject were varied, and when the insulation conditions of acupuncture needle were varied. MEPs between Sang-geoheo (ST 37) and Ha-geoheo (ST 39) of the Stomach Meridian (ST) were measured by stimulating Jok-samni (ST 36) with an acupuncture needle. For non-insulated acupuncture stimulation (NIAS), the average MEP peak was 148. 6 ± 20. 6 when neither the operator nor the subject were electrically grounded, 23. 1 ± 8. 8 when the subject only was electrically grounded, 348 ± 76. 8 when the operator only was electrically grounded, and 19. 9 ± 4. 7 when both the operator and the subject were electrically grounded. The MEPs presented various magnitudes and patterns depending on the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions. The MEP pattern was {{very similar to that}} of the charge and discharge of a capacitor. For insulated acupuncture stimulation (IAS), the average MEP peak was 20 ± 4 in all <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions, which is not a significant electric response for acupuncture stimulation.
