Although intramuscular immunization induces the immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) antibody isotype for both antigens, with gene gun immunization, the NP still generated mainly IgG 2 a and the major isotype induced by the HA was IgG 1.

Recently, epigenetic phenomena are important to consider in plant biotechnology experiments for elucidate unknown mechanism. Therefore, soybean immature cotyledons were generated embryogenesis cells and engineered with two different gene constructs (pHV and pHVS) using <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> <b>method.</b> Both constructs contain a gene conferring resistance to hygromycin (_hpt_) as a selective marker and a modified glycinin (11 S globulin) gene (_V 3 - 1 _) as a target.

In the present study we compared the immune responses and protective effects induced by P. berghei CSP genetic vaccines delivered intradermally with a needle or epidermally with a <b>gene</b> <b>gun.</b> Mice were immunized three times at 4 -week intervals and challenged by a single infectious mosquito bite.

40|$|Groundnut {{is grown}} {{worldwide}} {{as an important}} cash crop and its seeds are {{a major source of}} premium quality vegetable oil and protein. Yield loss up to 70 per cent has been reported due to reduced photosynthesis resulting from increase in necrotic leaf area and defoliation after severe attack of leaf spot disease. The best way to control this foliar disease is to grow resistant cultivars, but higher levels of resistance are not available in groundnut cultivars. Genetic transformation is the best alternative in such circumstances and availability of efficient regeneration and gene delivery systems is a prerequisite for this technique. Therefore during present study, regeneration protocols were standardized by culturing three explants of each of four commercial varieties on MS medium supplemented with different hormone combinations, subsequently followed by transformation of best responding variety with chitinase gene. 78. 33 per cent cotyledonary explants responded to shoot induction with 5. 14 shoots/explant in Golden variety on MS medium containing 0. 1 mg/l NAA and 4 mg/l BAP. Roots were induced successfully (61. 30 per cent) on MS medium fortified with 1. 0 mg/l NAA. Direct shoots were induced from 52. 67 per cent leaf disc explants. Somatic embryos were obtained (98. 33 per cent) from epicotyl explants on MS medium having 8 mg/l picloram. 14. 18 per cent transformation efficiency through Agrobacterium, 6. 88 per cent by silicon carbide whisker and 6. 59 per cent by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> <b>method</b> has been achieved. This is first known report of Silicon carbide whisker mediated transformation in peanut in world. The transgene (RCG 3) over expressed well and showed significant resistance to the Tikka disease. In present study it has been proven that rice chitinase gene (RCG- 3) confers strong resistance against leaf spot disease of peanut. The stable peanut lines produced will be helpful to evolve cultivars with built-in solution to control fungal diseases, specially the leaf spot.

40|$|Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.), {{is second}} {{important}} cash crop in Pakistan, but yield is low {{due to a}} number of factors. Among these, biotic (insect, pest, diseases) and abiotic (drought, salt, low and high temperature) stresses are major one, which cause loss to sugarcane crop. Sugarcane requires high delta of water and moisture stress at growth phase causes considerable yield loss (~ 17 %). In case of severe shortage of water or prolonged drought conditions, yield loss may rise up to 70 % and some time complete crop failure. Saline and saline sodic soils also hinder sugarcane production in Pakistan. Sugarcane varietal improvement through conventional breeding is difficult in Pakistan, due to lack of viable cane fuzz production. Through the application of biotechnological approaches, transgenic sugarcane could be developed for better cane and sugar yield per unit area. The target for specific trait improvement could be achieved through the transformation of single or multiple genes. The present study was conducted with the objectives to optimize ideal tissue culture system for different commercial and promising clones of sugarcane and genetic transformation of multiple genes (AtNHX 1, AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac) in the better tissue culture responding clones through particle <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> <b>method.</b> Tissue culture system was established for the five commercially grown (HSF- 240, SPF- 213, SPF- 237, CPF- 245, CPF- 246), and two promising sugarcane clones (CSSG- 668, CSSG- 676). Optimal medium composition for callusing, embryogenesis, regeneration, rooting and selection of transformed sugarcane plants were achieved. The best callus induction was found in the media combination (4 mgL- 1 2, 4 -D, 0. 5 gL- 1 casein hydrolysate, 3. 5 mgL- 1 each of arginine, glycine, cystine and 7. 5 % coconut H 2 O). For regeneration, the media combination SR- 3 (0. 25 mg L- 1 2, 4 -D, 2. 5 mgL- 1 each of arginine, glycine and cystine, 1. 5, 0. 25, 0. 50 mgL- 1 BAP, Kinetin and NAA respectively) was observed optimal. For the profuse roots development of the regenerated plantlets, 3. 5 IBA and 2. 5 mgL- 1 BAP was found best medium combination. For the selection of transformed sugarcane calli and plantlets, geneticin at 40 - 60 mgL- 1 was found optimum. The best tissue culture responsive sugarcane clones (HSF- 240 and CSSG- 668) were selected for the transformation and integration of multiple genes in the combinations; C- 1 (AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac), C- 2 (AVP 1 and AtNHX 1) and C- 3 (AtNHX 1 and Cry 1 Ac) through biolistic transformation method. Embryogenic calli of the selected sugarcane clones were bombarded in 42 batches. Two hundred and ninety putative transgenic sugarcane lines were obtained after selection at regeneration. Out of these, 177 plantlets produced roots on rooting selection medium. The putative transgenic plants were initially screened through kanamycin leaf assay and 168 were found resistant which were further confirmed through PCR amplification of the selection marker npt 11 gene. Out of the selected putative transgenic lines, 155 were found PCR positive. The npt 11 positive plants were then used to amplify specific genes. The PCR results showed 38 plants positive for AVP 1, 34 for Cry 1 Ac, 32 for AtNHX 1, 15 for AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac, 13 for AVP 1 and AtNHX 1, and 13 for Cry 1 Ac and AtNHX 1. Integration pattern was confirmed through Southern analysis. There was observed random integration pattern, two to six insertions of transgene in each line. Biological assay for top borers was conducted for the plants positive for Cry 1 Ac gene, in controlled conditions. The transgenic lines positive for Cry 1 Ac gene showed significant resistance to top borer (Scirpophaga novella) as compared to the control (non transgenic). Selected transgenic plants positive for AVP 1 and AtNHX 1 were planted in pots and micro plots under salt stress and water deficient conditions, for the agronomic and physiological studies. Agronomic parameters such as germination %, cane girth, length and weight were studied. There was found better response of the transgenics for quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Transgenic lines showed significant tolerance for deficient irrigation (80 and 63 %) and salt stress (E. Ce 7. 5 and 10 dS m- 1) as compared to the non transgenic lines. Studies on diversity among Saccharum complex for lignin related genes, showed 43 % polymorphism. Principal coordinate analysis showed that, 29 % of the total variation was explained by the genotypes with respect to the lignin-related genes. The association of genetic variation in Saccharum complex will be helpful in designing breeding strategies for the development of superior energy cane with more biomass. Multiple gene integration in sugarcane will be helpful for tolerance against biotic (borers) and abiotic (drought and salt) stresses, which ultimately will lead to higher cane and sugar yield with better economic return to the farmers and sugar industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A {{control circuit}} of a <b>gene</b> <b>gun,</b> which employs {{electromagnetic}} force as power source based on electromagnetic mechanics, is proposed {{in this paper}}.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] Context: <b>Gene</b> <b>guns</b> have been used to deliver deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) loaded micro-particle and breach the muscle tissue to target cells of interest to achieve gene transfection. Objective: This article aims to discuss the potential of microneedle (MN) assisted micro-particle delivery from <b>gene</b> <b>guns,</b> with a view to reducing tissue damage. Methods: Using a range of sources, the main <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> for micro-particle delivery are reviewed along with the primary features of their technology, e. g. their design configurations, the material selection of the micro-particle, the driving gas type and pressure. Depending on the <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> system, the achieved penetration depths in the skin are discussed {{as a function of the}} gas pressure, the type of the <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> system and particle size, velocity and density. The concept of MN-assisted micro-particles delivery which consists of three stages (namely, acceleration, separation and decoration stage) is discussed. In this method, solid MNs are inserted into the skin to penetrate the epidermis/dermis layer and create holes for particle injection. Several designs of MN array are discussed and the insertion mechanism is explored, as it determines the feasibility of the MN-based system for particle transfer. Results: This review suggests that one of the problems of <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> is that they need high operating pressures, which may result in direct or indirect tissue/cells damage. MNs seem to be a promising method which if combined with the <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> may reduce the operating pressures for these devices and reduce tissue/cell damages.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{developed a}} virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) vector for cotton from the bipartite geminivirus Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV). The original CLCrV VIGS vector {{was designed for}} biolistic delivery by a <b>gene</b> <b>gun.</b> This prerequisite limited {{the use of the}} system to labs with access to biolistic equipment. Here we describe the adaptation of this system for delivery by Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens). We also describe the construction of two low-cost particle inflow guns. Results The biolistic CLCrV vector was transferred into two Agrobacterium binary plasmids. Agroinoculation of the binary plasmids into cotton resulted in silencing and GFP expression comparable to the biolistic vector. Two homemade low-cost <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> were used to successfully inoculate cotton (G. hirsutum) and N. benthamiana with either the CLCrV VIGS vector or the Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) VIGS vector respectively.

40|$|Transfection and {{subsequent}} expression of DNA in living neuronal tissue is problematic and no technique has emerged {{that is completely}} non-damaging, efficient and reproducible. The Bio-Rad hand-held <b>Gene</b> <b>Gun</b> has overcome {{some of these problems}} by exploiting a biolistic method in which small gold particles carrying plasmid DNA are propelled into neurons whilst causing minimal detectable cell damage. In its current configuration, however, the Bio-Rad <b>Gene</b> <b>Gun</b> is optimised for transfecting cells in dispersed cultures, and therefore delivers particles superficially over a relatively wide area. Here we report modifications to the Bio-Rad <b>Gene</b> <b>Gun</b> that both enhance its accuracy by restricting its target area, and increase the depth penetration achieved by gold particles, thereby allowing smaller and deeper tissues to be transfected. These alterations make the modified <b>Gene</b> <b>Gun</b> more applicable for in vitro transfection of organotypic cultures and enhance its potential utility for in vivo gene delivery. Moreover, the modified configuration operates successfully at lower gas pressures, thereby reducing even further the degree of cell damage incurred during transfection. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{are potential}} tools for the induction of immune responses against both infectious disease and cancer. The dermal application of DNA vaccines {{is of particular}} interest since the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin are characterized by an abundance of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The aim of our study was to compare tumor protection as obtained by two different methods of intradermal DNA delivery (<b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> and jet injector) in a well-established HER 2 /neu mouse tumor model. BALB/c mice were immunized twice with a HER 2 /neu-coding plasmid by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> or jet injector. Mice were then subcutaneously challenged with HER 2 /neu+ syngeneic D 2 F 2 /E 2 tumor cells. Protection against subsequent challenges with tumor cells as well as humoral and T-cell immune responses induced by the vaccine were monitored. <b>Gene</b> <b>gun</b> immunization was far superior to jet injector both in terms of tumor protection and induction of HER 2 /neu-specific immune responses. After <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> immunization, 60 % of the mice remained tumor-free until day 140 as compared with 25 % after jet injector immunization. Furthermore, <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> vaccination was able to induce both a strong TH 1 -polarized T-cell response with detectable cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity and a humoral immune response against HER 2 /neu, whereas the jet injector was not.

40|$|DNA immunization, {{inoculation}} with an antigen-expressing plasmid DNA, is a {{new method}} for generating an antigen-specific immune response. At the time these investigations began, very little was known about the immune response produced by DNA vaccines. Thus, the first aim of our studies was to perform a detailed examination of the antibody response generated by DNA immunization with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) -expressing DNA in BALB/c mice. Using several different routes and methods of DNA immunization, we observed a number of findings. Although all three forms of DNA immunization elicited strong anti-HA antibody responses, i. m. and i. d. saline DNA immunization required approximately 100 times more DNA than a <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization to raise an equivalent titer of anti-HA antibody. Indeed, as little as one inoculation and one boost by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> of 0. 0004 μg of DNA produced a measurable antibody response in 50 % of mice. Unexpectedly, we found the isotype of the antibody response differed among groups of mice immunized by different forms of DNA immunization. Intramuscular and i. d. saline DNA immunization produced predominantly an IgG 2 a anti-HA antibody response, whereas <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization elicited mostly an IgG 1 anti-HA antibody response. Considering that IgG 2 a and IgG 1 antibody isotypes were known to correlate with Th 1 and Th 2 immune responses, respectively, we analyzed the type of immune responses produced by i. m., i. d., and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization. We found that i. m. and i. d. saline DNA immunization produced a Th 1 predominant cellular immune response. In contrast, <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization produced a Th 2 cellular immune response. The differences {{in the type of}} immune responses were found to be due to the method of DNA immunization, and not due to the route of DNA inoculation. A <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization of muscle produced the same IgG 1, Th 2 immune response as a <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization of skin, while a saline DNA immunization of muscle and skin produced mostly an IgG 2 a, Th 1 immune response. Each method of DNA immunization created good memory Th cell responses. The type of immune response created by an initial DNA immunization remained fixed even after multiple boosts with the identical method of DNA immunization, following a boost with the alternative method of DNA immunization, or after a viral challenge. The differentiation of naive Th cells into Th 1 or Th 2 cells depends on a variety of factors. We performed many experiments to elucidate which factors {{played a role in the}} generation of Th 1 or Th 2 immune responses following saline DNA immunization and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization. DNA dose response studies revealed the use of different doses of DNA between groups of saline DNA and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunized mice did not account for the differentiation of distinct Th cell subsets. Cytokine production inducible by a number of factors inherently associated with either saline DNA or <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization did not affect Th differentiation. For instance, contamination of plasmid DNA with lipopolysaccharide did not account for differences in the immune response. Immunostimulatory CpG sequences did not affect Th differentiation following DNA immunization, but they did enhance the IgG 2 a antibody response to coinoculated HA protein. Finally, cotransfection of IFNγ or IL- 4 expressing plasmids with an HA-expressing plasmid by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> inoculation or as a saline DNA injection did not shift the type of immune response in a Th 1 or Th 2 direction, respectively. Thus, it appeared that increased cytokine stimulation was not responsible for selective Th subset differentiation. One factor related to the method of DNA immunization did seem to correlate with Th 1 differentiation. Deposition of plasmid DNA extracellulary by saline DNA injections (as opposed to intracellular DNA delivery by <b>gene</b> <b>gun)</b> may have stimulated Th 1 immune responses. Manipulating a <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization to deliver DNA to the dermis (and thus extracellularly) shifted the immune response from that of a Th 2 type to a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 type. Furthermore, evidence was gathered demonstrating that pDNA can interact with cell surface molecules and that specific sequences in pDNA can act as a ligand and bind to molecules. Taken together, our data led us to propose a new model for Th 1 differentiation following saline DNA immunization. We believe extracellular pDNA binds to an APC cell surface molecule which activates the cell. The activated APC preferentially stimulates naive Th cells to differentiate into Th 1 cells. Finally, studies using a variety of mice differing in their genetic backgound and MHC genotype demonstrated the generality of our findings regarding i. m. saline DNA inoculations of an HA-expressing pDNA. Saline DNA immunization produced IgG 2 a, Th 1 -predominant immune responses independent of the genetic background and MHC genotype of the mice. In contrast, the type of immune response elicited by a <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization was dependent on the MHC genotype of mice. Thus the type of immune response produced by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA immunization probably depends on the specific antigen (and its effect on MHC-peptide/TcR interaction and signaling) and is less likely due to any inherent feature associated with the process of <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA delivery...|$|R

Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -encoding DNA was coated onto gold par-ticles (gold–DNA), dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (pure DNA), and prepared as a polymer adjuvant (jetPEI) –galactosidase solution (polymer–DNA). Murine liver transfection was attempted by nonviral ap-proaches, which included hydrodynamics-based transfection (HBT) of pure DNA, transport and transhepatic injection of polymer–DNA, and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> bombardment with pure DNA, gold–DNA, and polymer–DNA. Only HBT and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> bombardment yielded significant numbers of EGFP hepatocytes. With the exception of the edge of the liver, HBT had a whole-liver transfection rate of 20 % under optimized conditions. HBT re-sulted in marked hepatic infarctions, most prominently at the edge of the liver. For <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> bombardment, the transfection rate was pressure dependent and limited to 15 % for gold–DNA. Triple or quadruple bom-bardment at 30 psi resulted in a transfection rate comparable to that of a single bombardment at higher pres-sure, but was associated with minimal scattered hepatic necrosis. The EGFP hepatocytes were located mainly in the superficial layers. We conclude that both HBT and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> bombardment yielded efficient murine hepatocyte transfection in vivo. Severe hepatic infarction impedes foreign gene expression in the superficial hepatocytes after HBT.

40|$|Abstract We have {{successfully}} used the low-pressure BioWare <b>gene</b> <b>gun,</b> developed for <b>gene</b> transfer in animal cells, for plant tissues. The BioWare device {{is easy to}} manipulate. Just 50 psi helium pressure was sufficient to transfer foreign genes into the aleurone layer and embryo of maize without causing tissue damage in the impact area. As shown by expression signals from invasive histochem-ical b-glucuronidase (GUS) activity, the foreign reporter gene expressed well in bombarded tissues. This successful GUS-transient expression extends the application of this low-pressure <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> from animal cells to plant tissues...|$|R
25|$|The {{implosion}} method can {{use either}} uranium or plutonium as fuel. The <b>gun</b> <b>method</b> only uses uranium. Plutonium is considered impractical for the <b>gun</b> <b>method</b> because of early triggering due to plutonium-240 contamination {{and due to}} its time constant for prompt critical fission being much shorter than that of U-235.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Tyrosine kinase {{inhibitor}} gefitinib is effective against lung cancer cells carrying mutant {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR); however, it is not effective against lung cancer carrying normal EGFR. The breaking of immune tolerance against self epidermal growth factor receptor with active immunization may be a useful approach {{for the treatment of}} EGFR-positive lung tumors. Xenogeneic EGFR gene was demonstrated to induce antigen-specific immune response against EGFR-expressing tumor with intramuscular administration. Methods In order to enhance the therapeutic effect of xenogeneic EGFR DNA vaccine, the efficacy of altering routes of administration and formulation of plasmid DNA was evaluated on the mouse lung tumor (LL 2) naturally overexpressing endogenous EGFR in C 57 B 6 mice. Three different combination forms were studied, including (1) intramuscular administration of non-coating DNA vaccine, (2) <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> administration of DNA vaccine coated on gold particles, and (3) <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> administration of non-coating DNA vaccine. LL 2 -tumor bearing C 57 B 6 mice were immunized four times at weekly intervals with EGFR DNA vaccine. Results The results indicated that <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> administration of non-coating xenogenic EGFR DNA vaccine generated the strongest cytotoxicty T lymphocyte activity and best antitumor effects. CD 8 (+) T cells were essential for anti-tumor immunityas indicated by depletion of lymphocytes in vivo. Conclusion Thus, our data demonstrate that administration of non-coating xenogenic EGFR DNA vaccine by <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> may be the preferred method for treating EGFR-positive lung tumor in the future. </p...|$|R
