5|$|Between being {{commissioned}} in 1896 and {{the outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Massachusetts conducted training exercises off the eastern coast of the United States. During the war, she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Schley went searching for Cervera's Spanish squadron and found it in the port of Santiago. The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, because she had steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and Texas fired at the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor <b>entrance</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land {{earmarked}} for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's <b>entrance</b> <b>channel,</b> with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties.|$|E
50|$|The Spectacle Island Range Lights were a pair {{of range}} lights on Spectacle Island in Boston Harbor. They were {{established}} in 1897 and discontinued in 1913 after changes in the <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> to the harbor made them obsolete.|$|R
40|$|The {{excitation}} of the Dynamical Dipole mode {{along the}} fusion path was investigated {{for the first}} time in the formation of a heavy compound nucleus in the A~ 190 mass region. The compound nucleus was formed at identical conditions of excitation energy and spin from two <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> having different charge asymmetry: the charge asymmetric 40 Ca + 152 Sm and the nearly charge symmetric 48 Ca + 144 Sm at Elab= 11 and 10. 1 MeV/nucleon, respectively. Both fusion–evaporation and fission events were studied simultaneously {{for the first time}}.

40|$|Simulation models {{based on}} the {{elliptic}} mild or steep slope wave equation are frequently used to estimate wave properties needed for the engineering calculations of harbors. To increase the practical applicability of such models, a method is developed to include the effects of rubble mound structures that may be present {{along the sides of}} <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> into harbors. The results of this method are found to match those of other mathematical models (i. e. parabolic approximation & three-dimensional solution) under appropriate conditions, but they also deviate from results of parabolic approximations in some cases because dissipation can create angular scattering. Comparison with hydraulic model data also shows that this approach is useful for designing pocket wave absorbers that are used to reduce wave heights in <b>entrance</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{approach}} channel {{to the port}} has two sections—the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> within the protection of outer arm and the outer channel beyond the protection of outer arm. The total length of the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> is 7km. The width of channel gradually increased from 244m to 419m at the bent portion, then maintains a constant width of 305m. The depth of the inner and the outer channels are 18.6m and 19.2m, respectively, below chart datum, with a swell allowances of 3m. The entrance is 350m in Bharathi Dock and 125m in Dr. Ambedkar Dock. The draught in the navigational channel is maintained by dredging approximately 1 million cubic metres annually.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{historic}} and modern lighthouses {{in and around}} the port, some of which have been decommissioned. The port is the location of one of Chennai's earliest lighthouses—the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> tower. The 24m (79ft) tall tower with a focal plane of 26m (85ft), flashing white, red and green lights, is located north of the port. It is visible only from around the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel.</b> This tower is still active. However, the first lighthouse of the city is located just outside the port, in Fort St. George campus. It was active from 1796 till 1844. The second and third lighthouses are located in the Madras High Court campus near the port.|$|E

40|$|Access <b>channels</b> (<b>entrance</b> <b>channels)</b> to ports are a {{relevant}} part of port facilities, {{and they have}} a strong influence on the port operations as well. However, little information is available about their analysis and design regarding the wave interaction with access channels. This study is focused on the interaction of waves with <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> regarding wave propagation. This report has three parts: i) a qualitatively assessment of diffraction effects carried out with SWAN; ii) a comparison between SWAN (phase averaged wave model) and SWASH (phase resolving model) results, regarding refraction and diffraction effects; and ii) a systematic analysis of the results in SWAN on several wave conditions and a few access channel geometries (slopes). SWASH is used to test SWAN capabilities in an environment where significant refraction and diffraction is expected. The results of the comparison are analyzed and recommendations for future comparison are presented. The systematic analysis of conditions provides information about performance of SWAN and its ability to correctly represent physical phenomena particularly regarding refraction and diffraction. Additionally, recommendations for wave propagation analysis for <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> are presented. Finally, based on the results, engineering recommendations and considerations are presented regarding operations of ports and the design of related structures such as breakwaters.

25|$|With the {{acquisition}} of about 440 hectares of land, {{the first phase of}} the port consisted of the construction of a coal jetty, a wharf and an <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> and related dredging operations. The main construction work included two berths for handling coal vessels up to 65,000 DWT, dredging for the approach channel and harbour basin, onshore civil works, navigational aids, and two breakwaters—4km in the north side and 1km in the south—close to the NCTPS and the Ennore Creek. In 2014, the port was officially renamed as Kamarajar Port.|$|E
25|$|Situated on a coast that {{constitutes}} chiefly of sandy shelving breaker-swept beaches, the region surrounding the port falls under Seismic Zone III indicating a moderate risk of earthquake.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{clogging}} of a pleatedfilter in gasfiltration is presented. The model is obtained by combining a semi-analytical {{model of the}} flow in a pleatedfilter and an empirical model of clogging of the planar filter medium applied locally along the pleatedfilter channels.

Based on the numerical predictions, two main clogging scenarios are identified and analyzed. The optimum pleat density, defined as the pleat density maximizing the filter capacity, is determined and shown to be greater than the pleat density minimizing the pressure drop for a clean filter. Predictions of the evolution of overall pressure drop across the pleatedfilter due to clogging are compared with experimental data...|$|R

25|$|The {{hull of the}} {{icebreaker}} was assembled on a slipway {{and launched}} on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the <b>entrance</b> <b>channel</b> had to be dredged. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to {{the stern of the}} icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull. In the launching ceremony, the new icebreaker was given the name Moskva after the capital city. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and Moskva was delivered during the summer of 1960.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{chemical}} reactions {{in the gas}} phase can be decomposed into a network of elementary (e. g., unimolecular and bimolecular) steps which may involve multiple reactant channels, multiple intermediates, and multiple products. The modeling of such reactions involves describing the molecular species and their transformation by reaction at a detailed level. Here we focus on a detailed modeling of the C(P- 3) +allene (C 3 H 4) reaction, for which molecular beam experiments and theoretical calculations have previously been performed. In our previous calculations, product branching ratios for a nonrotating isomerizing unimolecular system were predicted. We extend the previous calculations to predict absolute unimolecular rate coefficients and branching ratios using microcanonical variational transition state theory (mu-VTST) with full energy and angular momentum resolution. Our calculation of the initial capture rate is facilitated by systematic ab initio potential energy surface calculations that describe the interaction potential between carbon and allene {{as a function of}} the angle of attack. Furthermore, the chemical kinetic scheme is enhanced to explicitly treat the <b>entrance</b> <b>channels</b> in terms of a predicted overall input flux and also to allow for the possibility of redissociation via the <b>entrance</b> <b>channels.</b> Thus, the computation of total bimolecular reaction rates and partial capture rates is now possible.
