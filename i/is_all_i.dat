5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have.|$|E
500|$|Shelley {{frequently}} laments {{the poor}} education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt. She {{does not think}} much of the Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister Claire Clairmont, [...] "I do dislike the Germans—& never wish to visit Germany again—but I would not put this in print—for the surface <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> know." [...] Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, {{except to say that}} she was impressed by their public education system.|$|E

500|$|The Boston Herald noted {{superficial}} {{similarities between}} System Shock and Doom, but called System Shock [...] "much more elaborate". The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls; of the latter, he said, [...] "There's {{no way you}} can play System Shock without first studying the manual for at least 20 minutes". The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game [...] "is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but good to the last byte". The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can find to complain about. Graphics and sound are outstanding, and the game is well-paced and riveting".|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
500|$|Blunt's third studio album titled Some Kind of Trouble, was {{released}} on 8 November 2010. The album debuted at number four in the UK with over 100,000 copies sold in the first week. The album's first single [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was released}} on 27 October 2010. The single did much better in Europe than the UK, sitting at number two on the European Airplay Chart for five consecutive weeks, but only charting at number 37 in the UK top 40. The second single from the album, [...] "So Far Gone" [...] was released in the UK on 3 January 2011. The third single from the album, [...] "If Time <b>Is</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Have" [...] was released in the UK on 4 April 2011. Overall critical reception has been mixed, with Allmusic saying, in a positive review, that [...] "Some Kind of Trouble {{is a step in}} the right direction for Blunt, a move toward love songs free of pretension" [...] whilst BBC Music felt [...] "When all's said, Some Kind of Trouble is not a terrible record by any means, but there's little sense that Blunt has advanced, and equally little sense that it'll make any difference to his bottom line." ...|$|E

500|$|Shepherd {{was briefly}} {{involved}} with Beasts of Bourbon alongside fellow Guru, James Baker. He recorded their four-track CD, From the Belly of the Beasts in live 1984 {{performance at the}} Trade Union Club, Sydney. Shepherd's tenure with Beasts ended after Baker was sacked from the Gurus. He joined another ex-Guru, Roddy Radalj, in Roddy Ray'Da and the Surfin' Caesars during 1989. In 1999, following Gurus break-up, Shepherd recorded [...] "Alex Chilton" [...] for The Replacements tribute album, I'm in Love... With That Song (Antfarm Records). [...] He also produced Shutterspeed's debut 1999 EP, Up Go The Shutters and co-produced their second EP, Well Ain't That Something A Good Thing's Comin' [...] on Laughing Outlaw Records. Shepherd went on {{to form a new}} band, The Monarchs (initially known as The Honkies), together with Andy Kelly on bass (Glide), Greg Hitchcock on guitar (The Neptunes, The Kryptonics, New Christs, The Verys, Challenger 7, You Am I, The Dearhunters) and his brother Murray Shepherd (Harpoon, The Fun Things, Screaming Tribesmen) on drums. [...] The Monarchs played with The Meanies, Even, You Am I, Joe Strummer and The Hellacopters. [...] In August 1999 The Monarchs recorded a self-financed album with Wayne Connolly and in 2000 they released their first single, [...] "2001" [...] b/w [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Can Do" [...] (Ivy League Records); this was followed by their debut album, Make Yer Own Fun, in October 2001, on Shock Records.|$|E
500|$|... "Devil in a New Dress" [...] {{is built}} on a sample of Smokey Robinson's [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". Its lyrics are about lust and heartache, with sexual and {{religious}} imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". It is the only track without production by West but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples. [...] "Runaway" [...] features a piano-based motif comprising a series of sustained descending half and whole notes, with a coda that incorporates light strings and vocoder-singing by West. The narrator's self-critical lyrics reflect on his personality and character flaws. Sean Fennessey cites the song as {{the point in the}} album in which [...] "self-laceration overtakes chest-beating", noting West's sung-line [...] "I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most". Inspired by his two-year relationship with model Amber Rose, [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] contains a psychedelic rock sample and a narrative about marrying a porn star. According to critic Ryan Dombal, the song [...] "attempts to bend its central credo— 'no more drugs for me, pussy and religion <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> need'— into a noble pursuit ... The song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song". [...] "Blame Game" [...] is a low-key track about a painful domestic dispute. It features piano by producer Mike Dean, additional vocals by John Legend, and a profane skit by comedian Chris Rock.|$|E

2500|$|After {{starting}} qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 {{well with}} two wins, England hit a poor run of form between October 2006 and March 2007 {{with only one}} goal scored in five matches, by which time they had fallen to fourth in their qualification group. During a match against Andorra in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win.
