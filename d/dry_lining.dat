5000|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> {{typically}} advances eastward {{during the}} afternoon and retreats westward at night, mainly due to the increased mixing down {{to the surface of}} moist air aloft, rather than the air mass' surface density contrast. The movement of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> during daylight hours is quickest in areas where low level moisture is most shallow, as dryline movement slows in areas with deeper low-level moisture. Weaker winds aloft also slow its progression. [...] However, a strong storm system can sweep the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> eastward into the Mississippi Valley or Texas/Louisiana border, regardless of the time of day. Stronger <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> passages result in a sharp drop in dew point, clearing skies, and a wind shift from south or south-easterly to west or south-westerly. Blowing dust and rising temperatures also may follow, especially if the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> passes during the daytime. These changes occur in reverse order when the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> retreats westward during the evening and nighttime hours. Severe and sometimes tornadic thunderstorms often develop along the slope-reversal zone east of the surface <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> especially when it begins moving eastward.|$|R
500|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> {{may occur}} {{anywhere}} on earth in regions intermediate between desert areas and warm seas.

[...] A <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> is depicted on National Weather Service (NWS) surface analyses as an orange line with scallops facing into the moist sector. <b>Dry</b> <b>lines</b> {{are one of the few}} surface fronts where the pips indicated do not necessarily reflect the direction of motion.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{from the}} Oklahoma Mesonet and high {{resolution}} Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations {{were used to}} evaluate the effect that the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> and large-scale atmospheric patterns had on drought evolution during 2011. Mesonet observations showed that a “dry” and “wet” pattern developed across Oklahoma due to anomalous atmospheric patterns. The location of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> varied due to this “dry” and “wet” pattern, with the average <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> location around 1. 5 ° longitude further to the east than climatology. Model simulations were used to further quantify the impact of variable surface conditions on <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> evolution and convective initiation (CI) during April and May 2011. Specifically, soil moisture conditions were altered to depict “wet” and “dry” conditions across the domain by replacing the soil moisture values by each soil category’s porosity or wilting point value. Overall, the strength of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> boundary, its position, and subsequent CI were dependent on the modification of soil moisture. The simulations demonstrated that modifying soil moisture impacted the nature of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> and showed that soil moisture conditions {{during the first half of}} the warm season modified the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> pattern and influenced the evolution and perpetuation of drought over Oklahoma...|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of May 22, 1981, winds moving in from the south brought moist air across Texas and into western Oklahoma and <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> formed across the Texas panhandle. In addition, the {{interaction}} between a layer of warm air aloft and the return flow of moist air led to widespread low clouds across the state of Oklahoma. Later that day, the low clouds broke as predicted by forecasters as the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> moved east into western Oklahoma. However, the clearing was limited to a relatively narrow zone ahead of the <b>dry</b> <b>line.</b> Despite this, daytime heating allowed thunderstorms to form by mid-afternoon.|$|R

5|$|The {{next day}} a <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> which {{separates}} the drier {{air from the}} more moist and humid air, formed ahead of the cold front across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and tracked eastward. The high humidity levels with dew points in the 70s°F (low 20s°C), temperatures that in many areas were near 80°F (27°C), strong wind shear {{and the presence of}} the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> helped develop the instability to produce severe thunderstorms across the Midwest and Southern Plains on October 17.|$|R
5000|$|In the dry sector {{west of the}} <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> {{clear skies}} are the rule due to the dryness of the air mass {{sweeping}} off the Rocky Mountains in North America, and the Aravalli range in India. [...] If winds are strong enough, dust storms can develop. [...] Cumulus clouds are common east of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> in the moist sector, though they are taller with greater development along the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> itself. [...] The moist sector is normally capped with a lid of an elevated mixed drier layer which represents subsidence from aloft as the surface air cools and contracts at night. The same process promotes {{the development of a}} low level jet to the east of the dryline. During the daytime, if heating and/or convergence are sufficient, the cap can be broken, resulting in convective clouds.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> (also called [...] a {{dew point}} line, or Marfa front, after Marfa, Texas) is an {{imaginary}} line across a continent that separates moist air from an eastern {{body of water}} and dry desert air from the west. One {{of the most prominent}} examples of such a separation occurs in central North America, especially Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, where the moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets dry air from the desert south-western states. The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> {{is an important factor in}} severe weather frequency in the Great Plains of North America. It typically lies north-south across the High Plains states in the warm sector of an extratropical cyclone and stretches into the Canadian Prairies during the spring and early summer. The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> is also important for severe convective storms in other regions of the world, such as northern India.|$|R

500|$|During {{daylight}} hours, drier {{air from}} aloft drifts {{down to the}} surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward. At night, the boundary reverts to the west {{as there is no}} longer any solar heating to help mix the lower atmosphere. If enough moisture converges upon the dryline, [...] it can be the focus of afternoon and evening thunderstorms. A <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> is depicted on United States surface analyses as a brown line with scallops, or bumps, facing into the moist sector. <b>Dry</b> <b>lines</b> are one of the few surface fronts where the special shapes along the drawn boundary do not necessarily reflect the boundary's direction of motion.|$|R

40|$|Summary There {{have been}} recent reports of {{interstitial}} condensation forming {{on the back}} of vapour checks of <b>dry</b> <b>lined</b> solid walls. This usually occurred within south facing walls during hot weather. A possible explanation is that water evaporates from the inside surface of the masonry, travels through the insulation and condenses on the cooler internal vapour check. Similar condensation has been reproduced in experimental walls under natural weather conditions with a variety of insulants including highly permeable mineral fibre. In these tests it was found that condensation deposited over a period of a few hours can take several days to re-evapora te. Summer condensation within <b>dry</b> <b>lined</b> solid walls J. R.

5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather, as a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|R
50|$|As the day progressed, {{the surface}} low ejected through Nebraska, with a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> and {{trailing}} cold front.

One {{of the worst}} dust storms on record occurred behind the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> in western Kansas, but in the warm sector the day remained dry until mid afternoon when light showers began to form in central Nebraska. A cooperative observer in Osceola noted that the wind shifted from S to NW at 2230Z (4:30 PM local). Professors at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln noted that the relative humidity there jumped from 53% at 2150Z to 78% at 2230Z, indicating much higher dewpoints had rapidly arrived in Lincoln since the cold front was still to the west near Osceola.
