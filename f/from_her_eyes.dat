5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{has several}} superhuman abilities, {{including}} immense physical strength, {{the ability to}} leap large distances, and to project some type of mystical energy from her body, often <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Her invulnerability is tied to her level of concentration, and she can be harmed if extremely fatigued or distracted. She has also stated {{that she has a}} superhuman sense of direction. Since being cast down, she cannot touch Earth's soil, and so floats just above the ground when barefoot. Because of the nature of time in Bete Noire, Lee, who was not born in the city, ages more slowly than Bete Noire native-borns, but has yet experienced some aging {{between the first and second}} volumes of the series because she spends half her time outside the city. When in the city, she physically appears to be the equivalent of a twenty-five-year-old human woman, but outside the city, appears to be a woman in her late 40's.|$|E
500|$|During the {{intermediate}} break, {{one of the}} male models is shown nude and wearing a crown of thorns on his head, while Madonna gets caressed by the others. The final sequence of the video shows the singer dancing energetically with Kazaky, with the fog machine and the male models who grind against each other. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ends with Madonna dropping the fog machine and a final scene showing the singer's face with black colored tears pouring <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Caroline {{shook her}} head gently. A soft, {{expressive}} ray <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> beamed on the real Robert. It said much.|$|R
60|$|Rowland's countenance fell. He frowned in silence. Cecilia {{looked at}} him askance; {{gradually}} the spark of irritation faded <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|He saw her stagger to her feet, {{holding the}} baby at arm's length <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> glued in horror upon the little chubby face and {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
500|$|A key {{passage in}} the novel details {{what happens when a}} vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that {{traditional}} vampire lore usually prohibits. Alfredson originally wanted to omit this from the film, but Ajvide Lindqvist was adamant {{that it had to be}} included. Alfredson was initially nervous about the scene. He realized in post-production that the sound effects and music made it [...] "American, in a bad way", and had to be removed for the scene to work. The end result, which shows Eli slowly beginning to bleed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> ears, and pores, received positive notices from many critics. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as a [...] "haemophilia of rejection".|$|E
500|$|Other scenes show Rihanna {{dancing around}} the piano while the pianist is still playing. While her boyfriend is sleeping, Rihanna sends {{a text message}} to her lover, [...] "B down in 5". She walks {{down the street and}} gets into a car with her lover, who is the note-writing diner from the {{restaurant}} and the man who plays the piano at the rehearsal. As the song continues, Rihanna is shown regretfully embracing her lover near the piano. When the rehearsal finishes, she leaves the arena, where her boyfriend is waiting for her with his car. Rihanna hugs him and tears fall <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> A reviewer from MTV Australia wrote about the video's theme and appearance, [...] "Cheaters always get busted. And this time around, Rihanna sings about being the one doing the two-timing. Secret notes, sneaking around, hearts broken... Oh, the drama. And she looks gooooood." ...|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges in her stomach, as if {{something}} {{is trying to get}} out. Harrison then begins to bleed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Doggett approaches Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, he is able to fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why was it necessary?" [...] said Dolly, with sparks flying <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "Throughout <b>from</b> the {{beginning}} {{he has been}} bad. Why was the woman not his wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{long since}} he laid {{down there to}} die, Mr. Gibbs?" [...] asked Sarah, as she took the glass <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "He looks as natural {{as if he was}} asleep." ...|$|R
60|$|Here all the sarcasm passed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> voice, the {{defiance}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> {{and the one}} unspoiled attribute {{which still}} lingered in this woman's artful nature shone in her face, as she turned toward Edward and Bella at their mother's side.|$|R
2500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Jesse Davey, depicts the band playing {{in front of}} a young woman, the [...] "Hollywood Whore" [...] that the song is referring to. Eventually, the woman arises and blood is seen falling <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The skin and muscle on her face deteriorates and turns to that of a bloody skull, and blood begins to explode out of her mouth, completely drenching the band as they are performing.|$|E
2500|$|Rob {{listens to}} a phone message from Beth, saying she is trapped in her {{apartment}} at the Time Warner Center and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena (another party guest, on whom Hud has a crush) venture into Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. By 3:17 am, they get caught in a battle between the creature and the National Guard and run into the Spring Street station, where they are attacked by several of the parasitic creatures inside the subway tunnel. Marlena is bitten by one of them. Exiting the subway via the 59th Street station, the four come to a command center and field hospital, where Marlena develops {{a reaction to the}} bite, which causes her to bleed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Medics drag Marlena into a tent where it appears that she explodes. One of the military leaders tells the remaining members of the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its [...] "Hammer Down Protocol," [...] which will destroy Manhattan in an attempt to kill the monster.|$|E
2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12â€“14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
6000|$|A tear, one of Marian's very {{reluctant}} tears, actually rushed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> {{and with a}} hard struggle to speak, she said, [...] "Miserable! {{how can you say}} so? You are so very kind to me." ...|$|R
50|$|Like her mother, Nightstar {{is capable}} of {{atmospheric}} flight, has super-strength, and can fire starbolts <b>from</b> <b>her</b> hands. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> are green and pupilless.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} {{leaned across}} the table. The cloud had passed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> features, the dull weight <b>from</b> <b>her</b> heart. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were more eloquent even than her tremulous lips.|$|R
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, I mean no such thing," [...] said Mary, with a flash <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{that made}} Frank almost start. [...] "I mean no such thing. I mean you, not your mother. I {{am not in}} the least afraid of Lady Arabella; but I am afraid of you." ...|$|R
60|$|Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped <b>from</b> <b>her</b> downcast <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|She drew {{a little}} away <b>from</b> me. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were still fixed eagerly upon my face.|$|R
60|$|Columbine {{swept her}} hand <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{with a gesture}} of utter surrender.|$|E
60|$|Lov. Pr'ythee, good magistrate, {{drink to}} her, and wipe sorrow <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lady Bothwell {{rose and}} went to the window, the tears gushing <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{treated him}} {{to one of}} her sudden vagaries. All the discontent seemed to fade in a moment <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> laughed into his, her mouth {{softened}} into a most attractive curve.|$|R
60|$|Her face lighted. A sunny smile broke on me <b>from</b> <b>her</b> heavenly <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|And now Gudruda sobs and {{the tears}} fall fast <b>from</b> <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{was greatly}} distressed and had {{hard work to}} keep the tears <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

60|$|Urmston made {{a gesture}} of protest, but she silenced him with a flash <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|He met {{a glance}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes,</b> and his pale cheeks were {{suddenly}} flushed.|$|R
60|$|He gave a shove {{against the}} yacht's side and glided away <b>from</b> under <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> A {{rippling}} sound died out.|$|R
60|$|Molly, gazing {{over the}} side of the boat into the lake, abstained <b>from</b> feasting <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the picturesque spectacle.|$|R
