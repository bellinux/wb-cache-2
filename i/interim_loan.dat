In the U.S., it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an <b>interim</b> <b>loan</b> (the [...] "construction loan") to build a building.

Riggs Bank, a local D.C. bank, had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif. The New York City Employees Retirement System was to have paid off this construction loan. That payment was halted when the loan officer Nassif had dealt with was indicted for taking bribes to approve loans. When the pension fund refused to provide the loan, Riggs Bank sued for payment and threatened to foreclose on the Nassif Building.|$|E

50|$|One recent {{point of}} major {{contention}} in the borough {{has been a}} 240 acre swath of reclaimed coal-mining land south of Commerce Boulevard that was deeded to the borough for public use after the state government cleaned it up. Plans to build a bond-financed municipal golf course on the land launched during the early 2000s were scuttled after some borough council members campaigned against that form of borrowing and won the majority of seats. The land was seized by a local bank after <b>interim</b> <b>loans</b> went unpaid, but because the state stipulated {{that it has to}} remain {{in the hands of a}} municipality, neighboring borough Dunmore snapped it up.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of Swedish blogs as a channel for {{introduction}} and establishment of English loans. The direct loans, covering both single-word loans and phrasal loans, were collected from nine blogs at three points in time: 2000, 2004 and 2008. The dimensions of frequency, distribution, formal integration and establishment in Swedish normative dictionaries were {{used to analyze the}} samples as unintegrated, <b>interim</b> or established <b>loans</b> in accordance with Chrystal (1988). A newspaper corpus was used to compare the borrowings’ time of appearance to see whether the blogs have {{a more active role in}} introducing borrowings than newspapers have.      Of the single-word loans accounted for, 24 were unintegrated, 19 interim and 5 established. The phrasal loans showed 27 unintegrated, 30 interim and 1 established borrowing. When compared to the newspaper corpus, 10 single-word loans and 32 phrasal loans occurred only in blogs or in blogs before they occurred in the corpus, while 38 single-word loans and 26 phrases occurred in the corpus before or at the same time as in the blogs. Nine of the unintegrated or <b>interim</b> <b>loans</b> in the blogs were subsequently established in a Swedish dictionary. The results indicate that blogs do have a role in introducing and establishing borrowings in Swedish, but from this qualitative investigation it is not possible to determine the magnitude of their influence...|$|R

Italy and Greece were obviously different with regard to population and market size, but the outcome of the foreign aid they received, differed in the two countries. This paper suggests that the different outcome is explained by historical legacies and conjunctures, as well as series of institutional, cultural, and political factors. Greece underwent a disastrous Nazi occupation (1941 - 44) and the destructive Civil War (1946 - 49) of which Italy was spared. The Italian public sector was endowed with state agencies steering economic development, which the Greek public sector lacked until the early 1950 s. Italian elections resulted in more stable governments, led by the Christian Democratic Party, which followed their own policy choices, often deviating from the donors' policy preference. This was a pattern absent from the long sequence of unstable and internally fragmented Greek governments. The Italian governing elites relied on a social alliance of middle and upper classes, while in Greece the corresponding classes distrusted the government, and resisted government policies. Finally, an economic culture fostering heavy industrialization, in the context of pragmatist liberal economic policies, was present in Italy, but absent in Greece...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} multi-period general {{equilibrium}} model of bank deposit, credit, and <b>interim</b> interbank <b>loan</b> markets in which banks initially specialize in their choices of debtors, leading to underdiversi cation, but nevertheless become entwined via inter-bank markets, leading to the fortunes of one bank affecting the pro ts and default rates of {{the other in a}} sequential manner. Lack of (full) diversi cation among credit risks arises in our model owing to a relative pro t argument in each banker's utility function, which is otherwise risk- and default-averse. We examine its implications for the welfare of depositors and debtors. The rst version of this paper appeared in 2003. We are grateful to seminar participants at the 7 th Conference of the Society for the Advancememt of Economic Theory...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} bankruptcy law. Property right are reassigned in this court administered process and preexisting contracts only partially enforced. Bankruptcy 2 ̆ 7 s direct and indirect costs are examined. Simply stated, the dissertation concerns the estate 2 ̆ 7 s division among competing claimants, and how this process effects its size. It seeks to explain the typical outcome of deviations from the absolute priority rule (APR) whereas lower priority claimants, such as insolvent equity, retain value in reorganized firms while senior debts emerge impaired. ^ Deadweight losses and deviations from the APR are explained by equity 2 ̆ 7 s ownership of an implicit call option over firm assets. Equity rationally chooses real investments to maximize option value {{as opposed to the}} estate. This may entail selecting risky investments skewing the investment realization distribution during reorganization. The option is traded to creditors via the plan of reorganization. Agency costs result from inefficient real overinvestment as equity maximizes what is extracted from the estate and preexisting creditors. The legislatively mandated seniority of new <b>interim</b> <b>loans</b> over preexisting creditors exacerbates real overinvestment. ^ Legislatively imposed default rules form inalienable constraints preventing more efficient outcomes. Efforts claimed to 2 ̆ 2 help 2 ̆ 2 debtors ironically create a credit crunch. Bankruptcy law fosters transfer seeking by debtors, creditors, and lawyers, in a negative sum game. Contracting adapts around implicit convenants emplaced into debt contracts by bankruptcy, law, e. g. higher interest rates and loan qualification requirements, leasing as a substitute for secured debt. Property rights pending in the Bankruptcy Court system (1996) are approximately 310 billion. ^ A chronological history of bankruptcy 2 ̆ 7 s statutory development is included. Coverage begins with Roman law, but focuses on legal transformations occurring in England and the United States. Most enactments occurred during severe economic downturns as politically endowed debtor to creditor transfers. Bankruptcy was diametrically transformed from a crime punishable by death into a debtor benefit. Repeatedly, benefits were broadened and eligibility widened. ^ Increasing benefits, the foremost being the ability to legally discharge debts without payment through the court procedure, stimulated usage. Annual filings increased six-fold since the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act with 1. 18 million bankruptcies (1 per 86 households) during 1996, twenty times the rate during the Great Depression. ...|$|R
