Parsing and indexing are not used in the Text Analyzer. The Text Analyzer can be connected to CODE 4, a knowledge management system, so that a knowledge base can be constructed as knowledge is found in the text.

The study focuses on the document production and distribution methods before and after layoffs in the mid- 1990 s. The company at its peak employed a many <b>document</b> <b>specialists,</b> but by mid- 1995, none of those positions existed at the company, and the company planned to employ electronic publishing. The dissertation outlines the history of document production and distribution from 1970 – 1997 and analyzes the company 2 ̆ 7 s decision to distribute its documents electronically. A survey of customers revealed their capabilities and preferences for receiving documents. The company-customer culture is largely viewed through the theoretical lens of Feenberg 2 ̆ 7 s critical theory of technology. I show how the company took an instrumentalist view of the technology. In doing so, the company ignored the culture and literacy level of its customers. Had the company espoused a critical theory of technology, the result {{might have been more}} positive for the company and for the customers. I also examine the decision-making process and failure to implement an electronic publishing system from a literacy standpoint, looking at how those in power to make the electronic publishing decisions had a very low level of literacy in that area.

Using a homogeneous database of the population at a municipal level – elaborated from the eleven censuses carried out between 1900 and 2001 – the paper looks at the general characteristics of population concentration from various perspectives. Focusing on population density, we present empirical evidence that supports the hypothesis that, over time, Spain’s population has undergone progressive concentration, a process that has not finished in the present days. Its main contribution is to offer quantitative support for phenomena which have already been well <b>documented</b> by <b>specialists</b> in more general terms. ...|$|R

In sharp contrast to previous research which focuses on specialist markets, quoted depth is lowest at the open of trading, plateaus around the middle of the day, and then dramatically increases in the final hours of trading, peaking at the close. This peak in quoted depth coincides with a narrowing in bid-ask spreads, and is contrary to intraday patterns <b>documented</b> for <b>specialist</b> markets. We conclude that the increase in depth and narrowing of bid-ask spreads at the close is driven by dealers rebalancing inventories to achieve target inventory levels in a competitive market. 2 1...|$|R

Whilst nicorandil-induced oral and anal ulceration is well documented in the literature, nicorandil-induced fistulation is not. This is the first report {{in the literature of}} a single patient demonstrating simultaneous orocutaneous and anal fistulae during nicorandil therapy. Two separate cases of orocutaneous and anal fistulae associated nicorandil usage have previously been <b>documented</b> in <b>specialist</b> journals. Case presentation A 71 -year-old Caucasian man presented with a 3 -year history of concurrent orocutaneous and anal fistulae. He had been exposed to 30 mg twice-daily nicorandil therapy for 4 years. Both fistulae responded poorly to intensive and prolonged conventional treatment but healed promptly on reduction and eventual withdrawal of nicorandil therapy. Conclusion Management of resistant cases of orocutaneous and anal fistulae in patients on high-dose nicorandil therapy may be impossible without reduction or even withdrawal of nicorandil. </p...|$|R

By exploring a range of artefacts, photographs and archival documents that have survived, or emerged from, these transformations, this volume sheds an oblique light on the histories of British Missionaries in Africa and the Pacific, and the ways in which their work is remembered in different parts of the world today. Short contributions describing the histories of particular items, accompanied by rich visual imagery, showcase the extraordinary items that were caught up in histories of conversion, and are still controversial for many today. By focusing on the varied forms of missionary heritage, this volume aims to question the often used categories of trophies, relics or curios, and highlight the complexity involved in the missionary encounter.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{historical}} texts {{are available in}} machine-readable form, which retain the original spelling, which can {{be very different from}} the modern-day equivalents due to the natural evolution of a language, and because the concept of standardisation in spelling is comparatively modern.

Thus, we do not know,a priori, how many variant forms of a particular word there are in such texts, let alone what these variants might be.

Racial segregation in both countries, Cell argues, was not primarily an outgrowth of their slave or frontier or agricultural histories. Rather, their self-conscious, formalized systems of discriminatory racial separation crystallized relatively suddenly after 1890 in the United States and after 1905 in South Africa; flourished in the "modern" urban and industrial, rather than the "traditional" agrarian, sector of society; were imposed by political, not social or economic, means; represented responses to political or economic threats or potential threats by persons of color, rather than mere legalizations of their already deprived socioeconomic status; and were fostered largely by white moderates, not extremists...|$|R

In this work various prediction methods, namely statistical regressions, system identification and RANSE, have been investigated in order to evaluate twin screw naval vessels manoeuvrability behaviour. From this analysis stern appendages influence (including also non linear effects resulting from hull-appendages interactions) resulted one of the peculiar characteristics of this type of ships, clearly affecting their manoeuvring capabilities...|$|R
