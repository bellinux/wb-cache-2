25|$|Since the Crown {{never had}} much of a case against Megrahi, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found prima facie {{evidence}} in June 2007 that Megrahi had suffered a miscarriage of justice and recommended that he be granted a second appeal.|$|E
25|$|While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> {{that the}} ABC {{did not make}} an {{immediate}} announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both {{moved on to other}} projects.|$|E

In his first two seasons in New Zealand, he scored 1234 runs at 38.56 and took 42 wickets at 26.69, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that he was called up to the Test team.|$|E

He took five wickets in an innings ten times, {{including}} an analysis of 13.2-9-6-5 against Kent. With this record, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> when he was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The season {{started off}} in Brazil {{and all the}} native fans were {{supporting}} Senna. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that Senna took pole ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Hill, Frentzen and Gianni Morbidelli. At the start, Alesi took second from Schumacher while Wendlinger and Verstappen, who was driving in place of Lehto who had suffered a neck injury in testing, got ahead of Frentzen and Morbidelli. At the end of lap 1 Senna was leading Alesi, Schumacher, Hill, Wendlinger and Verstappen.|$|E
25|$|Led by Local President, Rosemary DiMaggio and Chief Steward Rose Greenup, {{the members}} of California School Employees Association (CSEA) Chapter 44 walked out when {{negotiations}} for a new contract broke down. The previous year, their counterparts in Chapter #85, at neighbouring Antioch School District had gone out for 9 days, and tensions had been brewing in Pittsburg for some time, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> when the bus drivers, custodians, teacher’s aides, food service workers, clerical staff and library assistants hit the bricks.|$|E

25|$|Always {{more of an}} {{establishment}} figure than any sort of rebel, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> when Stewart was asked to captain England in 1998 when Mike Atherton resigned. Despite being the age of 35 at the time, Stewart's level of fitness was impeccable, especially bearing in mind that most players do not continue beyond 37. As it was Stewart went on to play for England beyond his 40th birthday – but as events were to transpire – his captaincy of England barely lasted 12 months.|$|E
25|$|His {{popularity}} {{peaked in}} the 1980s. Magnetic Band constantly toured the Soviet Union. In 1982, Washington Post dedicated a whole page to Gunnar Graps and the Magnetic Band. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that in 1983 Magnetic Band got {{banned by the}} Soviet authorities, which led to creation of GGG (Gunnar Graps Group). The change also marked a shift towards straightforward hard rock and heavy metal, genres which Magnetic Band were already flirting with (Note: all the musical groups in Soviet Union had to be evaluated before {{they were allowed to}} perform or exist at all).|$|E
25|$|With the disappointing {{second half}} of the season, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that DC United didn't take home any pos-season awards, in {{contrast}} to the 2014 season. Bill Hamid finished 3rd in voting for Goalkeeper of the Year, despite finishing first in voting among MLS club management. Although his save percentage made him the league leader, presumably the amount of time he missed for injuries played a factor in the voting, The team went into the offseason with a plan to keep the core together, announcing new deals for Saborio, Rolfe, Boswell and DeLeon, while discussions continued with Kitchen.|$|E

25|$|Remarkably, {{when the}} sizzling, dry weather returned, Warwickshire, with Foster and Frank Field making {{unrivalled}} use of extremely fast wickets, won match after match – only {{stopped by a}} few draws due to heavy scoring – to claim the Championship. In this period, Foster scored 200 against Surrey and 105 in an hour against Yorkshire, and achieved such bowling feats as 11 for 73 at Northampton in the final match. For the whole season, Foster headed both batting and bowling averages for his county, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> {{when he went to}} Australia for the 1911/1912 Ashes tour.|$|E
25|$|The League Cup (Liverpool's third {{successive}} {{triumph in}} this competition) was added through a 2–1 win over bitter rivals Manchester United after extra time at Wembley.

25|$|Just {{two days}} later, 20 September, Board {{lined up for}} Great Britain in the 4 × 400 m relay. Running the last leg, she came from ten metres down {{entering}} the home straight to beat her old rival Besson, who was anchoring the French squad, in a dramatic photo finish, not only winning gold for Britain but also helping to set a new world record of 3:30.8. Having claimed two gold medals, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that she was named as 'Best Woman Athlete in the Games'. The relay team, featuring Board, Rosemary Stirling, Pat Lowe and Janet Simpson, was the first British team to win that title at the competition.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} years of the CCP, Xiang was not alone as a {{representative}} of the proletariat. In the 6th National Congress, the Central Committee elected 22 members from workers, 14 of which defected to the KMT later. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that after Xiang’s arrest and execution, another member of politburo, Lu Futan (Chinese: 卢福坦) who also came from the working class, expressed his wish to succeed Xiang as General Secretary. The Comintern rejected the proposal and chose students such as Wang Ming and Bo Gu, who had studied in the Soviet Union. They were seen as more trustworthy to take the leadership of the CCP, although they had no experience compared to the worker activists.|$|E
25|$|Rakitić {{was born}} in Möhlin in the Swiss canton of Aargau to a Croatian family of Šokci origin. His father, Luka, {{and his family are}} {{originally}} from Sikirevci, while his mother's family are Bosnian Croats from Žepče. He has a brother, Dejan; Rakitić has a tattoo bearing his brother's name on his right arm. Rakitić spent his childhood and early career in Switzerland. His father and older brother were also footballers. With such a background, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> when Rakitić took a strong interest in the same aspirations, even as he was completing his primary school studies. Subsequent to doing so, he began to concentrate on his sporting career, with his family's encouragement. At age 16, he was noticed by top European scouts who acclaimed his young potential, although he and his family decided to stay in Basel to allow him to play more regularly in a smaller league instead.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly") Rush, La Sombra, La Máscara and Marco Corleone had claimed to be tecnicos diferentes, or {{a different kind of}} good guys, which meant that they did not get along with other tecnico wrestlers but generally fought against rudos. For the Sin Salida show {{that was not the case}} Rush, La Sombra and Marco Corleone faced the tecnico team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. and Los Ingobernables clearly played the rudo part of the match, cheating whenever they had a chance including pulling Diamante Azul's mask off at one point and tearing Atlantis' mask apart. With Volador Jr. and La Sombra being bitter rivals for years <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the two did not fight a clean match but both Rush and Corleone used underhanded tactics to win the match including a low kick to Volador Jr. to win the third and deciding fall. After the match Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to put his mask on the line against Volador Jr.'s hair, a challenge turned down by La Sombra as he had already unmasked Volador Jr. Moments later Diamante Azul upped the challenge, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. against La Sombra and Rush and Azul would put his mask on the line as well. The challenge was not accepted, nor declined by Los Ingorbernables at the time.|$|E
50|$|Sporting {{activities}} are increasingly popular in Quebec. As Quebec is snow-bound {{for several months}} of the year, typically from November to March, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that many winter activities have taken root and, in a few cases, even originated here.|$|R
5000|$|In episode 12 {{the group}} discuss {{the fact that}} many Amish {{teenagers}} will sneak out and dress 'English', and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> to find pictures of them, or many other teenage Amish, during excursions outside of the community.|$|R

500|$|T. : The FA Cup was contested in 1945–46, but the Football League proper did not resume {{until the}} {{following}} season. However, 1945–46 did see the only full season played in the wartime Football League North and South [...] regionalised competition; this included First and Second Division clubs divided geographically, playing each other home and away. The club {{were able to take}} part despite the city of Plymouth in ruins, but they often struggled to assemble 11 fit players on a Saturday, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that they managed just three wins from 42 matches. In all, 72 players represented the club that season.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{regrouping}} in {{the sector}} {{ran into the}} rasputitsa, which turned much of the soil into mud. This caused severe delays in the preparations and made reinforcing the Southern and Southwestern Front take longer than expected. Senior Soviet representatives criticized the front commanders for poor management of forces, an inability to stage offensives and for their armchair generalship. Because the regrouping was done so haphazardly, the Germans received some warning of Soviet preparations. Moskalenko, {{the commander of the}} 38th Army, placed the blame {{on the fact that the}} fronts did not plan in advance to regroup and showed a poor display of front management. (He commented afterwards that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the [...] "German-Fascist command divined our plans".) ...|$|E

In 2014, romance novelist Madeline Hunter recalled Lord of Scoundrels being [...] "the 'must read' of the season" [...] when {{it was published in}} 1995, and described it as [...] "witty, heartfelt, with a flawed hero and an indomitable heroine, [...] pacing so perfect a reader could only hold on for the ride. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that a book that pushed so many peoples' happy buttons ended up winning a RITA that year.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines female's roles {{within the}} illicit economy. It also examines the perceptions that are held of women within this economy. Media influences have obviously affected perceptions that are held; however, {{many of the}} perceptions do not reflect reality. This {{has resulted in a}} false representation of crime and the illicit economy; and therefore false perceptions being held. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> therefore <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that women <b>are</b> still seen as a taboo when involved within the illicit economy, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that men <b>are</b> still seen to have the dominant role within it...|$|R
50|$|Given {{the long}} history of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the {{military}} band tradition is a mix of the French and US military band practice.
