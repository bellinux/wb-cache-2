60|$|The stubbornness {{vanished}} from Tom's face, and there came instead a dazed expression as he thrust a great, <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> into the Major's.|$|E
60|$|<b>Harding</b> <b>handed</b> him a check, and Davies {{looked at}} it in surprise.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{greeted him}} eagerly, {{and his eyes}} glistened with relief when <b>Harding</b> <b>handed</b> him the papers.|$|R
60|$|Brooke laughed curiously, but {{the girl}} noticed {{that one of his}} lean, <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> was closed as he looked down on her.|$|R
60|$|He {{would have}} said more, but that Tom of Mattawa laid a <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> on his {{shoulder}} and jerked him back into his chair.|$|E

60|$|Leland for {{a moment}} closed one of his <b>hard</b> <b>hands.</b> Presently he smiled again and, drawing another of the chairs up, sat down beside her.|$|R
60|$|Roy {{might never}} have been shot, judging {{from the way he}} stepped out, and Dale was almost as quick. Carmichael reached them--grasped them with swift, <b>hard</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try my best, you may believe, Biah," [...] said James, {{shaking the}} <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> heartily, {{as he turned}} on his way towards the cross-roads tavern.|$|E
60|$|Isbel {{moved so}} swiftly {{that she did}} not realize his {{intention}} until his <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> smote her mouth. Instantly she tasted the hot, salty blood from a cut lip.|$|E
6000|$|The smith {{looked up}} quickly, and scanned our hero with some interest; then, {{extending}} his great <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> across the table, he said, [...] "Welcome, messmate; sit down, I've only just begun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} could not keep away from us long," [...] said he, with the prompt cheerfulness of his boyhood, and laying hold of both of Uncle Lot's <b>hard</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Marble fairly gave in, {{placed his}} two <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> on his face, and I could see tears {{trickling}} from beneath them, as if water were squeezed from a stone.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{the idea}} seemed {{to fill his}} soul; and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> clasped, and tears ran down the cheeks.|$|R
60|$|The cheque {{was taken}} up and {{presented}} by Gaff on the following morning, but to the honest man's dismay, Lizzie declined it positively, though she accompanied her refusal with many earnest expressions of gratitude, and kissed the seaman's <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> at parting.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a big, <b>hard</b> <b>hand,</b> and {{has done}} much work, perhaps with the shovel, in a hot country--I think the Sud America," [...] she said. [...] "It will also hold the rifle. It is well to hold the rifle {{straight}} in Africa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} bronzed sailorman, with an {{impressive}} quietness, [...] "I hadn't any, and I don't think Wyllard had either. Still, he meant to make quite certain." [...] He spread a <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> out forcibly. [...] "He felt he had to." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{certainly}} {{seemed to}} do so, for gracious showers soon fell, and the little gardens bloomed freshly where the mothers' <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> had planted cabbages, onions, and potatoes to feed the children through the long winter.|$|R
6000|$|After a {{time the}} drawing-room door opened, {{but she did not}} heed it, meaning to be distant and indifferent; but a browner, <b>harder</b> <b>hand</b> than Arthur's was put down on the book before her, and an {{unexpected}} voice said, 'Detected!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It looks bad," [...] said Bounce, {{sitting down}} on a stone, {{clasping}} his <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> together, and resting an elbow on each knee. [...] "Sit ye down, Gibault. We'll think a bit, an' then go to work. That's wot we'll do-- d'ye see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's such {{a loving}} art,' said Mr. Peggotty, {{smoothing}} her rich hair with his great <b>hard</b> <b>hand,</b> 'that it can't abear the sorrer of this. It's nat'ral in young folk, Mas'r Davy, when they're new to these here trials, and timid, like my little bird,--it's nat'ral.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth sat {{very still}} for a moment or two, and slowly closed one <b>hard</b> <b>hand.</b> He had never {{expected}} such an offer from Wisbech, and he recognized that it would free him of all his difficulties if he accepted it. There was, however, an obstacle in the way.|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{away from}} him; {{she put her}} small <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> to her forehead; then moved it down, very slowly, but still hardly over her eyes, and kept it there, making no other sign, and still as death. Then she moved and {{continued}} her vague tale of terribleness.|$|E

5000|$|But {{where can}} we send those who intend to devote {{themselves}} to the practical applications of science? Our country abounds in men of action. <b>Hard</b> <b>hands</b> are ready to work upon our hard materials; and where shall sagacious heads be taught to direct those hands? Abbott Lawrence ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{you know}} why he is so sad," [...] said Marguerite in a strange, toneless voice which she seemed quite unable to control, for that tonelessness came from a terrible sense of suffocation, of a feeling as if her heart-strings were being gripped by huge, <b>hard</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{she came}} to a wider path. She {{scarcely}} noted it and passed on. Then came a quick rustle--a swift shadow. Between two steps--as her heart leaped--violent arms swept her off the ground. A <b>hard</b> <b>hand</b> was clapped over her mouth. She was being carried swiftly through the gloom.|$|E
60|$|This coxswain was Isaac Jarman, who {{for many}} years led the famous Ramsgate {{lifeboat}} into action, and helped to save hundreds of human lives.

60|$|There was {{something}} in Martin Poyser's throat at that moment which caused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion. Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better, and the two honest men grasped each other's <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> in mutual understanding.|$|R
60|$|This {{was what}} the decent-looking man with the <b>hard</b> <b>hands</b> and broken nails of a workman was doing-like a hungry dog. They kept up with him, in the fascination of the sight, to the next corner, where he turned down the side street still searching the gutter.|$|R
