The speed of the main rotor is controlled by an automated <b>fuel</b> supply <b>governor,</b> eliminating {{the necessity of a}} twist-grip throttle and a conventional link between the throttle and the collective-pitch. Instead, the Alouette II uses a simple control lever arrangement, which acts to directly regulate the collective-pitch and actuate the governor while immediately and automatically applying the correct level of power to conform with flight condition. Without a clutch, the transmission is considerably simplified in both design and maintenance aspects.|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2006 SAE International Study and {{modeling}} of transient operation {{is an important}} scientific objective. This {{is due to the}} fact that the majority of daily vehicle driving conditions involve transient operation, with non-linear situations experienced during engine transients. Thus, proper interconnection is needed between engine, <b>governor,</b> <b>fuel</b> pump, turbocharger and load. This paper surveys the publications available in the open literature concerning diesel engine simulations under transient operating conditions. Only those models that include both full engine thermodynamic calculations and dynamic powertrain modeling are taken into account, excluding those that focus on control design and optimization. Most of the attention is concentrated to the simulations that follow the filling and emptying modeling approach. A historical overview is given covering, in more detail, research groups with continuous and consistent study of transient operation. One of the main purposes of this paper is to summarize basic equations {{and modeling}} aspects concerning in-cylinder calculations, friction, turbocharger, engine dynamics, <b>governor,</b> <b>fuel</b> pump operation, and exhaust emissions during transients. The various limitations of the models are discussed together with the main aspects of transient operation (e. g. turbocharger lag, combustion and friction deterioration), which diversify it from the steady-state. Some of the most important findings in the field during the last 30 years are presented and discussed. The survey extends to special cases of transient diesel engine simulation, such as second-law analysis, response when the turbocharger compressor experiences surge, and whole vehicle performance. Several methods of improving transient response are also mentioned, based on the various simulations. An easy-to-read tabulation of all research groups dealing with the subject, that includes details about each model developed and engines/parameters studied, is also provided at the end of the paper...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a schematic {{diagram of the}} Euro- 3 diesel engine electronic control and describes hard- and software platform of the high pressure fuel pump pneumatic actuator control that allows to realize the concept of electronic fuel supply control of diesel engine KamAZ- 740. The strategic dependence beetwen the angular position of <b>fuel</b> pump <b>governor</b> lever and the angular position of electronic accelerator pedal were put {{on the basis of}} electronic control concept. Implementation of this dependence was carried out by applying a modulated PWM signal with determined duty cycle by the controller to the coil proportional solenoid valve, which is responsible for the amount of air pressure in the working chamber of the power air cylinder, connected by articulated-type to the governor lever of the high pressure fuel pump. In this case, the feedback control by position of governor lever of the high pressure fuel pump was introduced in the control circuit, but engine crankshaft speed control was carried out using a software continuous PID governor. Developed strategy gives possibility to track the deflection  of control parameter from a predetermined value by real-time and almost instantly, to make a control action on actuators to eliminate this deflection, while providing a minimum time of transition. Governor’s setting (proportional, integral and differential component) performed empirically using the classical Ziegler – Nichols method, based on the analysis of the safety factor of automatic control system.

40|$|Emergency diesel {{generators}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important contributors to the core damage failure rate of nuclear power plants. Current required testing and maintenance procedures are excessively strict and expensive without any real justification. Probabilistic risk assessment is used to propose a monitoring system and Technical Specification changes to reduce EDG unavailability without jeopardizing safety, and to ease the excessive deterministic requirements. The EDG fault tree is analyzed to identify the critical failure modes of the EDG, the failure of service water pumps, the failure of EDG building ventilation dampers, and the failure of the EDG "supercomponent," which includes the fuel oil, lubricating oil, cooling water, and starting air systems. We use data from the nuclear industry and the U. S. Navy to identify the most significant EDG supercomponent failure modes, including system fluid leakages, instrumentation & controls failures, electrical power output failures, and the <b>fuel</b> system <b>governors.</b> The monitoring system proposed includes instrumentation for twenty-one of the 121 basic events in the fault tree, for a total of 94. 9 % of EDG failure contributions. The failure modes identified with industry data are monitored, as are diesel engine mechanical failures currently assessed with teardown inspections. With a 50 % reduction in these twenty-one basic event failure rates, the EDG system failure rate is reduced by 41. 6 %, from 0. 097 per year to 0. 059 per year. With this reduced failure rate, we propose to extend the EDG surveillance interval from one month to twelve months, to lengthen the running tests from one hour to twenty-four hours, and to eliminate the tear-down inspections conducted during refueling outages. To fully assess the benefits of these proposed changes, the monitoring system should be installed on an EDG on a trial basis. The work reported here demonstrates the feasible gains which can be realized, and proposes, a method for evaluating the efficacy of the system as realized through experimentation.

40|$|This study investigates {{experimentally}} {{the effects}} of hydrogen addition in the intake manifold of a diesel generator operating with a 7 % biodiesel-diesel oil blend (B 7). An experimental apparatus setup was used to conduct performance and emissions tests in a single cylinder, air cooled diesel engine. This setup consisted of a generator set connected to a wirewound resistor load bank {{that was used to}} vary engine load. In addition, a flowmeter was used to determine hydrogen volumetric flowrate and a digital anemometer coupled with an air box to measure air flowrate. Furthermore, a digital precision electronic scale was used to measure engine fuel consumption and a gas analyzer was used to determine exhaust gas composition and exhaust gas temperature. A thermopar was installed near the exhaust collection to measure cylinder temperature. In-cylinder pressure was measured using an AVL Indumicro data acquisition system with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. An AVL optical encoder was installed in the crankshaft and synchronized with in-cylinder pressure in real time. The experimental procedure consisted of injecting hydrogen into the engine intake manifold at different mass concentrations of 2, 6, 8 and 10 % of total fuel mass (B 7 + hydrogen), which represented energy fractions of 5, 15, 20 and 24 % of total fuel energy respectively. Due to hydrogen addition, the total amount of fuel energy introduced increased and the generators <b>fuel</b> injection <b>governor</b> prevented any increases of engine speed. Several conclusions can be stated from the test results. A reduction in specific fuel consumption as a function of hydrogen concentration increase was noted. Likewise, carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) decreased as hydrogen concentration increased. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides emissions (NOx) increased due to average temperatures inside the cylinder being higher. There was also an increase in peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate inside the cylinder, since the fuel ignition delay was smaller due to hydrogen content increase. All this indicates that hydrogen promotes faster combustion and higher heat release rates and can be an important additive to all kind of fuels used in diesel generators...|$|R
