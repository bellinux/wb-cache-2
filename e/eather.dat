5|$|Due to the {{unpredictable}} weather, aircraft continued {{to arrive at}} Nadzab sporadically. Only the 2/25th Infantry Battalion {{and part of the}} 2/33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Ken <b>Eather,</b> to initiate the advance on Lae. That day there were 112 landings at Nadzab. On 9 September, as the advance began, the rest of the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab from Tsili Tsili, but while there were 116 landings at Nadzab, bad weather prevented the 2/31st Infantry Battalion from leaving Port Moresby. Finally, on 12 September, after three non-flying days, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab on some of the 130 landings on the two strips at Nadzab that day.|$|E
5|$|Between the wars, the reservists enjoyed {{much better}} {{promotion}} prospects. While Alan Vasey, {{a major in}} the First AIF, was not promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel until 1937, Kenneth <b>Eather,</b> a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I, was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935. Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers, who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy. Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige, Arthur Allen, Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring. Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders. The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer, Ivan Dougherty, David Whitehead, Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability.|$|E
5|$|The 2/1st Infantry Battalion {{began its}} advance on {{schedule}} at 0900, but the lead platoon came under {{heavy machine gun}} fire from Post 54, and Italian artillery knocked out the supporting mortars. The 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery engaged the Italian guns and the platoon withdrew. Colonel <b>Eather</b> then organised a formal attack on Post 54 for 1330, following a bombardment of the post by artillery and mortars. The Italian guns were silenced when an Australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition dump. The Australians then captured the post. About {{a third of its}} defenders had been killed in the fighting. The remaining 66 surrendered. This prompted a general collapse of the Italian position in the north. Posts 56 and 61 surrendered without a fight and white flags were raised over Posts 58, 60, 63 and 65, and the gun positions near Post 58. By nightfall, Eather's men had advanced as far as Post 69 and only the fourteen northernmost posts still held out in the Gerfan sector.|$|E

5|$|Vasey was {{concerned}} about the security of the Kaiapit area, as he believed that the Japanese were inclined to continue with a plan once it was in motion. Taking advantage of good flying weather on 22 September, 99 round trips were made between Nadzab and Kaiapit. Most of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion and some American engineers were flown in. The 2/14th Infantry Battalion and a battery of the 2/4th Field Regiment arrived on 25 September, and Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather's</b> 25th Infantry Brigade began to arrive two days later, freeing Dougherty to advance on Dumpu.|$|R

25|$|Vasey {{flew into}} Kaiapit {{to talk to}} Dougherty.

Vasey believed that the open area between the Umi and Kaiapit would be an excellent place to destroy the Japanese force, should it choose to attack. He therefore proposed to halt for a while, reinforcing the position at Kaiapit with Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather's</b> 25th Infantry Brigade rather than displacing it forward as originally intended.

This put Rowell and Blamey on a collision course. They had a history of animosity going back to earlier in the war, first in the Middle East then in Greece. Rowell felt that Blamey should have supported him and stood up to Curtin and MacArthur. Relations were fractious, and on 28 September Rowell had had enough.

25|$|<b>Eather</b> {{pressed on}} the coast, where the 25th Infantry Brigade {{encountered}} well-prepared Japanese {{positions in the}} Battle of Buna-Gona. Eather's men suffered heavy casualties from the enemy and tropical diseases, the 25th Infantry Brigade being almost wiped out. Eather's leadership at Gona was not as energetic as usual, perhaps because, like most of his men, he was malnourished and ill with malaria. <b>Eather</b> would suffer a series of relapses of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Eather's force now {{began to}} push the Japanese back over the mountains, but slowly. On 27 October, General Sir Thomas Blamey {{relieved}} Allen, replacing him with Major General George Alan Vasey, an officer that <b>Eather</b> distrusted, holding him responsible {{for the destruction of}} the 2/1st on Crete.

2500|$|Throughout October, the Australians, {{supported}} by US air assets which were heavily bombing Japanese lines of communication, {{had sought to}} wrest control of the campaign, and significant actions were fought around Templeton's Crossing and Eora Creek as the Australians went on the offensive. Progress was slow, and in the aftermath, the Australian high command relieved Major General Arthur Allen of his command, replacing him with Major General George Vasey. Finally, on 2 November Kokoda was secured by the troops from Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather's</b> 25th Brigade. The recapture of Kokoda provided the Allies with a forward airfield into which supplies could be flown, helping to ease the resupply issues that had slowed the Allied pursuit up to that point, with supplies of ammunition and food greatly improving the situation for the Allied troops [...] and enabling soldiers who had been pressed into portage tasks carrying supplies up the track, to be re-allocated to combat duties. The forward airfield also greatly reduced the time taken to evacuate casualties to Port Moresby, greatly improving a wounded soldier’s chances of survival.|$|R
40|$|Jar test is {{a simple}} test {{developed}} to determine the reaction of weak rock material to water during {{a certain period of}} time which can be tested on irregular bulk samples. It indicates the porosity, grain interactions and density of the material. The total index observed during a 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes sequence was found to be a good indicator for the classification. This should enable the classifying of the weak rock material to be carried out based on the slaking index. The r eaction of the rock matter was inevitable after immersing the sample in the jar with water. The slaking index or changes in the sample also depend on the duration of the immersion time.

40|$|The w. <b>eathering</b> of feldspars and micas {{begins with}} a series of surface {{reactions}} m which metallic cations of the mineral (e. g. Na, K, Ca, Mg) pass into solution in exchange for hydrogen ions or other cations. How-ever, many of our simple concepts of exchange reactions fail. For in-stance, the exchange capacity of feldspar surfaces is not a constant but varies greatly with the exchanging cation. The ammonium ion penetrates the surface readily and gives a high capacity; magnesium gives a much lower value. Ammonium also becomes fixed at feldspar surfaces and can then only be removed by boiling in alkali. In all exchange reactions with feldspar surfaces, the previous history was shown to be of great impor-tance. These facts are explained by the formation of a surface layer consisting of somewhat loosened and distorted feldspar chains. The micas, on the other hand, showed much more normal surface exchange. How-ever, the geometry of the exchanging sites was found to be of great im-portance. These were shown to be of more than one kind, characterized by different bonding energies towards cations. Further, the exchange-ability of any one cation was highly dependent upon the extent and kind of occup. ancy of the exchange sites. This was very strikingly shown by curves •n which the selectivity numbers were plotted against surface occupancy. These reactions represent he first step in weathering processes, at a stage when new mineral species have not yet made their appearance...|$|R
2500|$|Following a brief {{pause to}} {{resupply}} with air drops occurring around Kobara, on 4 November 1942, the Australian advance continued after securing Kokoda, carried by Vasey's 7th Division, with Brigadier John Lloyd's 16th Brigade, which {{had come up}} from Alola and bypassed Kokoda, assuming the lead from the 25th Brigade. Setting out from Kobara, they advanced north towards Pirivi, before striking east towards Oivi. Out of the mountains, and amidst {{the heat of the}} more open low land countryside, the advance was slow. Nevertheless, the Australians pushed forward along the narrower north–south track that ran between Kokoda and Sanananda, until they were halted along the high ground around Oivi by a strongly entrenched Japanese force. In the fighting that ensued, the two Australian brigades– [...] Lloyd's 16th and <b>Eather's</b> 25th – consisting of 3,700 men, engaged the remnants of the Japanese 41st Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Kiyomi Yazawa, and 144th Infantry Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Tsukamoto Hiroshi. Together these regiments formed the South Seas Detachment (Nankai Shintai), a 2,800-strong formation under the command of General Tomitaro Horii, supported by 15 mountain guns from the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment and 30 heavy machine guns. Camouflaged and strengthened with palm logs, with interlocking fields of fire and snipers in rubber and palm trees, the positions were well established, having been constructed over several weeks and the Japanese defenders were determined to make a stand. The Australians, who had lacked artillery for most of the campaign, were buoyed by the plentiful supply of mortar rounds due to the proximity of the landing strip at Kokoda.|$|R

40|$|Weathering rate models {{designed}} for watersheds combine chemical data of discharging waters with morphologic and hydrologic {{parameters of the}} catchments. At the spring watershed scale, evaluation of morphologic parameters is subjective due to difficulties in conceiving the catchment geometry. Besides, when springs emerge from crystalline massifs, rock structure must be accounted in formulas describing the area of minerals exposed to the percolating fluids, for a realistic evaluation of the rates. These particular features {{are not included in}} the available approaches and for that reason a new model was developed, coined THROW model. This is a lumped approach that integrates (T) opography, (H) ydrology, (RO) ck structure and (W) <b>eathering</b> in a single algorithm. The study area comprises several stream watersheds and spring sites of the Vouga River basin (northern Portugal), shaped on granites. Firstly, the THROW model couples a terrain modeling analysis with hydrologic models based on discharge rates, to determine hydraulic conductivities (K), effective porosities (ne) and annual recharges (Vr) at the stream watershed scale. Subsequently, these parameters are used in a water balance model to estimate concomitant groundwater travel times (t). The mean K [(4. 7 ± 3. 2) × 10 − 7 m s− 1] and ne [(2. 0 ± 1. 3) × 10 − 2] values are adopted as proxies for the spring watersheds and a firm regression equation is defined between time and stream watershed area (A). Secondly, two more runs of terrain modeling analysis are executed to extrapolate morphologic parameters for the spring watersheds. The first run hinges on scaling properties of the drainage networks, known as Horton laws, and is used to scale watershed areas across stream orders (i). The scaling function is described by another regression equation. The second run evaluates the order of a spring watershed, defined as equivalent order (ieq) and equated to the mean order of the surrounding stream watersheds. Having calculated the ieq, spring watershed areas and travel times were downscaled using the regression equations (A < 10 km 2 and t = 1. 4 – 2. 8 year). Standing on the physical and hydrologic parameters of the spring watersheds, the THROW model finally calculates plagioclase weathering rates {{in the vicinity of the}} spring sites. The SiB model (Pacheco and Van der Weijden, 1996) was used before to estimate the contribution of plagioclase dissolution to the chemical composition of these springs (Van der Weijden and Pacheco, 2006). The chemical data were now coupled with K, ne and t in a rate equation to estimate chemical weathering rates of plagioclase in the basin. In the THROW model, the rate equation describes the exposed surface area as a function of fracture spacings, openings and porosities (Pacheco and Alencoão, 2006). The calculated rates (WPl = (2. 5 ± 1. 2) × 10 − 14 mol m− 2 s− 1) are consistent with previous reports and with results of experimental kinetic models. The SiB results predict formation of halloysite and gibbsite along the flow path, which were indeed close to equilibrium with the dissolved Al and Si activities. âº Develop a weathering model that incorporates rock structure in the rate equation. âº Conceive a weathering model especially {{designed for}} fracture artesian springs. âº Create a model that integrates topography, hydrology, rock structure and weatherin...|$|R
25|$|Although the Japanese were {{successful}} in pushing the Australian defenders back in the centre of their position on the track, heavy fighting on the flanks of the position blunted the Japanese attack, bringing it to a standstill. In the aftermath, the Australian commander, Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather,</b> perceiving that the attack could not be held any further and that Ioribaiwa Ridge was unsuited to launching a counter-attack, withdrew his force back to Imita Ridge. The Japanese, however, had reached the limit of their supply line and after the fighting around Ioribaiwa. Regardless, strategic factors and reverses elsewhere forced the Japanese commander, Major General Tomitaro Horii, to pursue a more defensive approach in Papua and New Guinea. As a result, in October the Japanese began to withdraw towards their beachheads Buna–Gona, with the Australians in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Imita Ridge, {{only a short}} {{distance}} from Port Moresby, ultimately proved to be the limit of the Japanese advance south. Having exhausted their supply line, which was increasingly being interdicted by US and Australian aircraft, and as events elsewhere, particularly Guadalcanal, coupled with the earlier defeat around Milne Bay, turned in favour of the Allies, the Japanese were forced into adopting a more defensive posture in New Guinea. Instead of a final stand, the fighting around Imita Ridge petered out into a series of small-scale patrol actions, before the Japanese began withdrawing north, beginning on 26 September. The remnants of the Australian 21st Brigade were led south by Porter, while the Australians, bolstered by the arrival of fresh troops from the 25th Brigade, launched a counter-attack under <b>Eather,</b> who officially assumed command of Maroubra Force on 17 September.|$|E
25|$|Further {{fighting}} {{took place}} around Ioribaiwa where the Australians {{finally managed to}} fight the Japanese to a standstill before withdrawing further to Imita Ridge, where they established a final defensive line for a last stand. Before this climactic battle could take place though; the Japanese reached the limit of their supply line and the strategic situation elsewhere in the Pacific– specifically the defeats around Milne Bay and on Guadacanal– resulted in the tide shifting towards the Australians, as the Japanese commander, Horii, received orders to assume a defensive posture rather than continuing the drive on Port Moresby. After the Japanese withdrew from Ioribaiwa in late September, troops from the Australian 25th Brigade, under Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather,</b> later reinforced by Brigader John Lloyd's 16th Brigade, both under Major General Arthur Allen, commander of the Australian 7th Division, began advancing north from Imita Ridge along the Kokoda Track.|$|E
25|$|After this, {{a series}} of engagements took place over a six-week period to reduce the main Japanese {{position}} around Mount Sugi, commencing with the 19th Infantry Battalion's assault across the Wulwut River on 5 March. The position around Mount Sugi, which stretched across a number of ridges {{to the west of}} the Wulwut, was heavily defended with mortars, machine guns and pillboxes, and heavy rain also frustrated Australian attempts to reduce the Japanese stronghold. Heavy fighting followed, culminating with the 14th/32nd's attack on Bacon Hill on 18 March. Following the capture of Waitavalo–Tol area in March–April, the Australians exploited towards Jammer Bay and sent patrols to link up their northern and southern drives. They also brought in reinforcements, first from the 13th Infantry Brigade and then the 4th, as the offensive part of their campaign effectively came to an end. A series of command changes occurred around this time, also. In April, Major General Horace Robertson took over command from Ramsay, while Major General Kenneth <b>Eather</b> assumed control in early August. In the months that followed, the Australians mounted {{a series of}} patrols aimed at maintaining the line around the neck of the Gazelle Peninsula to prevent any attempt by the Japanese to break out from Rabaul. This lasted until the end of the war in August 1945.|$|E
25|$|As Japanese {{artillery}} and mortars began shelling the Australian position {{from the northern}} slope overlooking Ofi Creek, several minor skirmishes were fought around the position {{over the course of}} 12–13 September. Lacking their own artillery support, there was little the Australian defenders could do to counter the Japanese indirect fire, but several Japanese probing patrols were turned back, and elements of the Australian 2/16th and 3rd Infantry Battalions sprung a successful ambush around Ofi Creek, killing between 20 and 30 Japanese who were lured into an abandoned food dump. Meanwhile, the fresh 25th Brigade, under Brigadier Kenneth <b>Eather</b> arrived from Port Moresby, advancing from Imita Ridge to Ioribaiwa with orders to launch a counter-attack, passing through Porter's position to advance to Nauro. With the arrival of these troops, Maroubra Force swelled to 2,957 personnel, providing the Australians with size advantage over the 1,650-strong Japanese committed to the battle. The 2/25th Infantry Battalion was subsequently laid down south of the ridge in depth, in the low ground forward of the Ua-Ule Creek, to provide a reserve force to be committed in case of emergency. Meanwhile, the 25th Brigade's other two battalions– the 2/31st and 2/33rd– made preparations to launch an attack either side of the defensive line, to outflank the pursuing Japanese in an effort to cut the track at Nauro.|$|E
500|$|By this time, the 9th Division {{was about}} [...] East of Lae, while the 7th Division was [...] away and [...] "it {{appeared}} an odds-on {{bet that the}} 9th would reach Lae first". The 7th Division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 September. The last ten Japanese troops facing the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion were killed and the 2/25th Infantry Battalion passed through its position and headed for Lae. As they moved down the Markham Valley Road, they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily. Brigadier <b>Eather</b> came up in his jeep and started urging the diggers to hurry up. They were unimpressed. <b>Eather,</b> armed with a pistol, then acted as leading scout, with his troops following in a column of route behind him. The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese but aircraft of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs, wounding two men. Whitehead soon received a message sent in the clear from Vasey that read: [...] "Only the Fifth Air Force bombers are preventing me from entering Lae." [...] By early afternoon, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached the Lae airfield where it killed 15 Japanese soldiers and captured one. The 25th Infantry Brigade then came under fire from the 9th Division's 25-pounders, wounding one soldier. Vasey and <b>Eather</b> tried every available means to inform Wootten of the situation.
