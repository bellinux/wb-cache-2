This will include the use of hyperspectral imaging to photograph the manuscripts to look for hidden information such as erased or faded text. This is to be done in cooperation with the British Library.|$|E

5|$|A British {{horsewoman}} named Francesca Kelly {{founded a}} group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, {{with the goal of}} promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a group that works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E

5|$|Francois Fillon then visited Guadaloupe {{and brought}} with him a team of <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of the Interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage. The local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity. Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, {{both of which were}} quickly repaired.|$|E
5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally {{covered in a}} sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States spent {{a period of}} time in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{alleged that}} the EIS focused almost {{exclusively}} on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and {{that it did not}} consider the effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising the speed limit or allowing trucks. Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from MN5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges, were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988, and to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26years after construction began. The 1990 opening ceremony of I-35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played.|$|E
