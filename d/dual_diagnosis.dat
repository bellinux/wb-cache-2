This study aimed to estimate psychiatric disorders in parents of children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder (BID). Methods and Materials. In this cross-sectional study, during 2012 - 2013, all of the children and adolescents diagnosed with BID based on Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version were included. All of the parents (both mother and father) were evaluated by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Statistical Analysis. Prevalence rates are reported and independent-sample t-test and chi-square test were used when appropriate. Results. A total of 108 families were interviewed. 25 % of mothers and 33 % of fathers met the criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder, with major depressive disorder, BMD, and cluster B personality disorder being more prevalent. Fathers were more likely to receive a <b>dual</b> psychiatric <b>diagnosis.</b> Cluster B personality disorder and substance dependence were more prevalent among fathers while major depressive disorder was more prevalent among mothers.

25|$|Addiction {{psychiatry}} {{focuses on}} evaluation {{and treatment of}} individuals with alcohol, drug, or other substance-related disorders, and of individuals with <b>dual</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of substance-related and other psychiatric disorders. Biological psychiatry; an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorders {{in terms of the}} biological function of the nervous system. Child and adolescent psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in work with children, teenagers, and their families. Community psychiatry is an approach that reflects an inclusive public health perspective and is practiced in community mental health services. Cross-cultural psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services. Emergency psychiatry is the clinical application of psychiatry in emergency settings. Forensic psychiatry utilizes medical science generally, and psychiatric knowledge and assessment methods in particular, to help answer legal questions. Geriatric psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in the elderly. Global Mental Health is an area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide. Liaison psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in the interface between other medical specialties and psychiatry. Military psychiatry covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context. Neuropsychiatry is a branch of medicine dealing with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system. Social psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental well-being.|$|E

Noise can be reduced using iterative reconstruction or by combining data from multiple scans. This enables lower radiation dose and higher resolution scans. Metal artifacts can also be reduced using iterative reconstruction, resulting in more accurate <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>Dual</b> and multi-energy (photon counting) CT can reduce beam hardening and provide better tissue contrast.

2500|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (also called co-occurring disorders, COD, or dual pathology) is the [...] {{condition}} of {{suffering from a}} mental illness and a comorbid substance abuse problem. [...] There is considerable debate surrounding the appropriateness of using a single category for a heterogeneous group of individuals with complex needs and a varied range of problems. The concept can be used broadly, for example depression and alcoholism, {{or it can be}} restricted to specify severe mental illness (e.g. psychosis, schizophrenia) and substance misuse disorder (e.g. cannabis abuse), or a person who has a milder mental illness and a drug dependency, such as panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and is dependent on opioids. [...] Diagnosing a primary psychiatric illness in substance abusers is challenging as drug abuse itself often induces psychiatric symptoms, thus making it necessary to differentiate between substance induced and pre-existing mental illness.|$|E

These individuals (i.e., state office personnel, private sector personnel, and non-profit, now voluntary sector personnel) were the forefront brigade to develop the community programs, which today may be referred to by names such as supported housing, psychiatric rehabilitation, supported or transitional employment, sheltered workshops, supported education, daily living skills, affirmative industries, <b>dual</b> <b>diagnosis</b> treatment, individual and family psychoeducation, adult day care, foster care, family services and mental health counseling.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in high-throughput sequence capture methods and next-generation sequencing technologies have now made exome sequencing a viable approach to elucidate the genetic basis of Mendelian disorders with hitherto unknown etiology. In addition, exome sequencing is increasingly being {{employed as a}} diagnostic tool for specific genetic diseases, particularly {{in the context of}} those disorders characterized by significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, for example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and congenital disorders of glycosylation. Such disorders are challenging to interrogate with conventional polymerase chain reaction–Sanger sequencing methods, because of the inherent difficulty in prioritizing candidate genes for diagnostic testing. Here, we explore the value of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool and discuss whether exome sequencing can come to serve a <b>dual</b> role in <b>diagnosis</b> and discovery. We summarize the current status of exome sequencing, the technical challenges facing it, and its adaptation to diagnostics, and make recommendations for the use of exome sequencing as a routine diagnostic tool.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diagnostic {{reasoning}} {{involves the}} thinking {{steps up to}} and including arrival at a <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>Dual</b> process theory posits that a physician's thinking is based on both non-analytic or fast, subconscious thinking and analytic thinking that is slower, more conscious, effortful and characterized by comparing and contrasting alternatives. Expertise in clinical reasoning may relate to the two dimensions measured by the diagnostic thinking inventory (DTI) : memory structure and flexibility in thinking. AIM: Explored the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates of these two aspects of the DTI: memory structure and flexibility of thinking. METHODS: Participants answered and reflected upon multiple-choice questions (MCQs) during fMRI. A DTI was completed shortly after the scan. The brain processes associated with the two dimensions of the DTI were correlated with fMRI phases - assessing flexibility in thinking during analytical clinical reasoning, memory structure during non-analytical clinical reasoning and the total DTI during both non-analytical and analytical reasoning in experienced physicians. RESULTS: Each DTI component was associated with distinct functional neuroanatomic activation patterns, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSION: Our findings support diagnostic thinking conceptual models and indicate mechanisms through which cognitive demands may induce functional adaptation within the prefrontal cortex. This provides additional objective validity evidence {{for the use of the}} DTI in medical education and practice settings...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{ultrasound}} contrast agents has deeply {{modified the}} role of ultrasound in diagnostic procedures but also in therapeutic schemes. The specific properties of those UCA’s has provided new insights in imaging methods with the wide use of non linear imaging sequences. The availability of a real time assessment of contrast enhancement is now accepted as a reference method for the characterization of lesions with an accuracy higher than 95 % in liver lesions. This is confirmed by edition of EFSUMB recommandations for the routine use of UCA’s. The intravascular characteristics of those agents allow their use to quantify the microvessel density for the monitoring of treatments such as anti-angiogenic treatments by a direct assessment of changes in lesion vascularity. Therapeutic applications are based on two different possibilities, one driven by the interaction between bubbles and ultrasound waves inducing a local increase in energy deposit resulting in enlarged lesion or thrombolytic effect. The second possibility {{is related to the}} capacity of bubbles to improve drug or gene delivery with an increased drug efficacy or cell transfection. All these new developments in ultrasound in conjonction with microbubbles have emphasized the impact of ultrasound with a <b>dual</b> role in <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment...|$|R
2500|$|Schizoid {{individuals}} frequently act {{out with}} substance {{and alcohol abuse}} and other addictions which serve as substitutes for human relationships (see <b>dual</b> <b>diagnosis).</b> The substitute of a nonhuman for a human object serves as a schizoid defense. Providing examples of how the schizoid individual creates a personal relation with the drug, Seinfeld tells of an addict who called heroin his [...] "soothing white pet," [...] and of others who referred to crack as their [...] "bad mama" [...] or [...] "boyfriend." [...] He explains that [...] "Not all addicts name their drug, but there often is the trace of a personal feeling about the relationship." [...] The object relations view emphasizes that the drug use and alcoholism reinforce the fantasy of union with an internal object, yet enable the addict to be indifferent to the external object world. Addiction is therefore a schizoid and symbiotic defense.|$|E
