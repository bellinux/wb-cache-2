5|$|In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band {{played at}} the same gig. Tyler {{immediately}} loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition.

The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.|$|E
5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E

Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death.

They saw {{each other at the}} Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, he {{was taken}} from his cradle and adopted by his {{maternal}} uncle Kaihupaʻa to be raised in the Hawaiian custom of hānai, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of Paths of Glory in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, {{until his death in}} 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also felt {{throughout}} Nova Scotia. Winds peaked at 70mph (115km/h) in Lockeport, the strongest winds {{observed in the}} Canadian province. In Yarmouth, the storm's gusts were clocked at 60mph (100km/h) in Yarmouth. Trees were uprooted {{as a result of}} the strong winds. One tree fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in Melville Cove, damaging the home's roof. Cabins were damaged in Summerville, and the garage of a lodge in Digby was blown out. A barn and associated equipment were destroyed in Pembroke. The strong winds also blew down numerous communication lines, disrupting telecommunication services across Nova Scotia. Downed wires in Halifax caused a fire which scorched five buildings. Traffic in the city was also disrupted by the winds. In addition to infrastructure, crops were also heavily damaged. In Digby County, grain and corn plantations were damaged. Grain crops in Cumberland County also saw heavy losses. In Annapolis Valley, an important agricultural region in western Nova Scotia, 600,000barrels of apples were lost, resulting in CA$1.5million in damages. The lost apple production accounted for roughly half of the entire apple yield for the agricultural region. Despite the hurricane's rapid movement through the Canadian Maritimes, the storm still produced heavy rainfall. In Halifax, 3in (75mm) of rain was reported over the duration of the hurricane. However, 3.5in (90mm) of rain fell in Yarmouth in a 24-hour period.|$|E
