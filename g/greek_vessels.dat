25|$|Carthage was a {{republic}} {{that dominated the}} political, military and economic affairs of the western Mediterranean Sea, especially on the North African coasts and islands, and above all, due to its navy. It originated as a Phoenician colony in Africa, near modern Tunis. Carthage had become a wealthy centre for trade networks extending from Gadir (Cádiz) along the coasts of southern Iberia and North Africa, across the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, and the western half of Sicily, to the ports of the eastern Mediterranean, including Tyre, its mother city, {{on the shores of}} the Levant. At the height of power, just before the First Punic War, Carthage was hostile to foreign ships (such as Roman and <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels)</b> in the western Mediterranean.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "abiding {{passion of}} his life" [...] was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample {{opportunities}} in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels</b> {{were found in}} 1974 amidst {{the wreck of the}} HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, [...] "transform him into a television personality." [...] A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams [...] "crowned his career" [...] by taking to pieces the Portland Vase, [...] "probably the most famous glass object in the world", and putting it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1828, Cambrian {{was again}} {{involved}} in the suppression of piracy {{as part of a}} squadron under Commodore Sir Thomas Staines. Staines took a small squadron to the island of Grabusa, off Cape Busa (Vouxa) to deal with a nest of Greek pirates that had made the harbour there their home after the Greeks had taken possession of it early in the war against the Turks in Crete. The squadron consisted of Cambrian, Pelican, , , , , and two French corvettes. [...] In the port there were 14 <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels,</b> together with an Austrian and an Ionian merchantman that the pirates had taken. After the pirates had refused to surrender, the squadron opened fire and destroyed a number of the vessels. Marines from Pelican and Isis then landed to take possession of the fortress there. However, as the squadron left, Isis struck Cambrian, causing her to broadside the rocks in the narrow channel. Cambrian settled in [...] shallow water and her entire crew left in an orderly manner. The strong swell then broke up Cambrian.|$|E

2500|$|In 1811 Gleaner sailed for the Mediterranean. Early in 1811, Lieutenant Alexander Branch was First {{lieutenant}} on , {{which was}} {{operating in the}} Aegean archipelago. Captain Charles Ferguson of Pylades ordered Branch {{to take charge of}} the [...] "armed ketch" [...] Gleaner, during the [...] temporary absence of her proper commander, and to search all the <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels</b> he could find to see if they were carrying French cargoes under a neutral flag. Off Samos Gleaner encountered a polacca of 12 long guns and 70 men. A two-hour single-ship action ensued before the pollaca struck. During the action a cannon ball mangled Branch's right leg. He lay essentially untreated until Gleaner was able to reach Smyrna five days later, where his leg was amputated. He then endured three months of suffering before he was able to heal. Despite the gallantry of the action, Branch did not receive promotion, and it was another two years before he received a pension for his injuries. As soon as he was able to move on crutches, Lieutenant Branch returned to Pylades and remained senior lieutenant on her until she returned to England in late 1811. The Sublime Porte claimed the polacca on the grounds that she belonged to an Ottoman subject. The British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte argued that she should be declared a legitimate prize, but was unable to prevail and she was restored to Ottoman control.|$|E
60|$|As to Mr. Thornton's voyages in the Black Sea with <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{they gave}} him the same idea of Greece as a cruise to Berwick in a Scotch smack would of Johnny Groat's house. Upon what grounds then does he arrogate the right of condemning by {{wholesale}} a body of men of whom he can know little? It is rather a curious circumstance that Mr. Thornton, who so lavishly dispraises Pouqueville on every occasion of mentioning the Turks, has yet recourse to him as authority on the Greeks, and terms him an impartial observer. Now, Dr. Pouqueville is as little entitled to that appellation as Mr. Thornton to confer it on him.|$|E

In July 1941, she sank the Norwegian tanker Ida Knudsen. A year later, she sank the British vessel Scottish Star and the Panamanian motor tanker Esso Copenhagen.|$|R
60|$|The {{discussion}} {{on that occasion}} was conducted warmly, for the pirates believed that they had made a good and legitimate prize {{in the shape of}} a <b>Greek</b> <b>vessel,</b> which was owned by a Mr and Mrs de Lisle, who, with their little son, were also captured.|$|R

60|$|The Roman citizen {{was in this}} {{instance}} a Mediterranean Jew who chanced to be a British subject. His house at Athens had for some reason or other been sacked by the mob; he presented a demand for compensation absurdly fraudulent {{on the face of}} it. The Greek government refused to pay. England despatched the fleet to collect this and some other petty accounts outstanding. Russia and France proposed their good offices; the mediation of France was accepted; then a number of <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels</b> were peremptorily seized, and France in umbrage recalled her ambassador from London. Well might Peel, in the last speech ever delivered by him in the House of Commons, describe such a course of action as consistent neither with the dignity nor the honour of England. The debate travelled far beyond Don Pacifico, and it stands to this day as a grand classic exposition in parliament of the contending views as to the temper and the principles on which nations in our modern era should conduct their dealings with one another.|$|E

In 1850 Great Britain blockaded the ports of Greece in order to compel the Hellenic government to give satisfaction in the Don Pacifico case. Don Pacifico, a British subject, claimed 32,000 as damages for unprovoked pillage of his house by an Athenian mob. <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels</b> only were seized, and these were only sequestered. <b>Greek</b> <b>vessels</b> bonafide carrying cargoes belonging to foreigners were allowed to enter the blockaded ports.|$|E
