5|$|Liverpool {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup by finishing fourth in the 1999–2000 FA Premier League. Their opposition {{in the first round}} were Rapid București of Romania. The first leg was held at Rapid's home ground Stadionul Giuleşti-Valentin Stănescu, Liverpool won 1–0, Nick Barmby scored the winning goal. The second leg at Liverpool's home ground Anfield finished 0–0, which meant that Liverpool won the tie 1–0 on aggregate to progress to the second round. Liverpool's opposition in the second round was Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic. The first leg at Anfield was heading for a 0–0 draw, until the 87th minute when Emile Heskey scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 victory. The second leg was at Liberec's home ground, the Stadion u Nisy. Liberec took the lead in the first half to level the tie at 1–1. Midway through the first half, Liverpool equalised to make it 1–1 on the night and 2–1 in their favour <b>in</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Two further goals in the second half by Barmby and Michael Owen, before a late Liberec goal ensured Liverpool won the match 3–2 to progress to the third round after a 4–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmino acids are {{substrates}} widely {{present in}} soils {{either in a}} free or a polymeric state and represent a large input of organic nitrogen into most terrestrial ecosystems. However, their behaviour in soil remains poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess critically the impact of sorption on the mineralization of two contrastingly charged amino acids, lysine and leucine, in different-sized, real soil <b>aggregates.</b> <b>In</b> a first experiment, we assessed the spatial variability of amino acid mineralization <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of different sizes. After 1 day of incubation coefficients of variation of leucine mineralization were 33 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 2 - 3 mm, 15 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 3 - 5 mm and 14 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 5 - 7 mm diameter. Coefficients of variation of lysine mineralization were, after 1 day of incubation, 24 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 2 - 3 mm, 26 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 3 - 5 mm and 24 % <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> of 5 - 7 mm diameter. Compared with other substrates, this variability is small and could be due to the presence of degrading microorganisms <b>in</b> all <b>aggregates.</b> We also studied the activity of such microorganisms by following the evolution with time of 14 C-amino acids in different compartments within aggregates 3 - 5 mm diameter (mineralized 14 C, microbial biomass 14 C, 14 C in soil solution and residual 14 C in soil). The microorganisms that degrade amino acids were able to assimilate substrates in soil solution immediately and used them preferentially for their growth and not solely for their energy production. For lysine, intense competition between adsorption and assimilation by microorganisms occurred from the start of the incubation period and persisted with time. Our results clearly show that sorption may retard biodegradation of amino acids in soil...|$|R

40|$|Rat {{pituitary}} cell <b>aggregates</b> cultured <b>in</b> serum-free {{chemically defined}} medium, single cells, and hemipituitaries {{were used in}} a perifusion system to study the influence of angiotensin II (AII) on GH release. <b>In</b> <b>aggregates</b> the peptide displayed both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on GH release, depending on the hormonal conditions of the culture medium {{and the age of}} the animal. When cultured in the absence of glucocorticoid, a modest but statistically significant stimulation was seen <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> from immature as well as adult animals. <b>In</b> <b>aggregates</b> from 5 -day-old animals, dexamethasone (DEX) strongly enhanced the GH-releasing activity of AII in a dose-dependent way; <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> from 14 - and 25 -day-old rats, the same pattern was found, although the stimulatory action was weaker than the effect in 5 -day-old rats. <b>In</b> <b>aggregates</b> from adult animals, the glucocorticoid established an inhibitory effect of AII on GH release, an effect seen with both low and high concentrations of DEX. These age- and DEX-dependent effects were not found for AII stimulation of PRL release. In the presence of DEX, AII also inhibited GRF-induced GH release <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> from adult animals, while it was synergistic with GRF <b>in</b> <b>aggregates</b> from developing animals. The effects of AII on GH release disappeared when aggregates were redispersed into single cells. However, in these single cell preparations AII strongly stimulated PRL release. In hemipituitaries from 1 -, 5 -, and 14 -day-old animals, AII also stimulated GH release, but no effect was seen in hemipituitaries from 25 -day-old and adult animals. These data indicate that AII has dual effects on GH release depending on the developmental stage of the animal and the hormonal environment. Furthermore, since no effect of AII was seen after redispersion of aggregates into single cells, both stimulatory and inhibitory effects seem to be based on an intercellular signaling system. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In this research, Light Reflection Method {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the effect of different moisture content on the migration behaviour of LNAPL <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin. Contamination of groundwater and soil raised the concern on the migration behaviour of LNAPL to aid in remediation research. Therefore, this research was conducted to study the migration behaviour of LNAPL in double porosity media of moisture content 27 %, 29 %, 31 % and 33 %. Photographic method {{was used to}} acquire images during the experiments. Image analysis technique was applied to acquire data of research using software Image-Pro Premier 9. 1. Based on the findings, LNAPL migrated at the fastest rate with the highest velocity <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin of 31 % moisture content due to larger inter-aggregate pore space when moisture content increased. Other than that, the area of LNAPL migration is the smallest <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin of 31 % moisture content due to higher residual saturation in the larger pore space. The final saturation of 31 % moisture content aggregated kaolin is the lowest due to the weaker capillary pressure in larger pore space. The mean intensity of the LNAPL migration is more uniform <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin of 31 % moisture content because disturbance on light intensity was greatly reduced with the shortest duration of migration. In conclusion, the effect of moisture content on migration behaviour of LNAPL <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin can be investigated using Light Reflection Method. Using photographic method, it has enabled the visualization on LNAPL migration behaviour <b>in</b> <b>aggregated</b> kaolin with data from image analysis...|$|R

In contrast, no difference in the stimulation of PRL release by ANG II was found.

Six locations, two each in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, were surveyed over 8 months to explore differences in the characteristics of <b>aggregates</b> found <b>in</b> habitats populated by clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Cras-sostrea virginica). Microaggregate ( 500 lm) concentrations, but peak concentrations of macroaggregates and microaggregates, mean size of particles, and volume fraction of aggregated material varied among the six shallow-water habitats.
