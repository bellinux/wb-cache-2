25|$|Some {{time between}} 2007 and 2008, Ruger added a heavier tapered barrel to the Mini series. The heavier barrel had an overall larger {{diameter}} with the barrel visibly becoming thicker {{in the final}} inches as the barrel approaches the <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> from the muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The SAR carbine variant, {{generally}} {{known as}} Glilon, is configured with a shorter barrel (332mm, 13.07in). Due to the shorter barrel a corresponding shorter piston and gas tube {{as well as}} a unique <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> are found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being in use with the Armored Corps until the late 2000s.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel assembly consists of the <b>gas</b> <b>block,</b> a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades and a slotted flash suppressor.|$|E

25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher {{operating}} pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|E
2500|$|The heavy, cold hammer-forged barrel is screwed {{into the}} {{receiver}} and {{is equipped with a}} slotted [...] "bird cage" [...] type flash suppressor that is also used to launch rifle grenades (using standard, live ammunition) or attach a knife bayonet (the bayonet is supported by a lug located {{at the base of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>block).</b> The rifled barrel has 6 right-hand grooves and the Swiss Army specification 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate is optimized for Swiss military GP 90 ammunition. An export-oriented barrel with a 178mm (1:7 in) twist rate is also available, designed to stabilize 5.56×45mm NATO rounds with the heavier SS109 and tracer projectiles.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} MSSR {{was created by}} removing the forward portion of the carry handle and attaching the Tri-mount directly {{to the top of}} the upper receiver. [...] The Tasco scope and scope rings were attached to the Tri-mount, which provided a lower scope-to-bore height. [...] The Delta HBAR cheek piece was no longer required and was removed. [...] The M16A1 front sight base was removed and replaced with a DPMS <b>gas</b> <b>block.</b> [...] The barrel was changed to a DPMS Ultra Match barrel with a 1 in 8" [...] RH twist, and the M16A1 stock and pistol grip were replaced with A2 versions.|$|E

2500|$|G36C (C="Compact", {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} [...] "Commando", a term trademarked by Colt Firearms for the CAR-15): This subcarbine {{model is a}} further development of the G36K. It has a shorter barrel than the G36K, and a four-prong open-type flash hider or a birdcage type flash hider. The extremely short barrel forced designers to move the <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> closer to the muzzle end and reduce {{the length of the}} gas piston operating rod. The handguard and stock were also shortened and the fixed carry handle (with optics) was replaced with a carrying handle with an integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. The dual optical sight found on the standard G36 and G36K models was replaced with a set of rail-mounted detachable iron sights that consist of a semi-shrouded front post and a flip-up rear sight with two apertures of different diameter. The short handguard has four accessory attachment points, one of which could be used for a vertical grip. The G36C was developed and produced in January 2001.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the <b>gas</b> <b>block.</b> The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] {{long sight}} radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the <b>gas</b> <b>block.</b> The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains apertures with settings [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with windage and elevation increments of 1.5 mrad or [...] at 300 m. For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|E

5000|$|Variations (1949-1958): Early Spike-style bayonet (1949) {{instead of}} blade-style. Spring-return firing pin was present on early models, {{and they did}} not have chrome bores (1949 - early 1951). The <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> had three changes: The first {{production}} stage <b>gas</b> <b>block,</b> used from 1949 through early 1950, was squared-off at a 90-degree angle. The second <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> production stage was instead cut at a 45-degree angle, seen on late 1950 to 1951 rifles. The third and final <b>gas</b> <b>block</b> stage, from 1952 through to 1956, was curved inward slightly toward the action.|$|E

30|$|The {{deficiency}} {{of a clear}} framework for awarding shale <b>gas</b> <b>blocks</b> has also hindered exploration and development. Pakistan’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MNPR) has drafted first Shale Gas Policy. This has to obtain an official endorsement from the Economic Co-Ordination Committee (ECC). The key question is then how to motivate Pakistan’s national oil companies to spend their capital in exploring and producing gas from shale gas reservoirs. How to justify to stakeholders or national oil companies that shale gas development is feasible. Exempting taxes on some extent, providing subsidies will positively support in meeting the demand of energy and may overcome these problems, concerning to shale gas production.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{collection}} worthy firearms {{that were}} military issue, civilian firearms {{based on their}} military versions are often subject to legal issues in various states. Many manufacturers do not even bother with making the bayonet lugs. The Assault weapons ban in 1994 issued that new firearms could not have bayonet lugs. In the context of that law, the National Rifle Association deemed telescoping stocks a [...] "cosmetic feature". Most AR uppers for example being sold today do not have bayonet lugs, because they are typically free-float quad-rail setups with hidden <b>gas</b> <b>blocks</b> and no way to attach a bayonet. In the United States, a bayonet lug is considered a cosmetic feature.|$|R
