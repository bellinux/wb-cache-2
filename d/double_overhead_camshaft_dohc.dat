It is basically the same engine used in the Audi B7 RS4, but is modified to use a dry sump lubrication system. It uses two chain-driven <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshafts</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> per cylinder bank, and utilises variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. The 4 wheel drive system is biased towards the rear; it sends 30% of its power to the front wheels and 70% to the rear.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} GS designs {{share common}} engine design elements of air-cooling, roller bearing crankshafts, two-valves per cylinder and <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshafts</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> operating directly on shim and bucket tappets. In 1980 {{the first major}} upgrading of the 750cc and 1000cc machines with 16-valve (four valves per cylinder) heads with the valves being actuated though short forked rockers, and the enlargement of the litre bike to 1100cc (actually 1074cc). The new heads incorporated Suzuki's Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) technology and machines sporting the new technology were designated as GSX models in Japan, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and many other markets, differentiating them from their two-valve per cylinder stable mates. In the Americas the GS code continued {{to be used for}} both four and two valve per cylinder machines. The 750 engine also received a plain bearing crankshaft and higher geared oil pump to increase oil pressure to the crank. The 8-valve 650cc engine also got plain bearing and marked the transition from two-stoke origins of the design and facilitated the move to air-oil cooling.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota TZ {{engine is}} a series of {{water-cooled}} inline four-cylinder gasoline engines from Toyota Motor Corporation. The engines feature dual <b>overhead</b> <b>camshafts</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> and 4 valves per cylinder. The supercharged 2TZ-FZE features an intercooler.|$|R
5000|$|In the SOHC design, the {{camshaft}} operates the valves directly, traditionally via a bucket tappet; or via an intermediary rocker arm. [...] SOHC cylinder heads are generally {{less expensive to}} manufacture than <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> cylinder heads. Timing belt replacement can be easier since there are fewer camshaft drive sprockets {{that need to be}} aligned during the replacement procedure.|$|E

50|$|The first Cosworth-designed {{cylinder}} head was for SCA series; {{with a single}} overhead camshaft (SOHC) reverse-flow configuration, similar to the Coventry Climax FWE engine. A real success was achieved with the next gear-driven <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> four-valve FVA in 1966, when Cosworth, with a help from Chapman, convinced Ford to purchase {{the rights to the}} design, and sign a development contract - including an eight-cylinder version. This resulted in the DFV, which dominated Formula One for many years.|$|E
50|$|The 6.0-litre <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC),</b> 48-valve W12 engined {{version was}} {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a limited-edition model, with just 500 units planned to be produced; around 330 were slated for sale in Saudi Arabia, with the remainder sold in Europe. Some of those W12 Touaregs were sold in China, but the number of sold is unknown. No sales in the United States were made. Eventually, the W12 model became an ordinary model without any production restrictions. It is estimated to reach 100 km/h in 5.9 seconds.|$|E
50|$|These engines {{feature a}} {{light-weight}} cast-iron semi-closed deck engine block with an aluminum cylinder head.

Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of modern automobile engines place the camshaft on the cylinder head in an overhead camshaft (OHC) design. There {{may be one}} or two camshafts in the cylinder head; a single camshaft design is called single overhead camshaft (SOHC). A design with two camshafts per cylinder head is called <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC).</b> Note that the camshafts are counted per cylinder head, so a V engine with one camshaft in each of its two-cylinder heads is still an SOHC design, and a V engine with two camshafts per cylinder head is DOHC, or informally a [...] "quad cam" [...] engine.|$|E
50|$|The engines {{were all}} {{inline-four}} types, derived from {{those used in}} the outgoing 124 range, with a cast iron cylinder block and aluminium alloy cylinder head. Initially the 131 was offered only with pushrod valve gear, which offered the innovation of being the worldwide first engine with OHV valve gear and a belt driven camshaft. Only later in the model’s life came the well known <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> engines which used a toothed timing belt. Fuel supply was via a single Weber ADF twin-choke carburettor, fed from a trunk mounted steel fuel tank. Traditional contact breaker ignition systems were used, usually with Marelli distributors.|$|E

5000|$|Cosworth {{solidified}} {{its association}} with Ford in 1969, by developing a <b>double</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (<b>DOHC)</b> 16-valve inline four-cylinder engine for road use in the Ford Escort. As Keith Duckworth was busy designing and developing the DFV, the project was assigned to Mike Hall, who created the 1601 cc BDA on the Kent block for homologation purposes. The camshafts were driven by a toothed belt developed for Fiat 124, hence the name BDA, literally meaning [...] "Belt Drive, A type". It was designed for FIA Group 2 and Group 4 on either rallying or touring car racing purpose. The nominal homologation at 1601 cc capacity meant that BDA-engined cars competed in what was usually the top class (1600 cc and up) so were eligible for overall victories rather than class wins.|$|E
