In general, the interest of policy makers in combinatorial auctions is justified by the laboratory data. When value complementarities are present, package bidding yields improved performance. We find clear differences among the combinatorial auction formats both in terms of efficiency and seller revenue, however. Notably, the combinatorial clock provides the highest revenue. The FCC's <b>flexible</b> <b>package</b> bidding format performed worse than the alternatives, {{which is one of the}} main reasons why it was not implemented. (JEL D 44, H 82) ...|$|R
