40|$|This is {{the peer}} {{reviewed}} {{version of the}} following article: Microenvironmental hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activating its cancer stem cell compartment. Gut 64. 12 (2015) : 1921 - 1935 and which has been published in final form at [URL] The tumour stroma/microenvironment not only provides structural support for tumour development, but more importantly it provides cues to cancer stem cells (CSCs) that regulate their self-renewal and metastatic potential. This is certainly true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), where tumour-associated fibroblasts, pancreatic stellate cells and immune cells create an abundant paracrine niche for CSCs via microenvironment-secreted factors. Thus understanding the role that tumour stroma cells play in PDAC development and CSC biology is of utmost importance. DESIGN: Microarray analyses, tumour microarray immunohistochemical assays, in vitro co-culture experiments, recombinant protein treatment approaches and in vivo intervention studies were performed to understand {{the role that the}} immunomodulatory cationic antimicrobial peptide 18 /LL- 37 (hCAP- 18 /LL- 37) plays in PDAC biology. RESULTS: We found that hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 was strongly expressed in the stroma of advanced primary and secondary PDAC tumours and is secreted by immune cells of the stroma (eg, tumour-associated macrophages) in response to tumour growth factor-β 1 and particularly CSC-secreted Nodal/ActivinA. Treatment of pancreatic CSCs with recombinant LL- 37 increased pluripotency-associated gene expression, self-renewal, invasion and tumourigenicity via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR 2) - and P 2 X purinoceptor 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R) -dependent mechanisms, which could be reversed by inhibiting these receptors. Importantly, in a genetically engineered mouse model of K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumourigenesis, we also showed that tumour formation was inhibited by either reconstituting these mice with bone marrow from cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (ie, murine homologue of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37) knockout mice or by pharmacologically inhibiting FPR 2 and P 2 X 7 R. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 represents a previously unrecognised PDAC microenvironment factor that plays a critical role in pancreatic CSC-mediated tumourigenesis.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the {{relationship}} between a rural branding strategy and a local economic development action through the case study of Territoris Serens in El Lluçan <b>es</b> (Catalonia, <b>Spain).</b> This initiative is framed within the process of economic restructuring which has taken place in rural areas in recent years, with local economic activity moving away from production and towards consumption. In this context, strategies of marketing, branding and communication take on a crucial role in making rural areas more visible and facilitating their economic diversification. Through the analysis of documentary sources and the results of a focus group, the article shows how the place branding strategy implemented in this case transcends the traditional functions of facilitating the promotion and marketing of place, becoming a fundamental part of a bottom-up process of local economic development and taking on a notable role in the internal, collective definition of a competitive territorial identity, the revaluation of endogenous local resources and the promotion of community-based rural development. We thus posit that the interplay between processes of locally defining place identity and economic development strategies leads to a restructuring of local economic activity in ways that serve local communities and values, thus contributing to sustainable, long-term development...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} explore {{clinical}} and care-related 'factors associated with fulfilling cancer patients' preference for home death across four countries: Belgium (BE), the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES).</b> Methods: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken from 2009 to 2011 via representative networks of general practitioners (GPs). The study included all patients aged 18 and over who had died of cancer and whose home death preference and place of death were known by the GP. Factors associated with meeting home death preference were tested using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among 2, 048 deceased patients, preferred and actual place of death was known in 42. 6 percent of cases. Home death preference met ranged from 65. 5 to 90. 9 percent. Country-specific factors included older age in BE, and decision-making capacity and being female in the NL. GPs' provision of palliative care was positively associated with meeting home death preference. Odds ratios (ORs) were: BE: 9. 9 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 3. 7 - 26. 6); NL: 9. 7 (2. 4 - 39. 9); and IT: 2. 6 (1. 2 - 5. 5).

40|$|P>Background Peristomal skin {{problems}} are common and are treated {{by a variety}} of health professionals. Clear and consistent communication among these professionals is therefore particularly important. The Ostomy Skin Tool (OST) is a new assessment instrument for the extent and severity of peristomal skin conditions. Formal tests of reliability and validity are necessary for its use in clinical practice, research, and education. Objectives To estimate inter- and intra nurse assessment variability of the OST and validity by comparison to a 'gold standard' (GS) defined by an expert panel. Methods Thirty photographs of peristomal skin were presented twice to 20 ostomy care nurses - 10 from Denmark (DK) and 10 from <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES)</b> - to determine intra- and inter nurse assessment variability. The same photographs were presented to an international group of experts (dermatologist and ostomy care nurses), to establish a GS for comparison and validation of the results. Results A high intra-nurse assessment agreement, kappa = 0 center dot 84, was found with no differences in the intra-nurse assessments from the two groups of nurses (DK and ES). The inter-nurse assessment agreement was 'moderate to good', kappa = 0 center dot 54, with the agreement between the experts higher, kappa = 0 center dot 70. A high correlation between the scores from the nurses and the GS were seen in {{the lower part of the}} two scales [Discoloration, Erosion, Tissue overgrowth (DET) score < 7) ]. Conclusion The study supported the validity of the OST. It is suggested that a categorical scale can be used to illustrate the severity of the DET scores...|$|R
40|$|Early {{nutrition}} programming as an {{origin of}} obesity is well acknowledged, {{but to what}} extent is this concept communicated to parents? In five European countries, UK, Finland (FI), Germany (DE), Hungary (HU) and <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> a total of 130 stand alone leaflets and 161 articles from parenting magazines providing information on feeding of healthy infants aged 0 - 12 months were identified and screened for nutrition programming statements. Obesity was mentioned in 8. 5 % (54 / 638) of the statements, and was the fourth most frequent outcome after allergy (20. 7 %), risk of infections (15. 5 %) and growth and development (11. 4 %). A temporal prognosis was given in 39 % of obesity related statements, 6 % referring to short- (15 years) duration of effects. So advice on obesity focuses oil the intrinsic long-term perspective of programming in contrary to other surveyed health-outcomes where only 8 % considered a lifelong approach. The major programming related behaviour concerned breast-feeding compared to formula and complementary feeding with meaningful differences concerning the recommended duration: for ES and HU the predominant advice was for exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months, for DE exclusive breast-feeding for 4 - 6 months and for UK and FI breast-feeding without further specification. In summary, statements relating to the programming of later obesity have been partially integrated into feeding information in five European countries. These Countries have slightly different breastfeeding recommendations, but consistently refer to the preventive potential of breastfeeding in general. This is important as obesity and its resulting morbidity are of increasing public health concern in developed countries...|$|R

Zebrafish experiments were performed partly in Germany at the Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, and partly in Spain at AZTI Zebrafish Facility (REGA Number <b>ES</b> 489010006105; Derio, <b>Spain).</b> The fish embryos that {{were used for the}} experiments in Germany were from a wildtype zebrafish stock maintained at the Fraunhofer IME institute (Aachen) for more than 20  years, with original stocks obtained in 1992 from West Aquarium GmbH (Bad Lauterberg, Germany). The fish embryos used for experiments in Spain were from a wildtype stock that were bred at the AZTI facility more than 10  years ago. Zebrafish maintenance and egg production was according to standard procedures and is described in detail in a previous study [15]. The embryos were selected visually using a binocular microscope and only fertilized and normally developed eggs undergoing division and showing no obvious irregularities during cleavage (e.g., asymmetry, vesicle formation) or injuries of the chorion were selected [2]. Selected fertilized eggs of the same cell stage were placed in embryo medium prepared according to ISO standards (294  mg/L CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O, 123.3  mg/L MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, 63  mg/L NaHCO 3, 5.5  mg/L KCl) [33] at 27  °C and were used in further testing. The use of zebrafish was in accordance with the animal welfare act. Namely, zebrafish embryos and larvae below 120  h post fertilization (hpf) are still feeding on their yolk [34], and hence are not considered animals, so that no animal test authorization is required according to European legislation (EU Directive, 2010 / 63 /EU); Real Decreto 53 / 2013 in Spain and TierSchG (Tierschutzgesetz) and the respective regulation TierSchVersV (Tierschutz-Versuchstierverordnung) in Germany. All experiments were terminated at 120  hpf and the larvae were immediately euthanized by prolonged immersion in a solution of benzocaine in ethanol. The used term “larvae” refers to hatched embryos up to 120  hpf that do not feed externally yet and are still using up the yolk-sac reserves.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Follicular {{lymphoma}} (FL) is {{the second}} most common type of lymphoid cancer in Western Europe. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the cost utility of rituximab-bendamustine treatment compared with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) treatment as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced FL in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of rituximab-bendamustine compared with R-CHOP as first-line treatment for patients with advanced FL in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Transitions between health states (progression-free, including induction and maintenance; first relapse; second relapse; and death) were allowed for the patient cohort in 4 -week-long cycles. Clinical data for the extrapolation of progression-free survival curves were obtained from randomized trials. Mortality rates and utilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs (€, 2013) included drug costs (ex-factory prices with mandatory deductions), disease management costs and adverse event-associated costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % annual rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using 10, 000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess the model robustness. RESULTS: Treatment and administration costs during the induction phase were higher for rituximab-bendamustine (€ 17, 671) than for R-CHOP (€ 11, 850). At the end of the 25 -year period, the rituximab-bendamustine first-line strategy had a total cost of € 68, 357 compared with € 69, 528 for R-CHOP. Health benefits were higher for rituximab-bendamustine treatment (10. 31 QALYs) than for R-CHOP treatment (9. 82 QALYs). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab-bendamustine was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP in 53. 4 % of the simulations. CONCLUSION: First-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine in FL patients was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP; it showed cost savings and higher health benefits for the Spanish NHS.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with the choice of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) therapy {{at the time of}} intensification of antidiabetic treatment across four European countries. Methods: For T 2 DM patients from the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES)</b> (2007 - 2011) and United Kingdom (UK) (2008 - 2012) antidiabetic drug prescription/dispensing records and patient characteristics were obtained from electronic health-care records. Oral monotherapy was defined as 1 st line, oral dual therapy as 2 nd line, andgt; 2 oral treatments or oral combined with an injectable as 3 rd line and injectables only as 4 th line treatment. Treatment intensification was defined as starting a higher line of treatment. Comedication, comorbidities, clinical parameters and other {{factors associated with}} treatment choice were identified using multivariable relative risk estimation by Poisson regression with robust error variance. Findings: In the study period 485, 120 patients, i. e. 79 % of the treated T 2 DM population underwent treatment intensification. Changes in treatment choice were clearly visible over the study period, such as decline of thiazolidinedione (TZD) use (NL, ES, UK), and increase of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP 4 i) use (NL, ES, UK) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonist (GLP- 1 ra) use (UK). For 1 st line treatment advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with SU (all countries), whereas high BMI was inversely associated with SU in UK and ES. For 2 nd line advanced age was associated with metformin + SU (all countries) and renal comorbidity with SU + dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP 4 i) in UK and NL. High BMI was associated with metformin + thiazolidinedione (TZD) in UK and ES, and with metformin + DPP 4 i (UK). For 3 rd line advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with SU + insulin (NL, ES, UK). HbA 1 c andge; 8. 5 % was positively and high BMI inversely associated with any 3 rd line combination containing insulin. For 4 th line treatment women were more likely to receive GLP- 1 ra than men in UK and ES. Implications: The results suggest that the main factors driving treatment choice at any stage of intensification were age, HbA 1 c, BMI, renal and cardiac morbidity, and prior treatment history. These drivers were consistent with guidelines and contra-indications for specific medications. Differences between countries were generally consistent with, but not solely attributable to differences in local guidelines and reimbursement policies. </p...|$|R
40|$|España ha sido durante el año 2013 el país líder europeo en oferta de cursos MOOC y se encuentra en una posición puntera a nivel mundial en el número de cursos masivos ofertados en 2014. Esta prolífica actividad se está trasladando al mundo divul-gativo y científico en forma de entradas en blogs, redes sociales y páginas web, así co-mo en forma de artículos científicos y libros que intentan analizar el movimiento desde diferentes aproximaciones metodológicas. Hasta el momento, no se ha analizado la re-percusión bibliométrica del impacto del movimiento MOOC en la comunidad científica española, por lo que el objetivo de esta investigación, es realizar un estudio bibliométri-co de la repercusión científica en forma de artículo o libro de investigación en revistas y editoriales españolas durante el periodo comprendido entre enero de 2010 y junio de 2014.

40|$|This thesis {{will show}} how patents {{policies}} {{can help the}} commercialization of inventions in Europe. Our study is mainly based on statistical material contained in the European Patent Office’s (EPO) database of published granted patents. Our study covers 407 granted patents {{in the field of}} chemistry and handling & processing in a one period year starting on 2007 - 12 - 24 and ending on 2008 - 12 - 26. Given the scope of data analysis, we found a tendency to limit the patents post (after) grant to a few states in Europe, mainly to Germany (DE), France (FR), Great Britain (GB), Italy (IT), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> The Netherlands (NL) and Sweden (SE). This limitation in time and designated states is an indication that the markets in these states are the most important ones in Europe concerning the fields of chemistry and handling & processing for the applicant of the patent (e. g. the proprietor). In more than 70 % of the number of granted patents post grant in our empirical study DE, FR and GB are the designated states. But we also found that in several of the granted patents in our thesis, Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Switzerland (CH) and Finland (FI) are designated post grant. The numbers of designated states, post grant, in the scope of our thesis are higher compared with earlier studies applying the same method. For example Markus Reitzig’s empirical study that was made in 2004 uses 813 granted European patents, where the designation of DE, FR and GB was more significant and only 4 - 5 states on average were designated. It is an indication that the European market has extended the last 10 years within the fields of our study. The uniqueness of our empirical study comes from the survey of each of the 407 granted patents when it was filed at the European Patent Office (EPO) and after grant and publishing (post grant), i. e. {{at the beginning of the}} life cycle of the patent. As far as we know no earlier studies did so. Concerning our sample of applications for a European patent, the rational is the following. When the application is filed at EPO are all possible states designated, but post grant of the patent only a few state remains. Concerning the selection of the field of patenting, our consideration of data singularises chemistry and handling & processing. Clearly in the field of chemistry we found a marked incremental tendency for the transfer of patents rights. The transfer itself may be an indicator of a change either of industrial process toward R&D or a strategy toward patent policies in this specific field. The thesis tries consequently to evaluate if the EU-patent system will ease the commercialization of inventions in chemistry and handling´& processing in Europe. Especially for SMEs the EU-patent should facilitate a quicker and cheaper process. A general opinion assumes that the European patent application is too expensive for small companies. The process of establishing EU-patent was initiated 30 years ago and it will last another 5 years before it is fully possible to filing. Obviously, legal and political matters are not completely solved but that is not the direct concern of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Research: Resent {{research}} on effects of social origin on class and education in 20 th century Switzerland {{has not only}} demonstrated the persistence of these effects (Pfeffer, 2008; Falcon, 2012; Falcon, 2013) but some results suggest even increasing effects of social origin for the youngest cohorts (Jann and Combet, 2012; Jann and Seiler, 2014), especially on education (for a short overview, cf., Falcon and Joye, 2015). This empirical evidence directly contradict the modernization thesis which predicts constant reductions of effects of social origin {{over the course of}} processes which are summarized under the label of modernization (eg., Lipset and Zetterberg, 1959; Kerr, 1962; Blau and Duncan, 1967). The importance of these results from Switzerland is, however, difficult to assess, because, to my knowledge, occupational mobility in Switzerland has never and educational mobility has only once (Pfeffer, 2008) been studied comparatively. The two basic research questions of this paper are therefore: How do the effects of social origin on education and class found in Switzerland compare to those from other Western European countries? And: can the analyses in this paper confirm the increasing effects of social origin suggested by some results for the youngest birth-cohorts in Switzerland? Data and Methodological Approach: To investigate these questions, a harmonized dataset is used with data on nine countries: Switzerland (CH), Germany (DE), Denmark (DK), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> France (FR), Great Britain (GB), Ireland (IE), Netherlands (NL), and Norway (NO). Data is drawn from the 2011 EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (Eurostat, 2015) which includes a module on intergenerational transmission of disadvantages, and from the rounds 4 7 of the European Social Survey (ESS, 2008; ESS, 2010; ESS, 2012; ESS, 2014). For 63 897 respondents aged 35 60 the necessary information on their own and theirs parents’ occupation and education is available. These observations are grouped into three birth cohorts (the year used as label in parentheses) : 1950 - 59 (1955), 1960 - 69 (1965), and 1970 - 79 (1975). The two main dimensions used in the analyses are class and education. To avoid empty cells, both of them are measured with only three categories. For class, we collapse the original EGP-scheme (Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero, 1983) into three classes: The service class (I & II) becomes the upper class, non-manual employees (III), self-employed (IVa,c) and skilled workers (V & VI) the middle class, and semi- and unskilled workers (VIIa) as well as farmers (IVc) and agricultural workers (VIIb) the lower class. In order to fully utilize the full richness of the data, homemaker is included as a forth class to the class-scheme of the mothers. Similarly, the ISCED categories for education have been collapsed into categories for low, intermediate, and tertiary education. The applied methodological approach to estimate the effects of social origin builds on an approach first used by Jann and Combet (2012) and evaluated and described in more detail by Jann and Seiler (2014). The basic idea is simple: If origin strongly affects destination, the knowledge of origin strongly improves the prediction of destination. In turn, the improvement of the prediction of destination by knowing both parents’ education or class, measured by the Proportional Reduction of Errors (PRE), {{can be seen as a}} measure for the effect of origin on class or education of the respondent. In practice, this involves three steps: predict destination using a model without origin, predict destination using a model with origin and assess the improvement of the prediction by calculating the PRE conditional on each country and birth cohort. Contrary to the procedure described by Jann and Seiler (2014), a GMM-estimator and not a bootstrap procedure is used in to obtain valid standard errors. Preliminary Results and Outlook: Figure 1 shows the estimated effect of social origin on class and education over the three birth cohorts, separately for men and women and for each of the nine countries. Additionally, each plot shows the estimated differences between the three birth cohorts. Estimates and differences whose spikes do not cross the zero-line can be said to be statistically significant different from zero. For class, the general picture depicts persistence of effect across birth cohorts. There are two exceptions: Effects of parents’ classes on German women’s class have risen significantly from the first to the later birth cohorts; the same is true for French men. Apart from that, no increasing (but also: no decreasing) effects of social origin on class can be found. The results are more diverse for effects of parents’ on respondent’s educational attainment. On the left side of the figure, we can see that effects of social origin are relatively high in Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the results show significantly increasing effects for German women and Swiss men. Rising effects of social origin can also be found for Danish women when we compare the youngest with the middle cohort. The opposite is only true for Norwegian women: Here, the effects decrease strongly and significantly from the first to the second before it insignificantly increases again. In summary, the present paper mainly draws a picture that is in line with the {{research on}} educational inequality and social mobility (cf., Breen and Jonsson, 2005). I. e., it depicts persisting effects of social origin. However, results deviating from this general picture do not exhibit decreasing effects of social origin, but increasing trends. The analyses presented in this paper support – at least for men – the findings from Switzerland suggesting increasing effects of social origin on educational attainment. They also show that this is not the normal case in Western European countries but that it is not the only exception either. Comparative research needs comparable data and comparable data always come to the prize that they are badly adapted to some local specificities. The present analyses should, therefore, be repeated with local data but comparable method. Comparable data are, on the other hand, the only way to see a specific result within a broader picture. And they can point to phenomena that need closer attainted – and increasing effects of social origin is definitely such a case...|$|R
