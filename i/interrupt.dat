40|$|<b>Interrupts</b> and in {{particular}} precise <b>interrupts</b> constitute {{an integral part of}} all computer architectures. Implementing precise <b>interrupts</b> can substantially inhibit the performance of computers. To gain some insight into the problem, we divide common <b>interrupts</b> into four classes, and examine the cost of implementing precise <b>interrupts.</b> Two of these classes, external-critical and external-error, can be implemented cheaply on a pipelined processor, with little or no impact on performance. We propose that <b>interrupts</b> be implemented imprecisely, except during debugging, of a third class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-error <b>interrupts.</b> Finally, we introduced some techniques {{that can be used to}} cheaply implement precise <b>interrupts</b> for the fourth class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-critical <b>interrupts,</b> but may not apply generally. While the central concern is precision, or lack thereof, we also deal with several peripheral issues that arise when implementing <b>interrupts</b> on aggressive implementation [...] ...|$|R

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive <b>interrupt</b> system, allowing players to <b>interrupt</b> the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
