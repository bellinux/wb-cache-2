50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> (Palomena prasina) is {{a shield}} bug {{of the family}} Pentatomidae. It may also be {{referred}} to as a green stink bug, particularly outside of Britain, although the name green stink bug more appropriately belongs to the larger North American stink bug, Acrosternum hilare. The adult <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> ranges in the colour of their backs from bright green to bronze, without any substantial markings. Green shield bugs are a very common shield bug throughout Europe, including the British Isles, and are found in a large variety of habitats, including gardens. They have been found as far north as 63° N latitude.|$|E

Beetles and flies, especially syrphids, collect mainly pollen, whereas bees visited the flowers for both pollen and nectar, and tachinid flies and Lepidoptera primarily collect nectar.Especially at low altitudes, small native solitary bees and flies are common visitors. [...] More specific survey was made by Mark & Steve (2013), native butterflies of New Zealand have been feeding on nectar of Veronica spp. As shown in the laboratory test, H. salicifolia flowers significantly increased the fitness of female butterflies. The Australasian <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bugs</b> often sit their egg shells {{on a wide variety}} of native and naturalised trees and shrubs including koromiko. Adults and juveniles of Australasian <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bugs</b> feed by inserting a stylet into the plant and then suck plant sap and berries. As for diseases, leaf spot and downy mildew may occur in poor condition.|$|R

50|$|Nezara viridula, {{commonly}} known as the southern green stink bug (USA), Southern <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> (UK) or green vegetable bug (Australia and New Zealand), is a plant-feeding stink bug. Although believed to have originated in Ethiopia, it can now be found around the world. Because of its preference for certain species of legumes, such as beans and soybeans, it is an economically important pest on such crops.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the bright}} green shield bugs appear in May, having hibernated as imagos during the winter. They fatten {{for a month}} and then mate in June. The imago's {{coloration}} changes over the summer months from green to greenish browns even bronze , after which the life cycle will end. Mating is back-to-back. The female lays her eggs in hexagonal batches of 25 to 30, and a single female will lay three to four batches. After the eggs hatch, the <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> enter a larval stage (which is really their first nymphal stage) where, in general, they remain together in sibling communities. This is made possible by the excretion of an aggregation pheromone. In case of danger, another pheromone is released which causes dispersal. The larval stage is followed by four more nymphal stages as well as moulting between each one. The <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> displays different colouration during each nymphal stage, light brown, black or green-black, and in the final stage, the imago, is bright green with short wings. Usually the imago stage is reached in September, with hibernation occurring in November.|$|E
50|$|Phasia {{hemiptera}} is a tachinid fly {{found throughout}} Northern and Southern Europe. It is a strongly sexually dimorphic species, males being more colourful with curved patterned wings. Like most tachinid flies, the female lays her eggs on other insects, the larvae then develop inside the living host, devouring it and eventually killing it. Its main hosts are the forest bug Pentatoma rufipes in the spring, and the <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> <b>bug</b> Palomena prasina in the autumn.|$|E
