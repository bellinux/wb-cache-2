500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

I understand {{there is going to be}} a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls. Gish later noted that [...] " [...] gave me a tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer." [...] Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was kind of much like [...] character to appreciate that." ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2012, Gettin' Rad Productions, the {{production}} company owned by Adam Scott and his wife, Naomi Scott, optioned the movie rights to Downtown Owl. “It’s lovely and moving and funny. We <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it’s</b> {{a really great}} story about people that I relate to but also small enough {{that it would make}} a good first film out of the gate for us," [...] Adam Scott was quoted in The Hollywood Reporter. However, no further updates on the film project have been released since then.|$|R
500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was horrible. It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be nice to have}} an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Nyoy Volante {{released}} [...] "Someday" [...] as {{the first}} single from his album In You. Despite having a feud with Nina on the estafa case, {{he came up with}} reviving the song. In an interview, he stated [...] "We weren’t thinking of anything, not even about Nina, when we did my version. MCA <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it’s</b> a nice song and they liked how my version turned out. I did not push for it to become the album’s single". He further said that he actually wrote [...] "Someday" [...] for his album before giving it to Nina.|$|R
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time}} on September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was just incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be fun to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} of co-executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz, {{he came up with}} a new idea. Spotnitz was inspired by an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, called [...] "The Night the Roof Fell In", in which the characters of Rob and Laura Petrie tell different versions of a fight they have had. Gilligan said of the idea, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a cool way to tell a story." [...] With two versions of the same story taking up much of the episode, Gilligan knew {{that he would have to}} keep the plot simple and settled on a vampire story, that everyone would easily understand. Both Mulder and Scully's version of the episode were filmed back to back, utilizing the [...] "exact same sets and camera angles". The RV park that was featured in the episode was formerly the site of a sawmill that had previously been used in the fourth season episode [...] "Gethsemane" [...] that had burned down.|$|E
500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our favorite thing of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. [...] "Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the greatest thing ever," [...] he remarked.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time for my character to go". Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell's last season, because he is [...] "a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell’s swan song".

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and I took him to Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé {{was trying to be}} [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Michael" [...] {{was written}} by series {{developer}} and executive producer Greg Daniels, his 10th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Paul Feig, marking his 14th credit for the series. On June 28, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the seventh season of The Office would be Steve Carell's last. He had previously announced this while being interviewed on BBC Radio. [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time for my character to go," [...] Carell was quoted as saying. In January 2011, it was announced that Carell would exit the show early, four episodes {{before the end of the}} season. A few weeks after this announcement came the news that Will Ferrell, who previously starred alongside Carell in , had signed on to appear in a four-episode arc as a Dunder Mifflin branch manager who temporarily takes Michael Scott's position in Scranton. To help ease the transition, Ferrell appeared in Carell's final episodes as well as one additional episode after he departs.|$|E
500|$|The maniacal {{schoolmaster}} was {{voiced by}} Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie's voice. Backing vocals were {{performed by a}} range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] and [...] "Waiting for the Worms" [...] was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Toni Tennille. [...] Ezrin's suggestion to release [...] "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" [...] as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters was opposed {{to the idea of}} releasing a single at all, but became more receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix of the song. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic about the idea, saying: [...] "I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – [...] "We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control..."

500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be fun to do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|E
500|$|After {{agreeing to}} rework the {{material}} that Ralbovsky had found so objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. [...] Both drummers, they later replaced Mason {{on most of the}} album's songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. [...] Some of the drum parts were also performed by drum machines. During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboard player, Richard Wright, if he too could contribute to the project. [...] A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1979, and there were certain legal obstacles to his return, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in. [...] Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence [...] "would make us stronger legally and musically". [...] He was therefore employed as a paid musician, on a weekly wage of $11,000, but his contributions were minimal. [...] Most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, along with adding several vocal harmonies. The keyboardist also performed a solo in [...] "On the Turning Away", which was discarded, according to Wright, [...] "not because they didn't like it...they <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> didn't fit." [...] Gilmour later said: [...] "Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. [...] In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger …" [...] Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who reflected: [...] "I'd deny that I was catatonic. [...] I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. [...] At some point, he made some sort of apology." [...] Mason did concede, however, that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
