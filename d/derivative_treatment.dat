The contents of saccharin and cyclamate mostly exceed the National Standard levels. The consumption of hwa-mei reduced because consummers want to avoid the exceeding sugar and salt for health. In order to control the quality, {{it is necessary for}} establishing a rapid method for quality analysis of hwa-mei. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recognized to be a rapid technique for the food analysis. This study is to investigate the feasibility of analyzing hwa-mei quality including titratable acidity、total soluble solids、salinity and saccharin by NIRS. The best statistical mathematical treatments for calibration equations by NIT were summarized as follows : (1) for the calibration equation of titratable acidity, the step-up regression without <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 10 nm; (2) for the calibration equations of total soluble soilds and salinity, the step-up regression with 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 10 nm;and (3) for the calibration equation of saccharin, the step-up regression with 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 8 nm. The calibration curves by NIT for titratable acidity、total soluble solids and salinity using extract solution diluted 25 times had better prediction result than that diluted 81 times. Comparing the prediction results of the calibration curves by NIT and NIR, the prediction by NIT is better than that by NIR. The accuracy for the total soluble soilds and salinity was better than that for the two others. If using RPD assessment, the predicting ability of the calibration curves for total soluble soilds was classified to 〝Good〞grade and could be used as 〝Quality control〞, and the predicting ability of the calibration curves for salinity was classified to 〝Superior〞grade and could be used as 〝As good as reference〞. 在臺灣，話梅是受消費者喜愛的蜜餞產品之一，然而在製造時往往添加過量的食鹽及人工甜味劑之糖精和賽克拉美等，其中糖精和賽克拉美之添加量往往超過國家的用量標準。又由於國人對健康的重視，紛紛走向避免攝取過高的糖分及鹽分之生活習慣，因此造成消費者對話梅之購買慾大減。所以為了消費者食的健康、提昇消費者對話梅品質的信心及對進出口話梅的品質管制，故需準確、快速的品質檢測方法對話梅產品進行檢測。而近紅外線光譜技術 (NIRS) 為近年來公認快速檢驗之方法，故本研究針對以 (NIRS) 應用於分析話梅品質包括鹽度、可滴定酸度、可溶性固形物及糖精含量之可行性加以探討。 於製備穿透光譜檢量線之最適條件為 (1) 可滴定酸度檢量線： 所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (10 nm 為間距) 光譜範圍，配合 step-up 迴歸方法和光譜不經微分處理的條件；(2) 可溶性固形物及 鹽度檢量線：所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (10 nm 為間距) 光譜 範圍，配合 step-up 迴歸方法和光譜經一次微分處理的條件；(3) 糖 精檢量線：所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (8 nm 為間距) 光譜範圍 ，配合step-up 迴歸方法和光譜經一次微分處理的條件。 針對以稀釋 81 倍及 25 倍的話梅萃取液建立之可滴定酸度、可 溶性固形物和鹽度之穿透光譜檢量線而言， 25 倍稀釋者之預測效果較 稀釋 81 倍者為佳。 比較穿透掃瞄及反射掃瞄兩種方式所建立之檢量線其預測效果， 不管是那種成分皆以穿透式掃瞄所建立之檢量線的預測效果比反射式 掃瞄所建立者為佳，其中又以所建立之鹽度和可溶性固形物檢量線之 預測效果最佳。若以 RPD 評估方法評估，其可溶性固形物檢量線達 〝Good〞級，表示可用於話梅〝Quality control〞之用；鹽度檢量線 達〝Superior〞級，可做話梅〝As good as reference〞之用...|$|E

40|$|Calculating {{derivatives}} of {{spectral data}} by the Savitzky–Golay (SG) numerical algorithm {{is often used}} as a preliminary preprocessing step to resolve overlapping signals, enhance signal properties, and suppress unwanted spectral features that arise due to nonideal instrument and sample properties. Addressing these issues, {{a study of the}} simulated and measured infrared data by partial least-squares regression has been conducted. The simulated data sets were modeled by considering a range of undesired chemical and physical spectral anomalies and variations that can occur in a measured spectrum, such as baseline variations, noise, and scattering effects. The study has demonstrated the importance of the optimization of the SG parameters during the conversion of spectra into derivative form, specifically window size and polynomial order of the fitting curve. A specific optimal window size is associated with an exact component of the system being estimated, and this window size does not necessarily apply for some other component present in the system. Since the optimization procedure can be time-consuming, as a rough guideline spectral noise level can be used for assessment of window size.

To assess the relevance of this finding for clinical cross-resistance, we used an analytical model based on the relation of in vivo treatment response parameters (fever, parasite and symptom clearance) to a single reference drug with in vitro drug sensitivity data of several other drugs. Artemisinin (R 0. 554; P 0. 009) and mefloquine (R 0. 615; P 0. 002) in vitro drug sensitivities were equally well reflected in the in vivo treatment response to artemisinin, thereby suggesting the clinical relevance of in vitro cross-sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{advances}} on fine taxonomic discrimination in microorganisms, namely using molecular biology tools, some groups remain particularly problematic. Fine taxonomy of green algae, a widely distributed group in freshwater ecosystems, remains a challenge, especially for coccoid forms. In this paper, we propose {{the use of}} the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as part of a polyphasic approach to identify and classify coccoid green microalgae (mainly order Sphaeropleales), using triplicated axenic cultures. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique was tested to reproducibility of IR spectra of the biological material, a primary requirement to achieve good discrimination of microalgal strains. Spectral window selection was also tested, in conjunction with the first <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> of spectra, to determine which regions of the spectrum provided better separation and clustering of strains. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and hierarchical clusters (HCA), demonstrated a correct discrimination and classification of closely related strains of chlorophycean coccoid microalgae, with respect to currently accepted classifications. FTIR-ATR was highly reproducible, and provided an excellent discrimination at the strain level. The best separation was achieved by analyzing the spectral windows of 1500 - 1200 cm(- 1) and 900 - 675 cm(- 1), which differs from those used in previously studies for the discrimination of broad algal groups, and excluding spectral regions related to storage compounds, which were found to give poor discrimination. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analyses have positioned the strains tested into clades correctly, reproducing their taxonomic orders and families. This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR has great potential to complement classical approaches for fine taxonomy of coccoid green microalgae, though a careful spectrum region selection is needed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of cell-free derivatives from Bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in wound therapy. METHODS: hMSCs {{have been shown to}} play an important role in wound therapy. The present study sought to compare efficacy of hMSCs and cell-free derivatives of hMSCs, which may be clinically more relevant as they are easier to prepare, formulate and transport. hMSCs were isolated from human bone marrow and cultured. Multi lineage differentiation of hMSCs was performed to confirm their identity. The ability of hMSCs to migrate was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo migration assays. Cell lysates and conditioned medium concentrate was prepared from hMSCs (see Methods for details). Wounds were induced in mice and wound areas were measure before and after cell and cell-free <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment.</b> RNA and proteins were extracted from the skin and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: Co-culture of hMSCs with keratinocytes resulted in increased expression of CXCL- 12 (SDF 1) and ENA 78 (CXCL- 5) in the conditioned media indicating that the hMSCs can respond to signals from keratinocytes. Accelerated wound closure was observed when hMSCs were injected near the site of excisional wounds in athymic as well as NOD/SCID mice. Interestingly, cell-free lysates prepared from hMSCs were also effective in inducing accelerated wound closure and increased expression of SDF 1 and CXCL- 5 at the wound bed. Additionally, concentrated media from hMSCs as well as an emulsion containing lysates prepared from hMSCs was also found to be more effective in rapid re-epithelialization than fibroblasts or vehicle-alone control. Use of cell-free derivatives may help replace expensive wound care approaches including use of growth factors, epidermal/dermal substitutes, synthetic membranes, cytokines, and matrix components, and most importantly avoid transmission of pathogens from human and animal products. CONCLUSION: These results encourage development of derivatives of hMSCs for wound care and re-epithelialization applications...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} coordination chemistry of imidazoles, metal-mediated imidazole activation is very rare. [1] It {{has been shown}} that deprotonation of the central C-H group of coordinated N-alkylimidazoles can serve, after reaction of the resulting imidazolyl intermediate with an electrophile, as a new synthetic route to N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. [2, 3] NHC ligands, which attract much ongoing interest, have been compared to tertiary phosphanes, although it {{has been shown that}} NHCs can participate in C-H or C-C activation of N-alkyl or N-aryl substituents,[4] and, occasionally, adopt abnormal binding modes. [5] We have found that the outcome of the deprotonation of coordinated N-alkylimidazoles dramatically depends on the nature of the imidazole substituent and the ancillary ligands, and in some examples C-C coupling products are obtained instead of NHC complexes. [3 a,b, 6] Even highly inert ligands, such as 2, 2 -bipyridine,[6] or additional N-alkylimidazoles,[3 a,b] afforded C-C coupling products, presumably reflecting a high nucleophilic character of the deprotonated species. Here we report the extension of our studies to [Re(CO) 3 (N-MeIm) 2 (PR 3) ]BAr’ 4 (N-MeIm = N-methylimidazole; Ar’ = 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) compounds, showing that the nature of the phosphane substituents crucially determines the type of product. For the triphenylphosphane <b>derivative,</b> <b>treatment</b> with excess of base followed by MeOTf leads to an unprecedented double activation of the N-alkylimidazole ligand. The product, a binuclear complex, features a bridging ligand that is both an abnormal NHC and a Fischer carbene. [Re(CO) 3 (N-MeIm) 2 (PR 3) ]BAr’ 4 (R = Me, 1; Ph 2) compounds were prepared in good yields by substitution of the triflate ligand by the tertiary phosphane, assisted by the salt NaBAr’ 4. Compounds 1 and 2 were spectroscopically characterized and the solid-state structure of 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction. [7, 8] The reaction of 1 with KN(SiMe 3) 2 in THF at- 78 °C afforded immediately the deprotonation of the central C-H group of an N-MeIm ligand, as shown by a large shift to lower wavenumbers i...|$|E
