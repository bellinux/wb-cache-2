5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and <b>flagellation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the <b>Flagellation</b> of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have been painted last {{as they are in}} a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from the Passion of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|The {{colourful}} Buhl altarpiece is {{the work}} of a group of followers of Martin Schongauer, who drew their inspiration both from his woodcuts and from his paintings, especially the Altarpiece of the Dominicans, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum. The Buhl painters closely followed their model's designs, but on a larger scale and in a simpler and technically cruder manner. While it is not documented that the altarpiece was commissioned by the convent of Saint Catherine, the closeness to the designs of Schongauer but also, to a lesser degree, of Caspar Isenmann (the panel depicting the <b>Flagellation</b> of Christ is reminding of the same scene in the altarpiece of St Martin's Church) indicate without a doubt that it has been painted in Colmar; furthermore, both Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula, who figure prominently in the Crucifixion scene, were particularly venerated by the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine.|$|E
50|$|Hangings {{never took}} place at Richmond Gaol but <b>flagellations</b> (whippings) did. You would be {{strapped}} to a wooden pyramid shaped thing and the lashes meted out accordingly. In some colonies it seems a kidney belt {{would be used to}} minimise harm to the kidneys but from the illustrations of <b>flagellations</b> taking place in the yard, this seemed to be absent.|$|R
60|$|Heavens and earth! whom should I {{perceive}} in {{the midst}} of them, but my early and tormenting flame, the everlasting Sacharissa! She was grown up, it is true, into the full beauty of womanhood, but showed by the provoking merriment of her countenance, that she perfectly recollected me, and the ridiculous <b>flagellations</b> of which she had twice been the cause.|$|R

50|$|Marawi City is {{predominantly}} Muslim city {{which accounts for}} 99.6% of the population. Sharia criminal law exists but without stoning, amputations, <b>flagellations</b> or other Islamic punishments as they are against {{the law of the}} Philippines. The distribution of alcoholic products and gambling is forbidden and women must cover their heads, though non-Muslims are exempted from this rule. Other than sharia law in personal matters, these laws are not applicable elsewhere in Lanao del Sur.|$|R
5000|$|The Convent School, or Early Experiences of A Young Flagellant is a 19th-century work of sado-masochistic pornography, written {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Rosa Coote {{and published by}} William Dugdale in London in 1876. Henry Spencer Ashbee catalogues it with the comment that [...] "the numerous <b>flagellations,</b> supplemented by filthy tortures, are insuperably tedious and revolting".

5000|$|The {{original}} Via Crucis {{initiated by}} the Marquis of Tarifa began inside the Casa de Pilatos in the Chapel of the <b>Flagellations</b> and ended at a pillar near the current Templete (small temple). Beginning in 1630, both {{the beginning and end}} of the route changed, beginning at the current shrine with its marble altarpiece erected that year on the façade of the Casa de Pilatos, and ending at the Templete. The simple wooden Cruz de las Toallas (literally [...] "Cross of the Towels") that previously marked the first station passed into the possession of the Hermandad de los Negritos (for whom see below).|$|R
60|$|Jack, however, magnanimously forgave his foe, and preached on, {{of course}} with fresh zeal; but not, alas! with much success. For the conjuror, though his main {{treasure}} was {{gone over to}} the camp of the enemy, had a reserve in a certain holy trumpet, which was hidden mysteriously in a cave on the neighboring hills, not to be looked on by woman under pain of death; and it was well known, and had been known for generations, that unless that trumpet, after fastings, <b>flagellations,</b> and other solemn rites, was blown by night throughout the woods, the palm-trees would bear no fruit; yea, so great was the fame of that trumpet, that neighboring tribes sent at the proper season to hire it and the blower thereof, by payment of much precious trumpery, that so they might be sharers in its fertilizing powers.|$|R
40|$|A rabbit {{antibody}} to mouse 3 T 3 cell fibronectin {{was used}} in conjunction with a fluorescein-tagged second antibody to detect fibronectin-like activity on the surface of rabbit spermatozoa. Only ejaculated sperm displayed an intense and highly localized fluorescence over the acrosomal region. Cauda epididymal sperm of the rabbit as well as several other species did not exhibit any reaction. The fluorescent activity could be eliminated by trypsin treatment but was re- established by incubation in cell-free seminal fluid. Sperm recovered from females 10 - 12 h after mating showed a reduction or absence of antifibronectin fluorescence, suggesting that this component's loss could be a factor in sperm capacitation. Because fibronectins show strong binding to collagen, mixtures of ejaculated sperm and collagen were examined in the light and electron microscope. Living sperm appear to have a strong affinity for collagen and quickly adhere to the filaments by their heads, while continuing vigorous <b>flagellations.</b> Surface labeling of sperm with the galactose-oxidase-NaB[3 H] 4 technique, extraction with urea-detergent mixtures and affinity chromatography of extracts on gelatin-Sepharose revealed a single radioactive band of mot wt approximately 40, 000 after SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography...|$|R
25|$|The nave has {{a series}} of Passion scenes along the south wall and Nativity scenes on the north. The scenes on the south wall are: the Entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, Christ washing the disciples' feet, the Betrayal of Christ, the <b>Flagellation</b> of Christ, Christ {{carrying}} his cross, the Crucifixion and the angel at the tomb.|$|E
25|$|The term {{discipline}} describes psychological restraining, {{with the}} use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior. Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public <b>flagellation)</b> or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the submissive partner to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Its {{impact on}} art was significant: it {{extended}} beyond numismatics and {{the proliferation of}} outstanding Renaissance medals to influence sculpture and painting. Renaissance artists subsequently used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type to represent exotic or antique figures. This {{can be seen in the}} work of Piero della Francesca who used the image of John in his <b>Flagellation</b> of Christ and Arezzo frescoes.|$|E
50|$|On 20 October 1520, Don Fadrique Enríquez de Rivera, First Marquis of Tarifa, {{returned}} from a trip through Europe and the Holy Land. During Lent in 1521, he inaugurated the observance in Seville of the Holy Via Crucis. The route began in the Chapel of the <b>Flagellations</b> of his palace and ended at a pillar located in what some sources say {{was known as the}} Huerta de los Ángeles (Orchard of the Angels), but more likely it was called Huerta de la Hermandad de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles, not far from the Cruz del Campo, the terminus of the route since 1630. This route ran the same distance of 997 m or 1321 paces supposed to have separated the praetorium of Pontius Pilate from Calvary. The Marquis's palace, the Palacio de San Andrés, was then still partly under construction; it later became known as the Casa de Pilatos through its association with the Via Crucis, and, much altered over the next few centuries, is now property of the dukes of Medinaceli. It was declared a National Monument in 1931. The oldest documentation of the name Casa de Pilatos is from 1754.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 October 1520, Don Fadrique {{returned}} from a trip through Europe and the Holy Land. During Lent in 1521, he inaugurated the observance in Seville of the Holy Via Crucis (Holy Way of the Cross). The route began in the Chapel of the <b>Flagellations</b> of his palace and ended at a pillar located {{not far from the}} Templete, or Cruz del Campo (The Cross of the Field,) located outside the city walls.

The Marquis's palace, the Palacio de San Andrés, was then still partly under construction; it later became known as the Casa de Pilatos through its association with the Vía Crucis, and was much altered over the next few centuries. Popular imagination has since mistakenly identified the palace as a copy of the house of Pilate; thus the rooms have been named along the theme of the Passion of Christ: [...] "Hall of the Praetorian", [...] "Chapel of the Flagellations", etc. It was declared a National Monument in 1931. The oldest documentation of the name Casa de Pilatos is from 1754.|$|R
40|$|The {{spermatozoon}} of the mealybug Pseudococcus obscures Essig is a filamentous cell (0. 25,i by 300 Ag) which exhibits three-dimensional <b>flagellations</b> {{throughout most}} of its length. It has microtubules (200 A diameter) and a threadlike nuclear core (0. 07 - 0. 09 pu diameter) which extend almost its entire length, but apparently it has no mitochondria, centrioles, typical flagellum, or acrosome. The microtubules are arranged in {{two and a half}} concentric rings and total 56 in the most actively motile region but form two or three concentric rings with totals of 28 or 56 tubules, respectively, in less active regions. The relation of unusual microtubular patterns to the 9 + 2 complex and to flagellar motion is discussed. Mealybug spermatozoa are transmitted to the female in motile bundles which are approximately 1. 3 Au by 750 tp and have four regions: (1) an anterior corkscrew region; (2) a region which contains approximately 16 spermatozoa; (3) a region of amorphous content; and (4) an endpiece. Bundle motility originates from the synchronous movements of its spermatozoa which appear to be arranged in two concentric multistranded helices. The spermatozoa provide both forward and gyratory motions of the bundle, and the corkscrew complements bundle propulsion by converting part of the rotation into forward movement...|$|R
25|$|During {{the ninth}} century BC, ritual flagellations were {{performed}} in Artemis Orthia, {{one of the}} most important religious areas of ancient Sparta, where the Cult of Orthia, a preolympic religion, was practiced. Here ritual <b>flagellation</b> called diamastigosis took place, in which young adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess. These are referred to by a number of ancient authors, including Pausanius (III, 16: 10-11).|$|E
25|$|Piero della Francesca {{carried his}} study of light further. In the <b>Flagellation</b> he {{demonstrates}} a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the concept}} of the modern prison largely {{remained}} unknown until the early 19th-century. Punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment, including capital punishment, mutilation, <b>flagellation</b> (whipping), branding, and non-physical punishments, such as public shaming rituals (like the stocks). From the Middle Ages up to the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, imprisonment was rarely used as a punishment in its own right, and prisons were mainly to hold those awaiting trial and convicts awaiting punishment.|$|E
60|$|For a {{month or}} more {{thereafter}} {{he was a member of}} the princely household, and, after a little while, a trusted and honored member. Perhaps it was the calm sturdy strength, the courage of the young knight, that first appealed to the Prince's royal heart; perhaps afterwards it was the more sterling qualities that underlaid that courage that drew him to the young man; certain it was that in two weeks Myles was the acknowledged favorite. He made no protestation of virtue; he always accompanied the Prince in those madcap ventures to London, where he beheld all manner of wild revelry; he never held himself aloof from his gay comrades, but he looked upon all their mad sports with the same calm gaze that had carried him without taint through the courts of Burgundy and the Dauphin. The gay, roistering young lords and gentlemen dubbed him Saint Myles, and jested with him about hair-cloth shirts and <b>flagellations,</b> but witticism and jest alike failed to move Myles's patient virtue; he went his own gait in the habits of his life, and in so going knew as little as the others of the mad court that the Prince's growing liking for him was, perhaps, more than all else, on account of that very temperance.|$|R
6000|$|The outrages and violences now {{committed}} are of that astonishing {{nature as}} were never known or heard of during {{the administration of}} the Circar. Hyder Naik, the cruellest of tyrants, used every kind of oppression in the Circar countries; but even his measures were not like those now pursued. Such of the inhabitants as had escaped the sword and pillage of Hyder Naik, by taking refuge in the woods, and within the walls of Vellore, &c., on the arrival of Lord Macartney's aumildar to Vellore, and in consequence of his cowle of protection and support, most cheerfully returned to the villages, set about the cultivation of the lands, and with great pains rebuilt their cottages.--But now the aumildar has imprisoned the wives and children of the inhabitants, seized the few jewels that were on the bodies of the women, and then, before the faces of their husbands, flogged them, in order to make them produce other jewels and effects, which he said they had buried somewhere under ground, and to make the inhabitants bring him money, notwithstanding there was yet no cultivation in the country. Terrified with the <b>flagellations,</b> some of them produced their jewels and wearing-apparel of their women, to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas, which they had hidden; others, who declared they had none, the aumildar flogged their women severely, tied cords around their breasts, and tore the sucking children from their teats, and exposed them to the scorching heat of the sun. Those children died, as did the wife of Ramsoamy, an inhabitant of Bringpoor. Even this could not stir up compassion in the breast of the aumildar. Some of the children that were somewhat large he exposed to sale. In short, the violences of the aumildar are so astonishing, that the people, on seeing the present situation, remember the loss of Hyder with regret. With whomsoever the aumildar finds a single measure of natchinee or rice, he takes it away from him, and appropriates it to the expenses of the sibindy that he keeps up. No revenues are collected from the countries, but from the effects of the poor, wretched inhabitants. Those ryots [yeomen] who intended to return to their habitations, hearing of those violences, have fled for refuge, with their wives and children, into Hyder's country. Every day is ushered in and closed with these violences and disturbances. I have no power to do anything; and who will hear what I have to say? My business is to inform your Highness, who are my master. The people bring their complaints to me, and I tell them I will write to your Highness.[74] ...|$|R
25|$|The Talmud prohibits any {{activity}} which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together). The main {{concern in the}} Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry {{a member of the}} priesthood. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin or made them a harlot. Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to <b>flagellation</b> rather than the death penalty.|$|E
