40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the design of}} large-scale networks is to predict and optimise the total time and energy consumption required to deliver a packet from a source node to a destination node. Examples of such complex networks include wireless ad hoc and sensor networks which need to deal with the effects of node mobility, routing inaccuracies, higher packet loss rates, limited or time-varying effective bandwidth, energy constraints, and the computational limitations of the nodes. They also include more reliable communication environments, such as wired networks, that are susceptible to random failures, security threats and malicious behaviours which compromise their quality of service (QoS) guarantees. In such networks, packets traverse a number of hops that cannot be determined in advance and encounter non-homogeneous network conditions that have been largely ignored in the literature. This thesis examines analytical properties of packet travel in large networks and investigates the implications of some packet coding techniques on both QoS and resource utilisation. Specifically, we use a mixed jump and diffusion model to represent packet traversal through large networks. The model accounts for network non-homogeneity regarding routing and the loss rate that a packet experiences as it passes successive segments of a source to destination route. A mixed analytical-numerical method is developed to compute the average packet travel time and the energy it consumes. The model is able to capture the effects of increased loss rate in areas remote from the source and <b>destination,</b> <b>variable</b> rate of advancement towards destination over the route, as well as of defending against malicious packets within a certain distance from the destination. We then consider sending multiple coded packets that follow independent paths to the destination node so as to mitigate the effects of losses and routing inaccuracies. We study a homogeneous medium and obtain the time-dependent properties of the packet’s travel process, allowing us to compare the merits and limitations of coding, both in terms of delivery times and energy efficiency. Finally, we propose models that can assist in the analysis and optimisation of the performance of inter-flow network coding (NC). We analyse two queueing models for a router that carries out NC, in addition to its standard packet routing function. The approach is extended to the study of multiple hops, which leads to an optimisation problem that characterises the optimal time that packets should be held back in a router, waiting for coding opportunities to arise, so that the total packet end-to-end delay is minimised.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to capture the causal {{relationships}} between the primary constituents of the tourism destination paradigm – namely, the economy, society, and the natural and infrastructural environments – and demand for tourism at that destination. Design/methodology/approach – Inspired by prior tourism literature, the study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) methodologies with a cross‐sectional data sample from 162 countries, to evaluate a priori proposed measurement and structural models for relationships among the economy, society, environment constructs, and tourism. Findings – The results indicate that although the economy construct was found to have no direct influence on tourism, it does have a mediating, positive impact on tourism through the society and environment constructs, with the society construct paralleling the condition of the infrastructure. Moreover, society and environment were found to have a direct, positive impact on generating tourism activities, and revenues. Research limitations/implications – This study contributes to the literature on tourism demand modeling by verifying causal relationships between tourism constructs and supply variables at the “country” level. In other words, it examines whether relationships among tourism constructs and variables exist and, as such, asks if they are responsible for a destination's success. Practical implications – This study's results provide destination managers with information to help them understand how individual variables affect the economy, society, and tourism industry aggregately, and as such what actions or investments can help to develop a country's tourism industry effectively. Originality/value – By integrating several supply‐side factors related to the destination, this paper provides more comprehensive results compared to previous applications of SEM that used a limited number of <b>destination</b> <b>variables</b> and subsequently provided only limited results.

We divided the patients into two groups, according to age. Patients in group A were 74  years old or younger {{at the time of}} admission to our ICU, and those in group B were 75  years old or older. Data regarding age, gender, height, weight, indication for ICU admission (surgical or non-surgical), APACHE II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores on the day of ICU admission, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, cerebral stroke, and cancer), duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, residence before hospitalization and discharge destination (home or other), physical status before ICU admission and at hospital discharge (walking, sitting, bed rest), and in-hospital mortality were collected from the medical records. We defined good physical status as walking and poor physical status as sitting and bed rest. The major outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients who were discharged home and good physical status at hospital discharge.

After specifying the functional forms of these relationships, the analyst can estimate model parameters using observed flow data and standard estimation techniques such as ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. Competing destinations versions of spatial interaction models include the proximity among the destinations (or origins) in addition to the origin-destination proximity; this captures the effects of destination (origin) clustering on flows.

Furthermore, the increased model strength and parameter estimates associated with immigrant concentration and a concentration-weighted accessibility measure suggest that the spatial structure of destination choice {{has much to do with}} immigrant concentration at multiple scales – from metro areas to immigrant states and regions. The paper thus suggests more attention to theorising the geographical contexts within which intergenerational immigrant incorporation occurs...|$|R
40|$|Following Baloglu and Brinberg (1997), who {{advocate}} that the affective image space {{may be used}} as a tool to positioning tourism destinations, the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce latent class factor analysis (LCFA) to map the affective space of environments, namely tourism destinations. Twelve European cities, marketed as short-break destinations for Portuguese travelers, were appraised by a sample of 140 respondents on 20 indicators of affective qualities, taken from Russell and Pratt (1980). The affective qualities attributed to the destinations were successfully reproduced by LCFA on two bipolar latent dimensions, positive or negative valence and high or low arousal. Each of the 20 indicators relates as expected with the poles of the latent dimensions. Considering the <b>variable</b> <b>destination</b> as a covariate, its categories (i. e. the destinations) are depicted in the affective map and tend to cluster in the four quadrants, allowing to easily identifying each destination‘s positioning...|$|R
