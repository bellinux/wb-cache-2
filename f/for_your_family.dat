For your faith to be more important than your job, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>family</b> to be more important than that job....

'And you, ye doil'd dotard,' replied his gentle helpmate, her wrath, {{which had}} {{hitherto}} wandered abroad {{over the whole}} assembly, being at once and violently impelled into its natural channel, 'YE stand there hammering dog-heads for fules that will never snap them at a Highlandman, instead of earning bread <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>family</b> and shoeing this winsome young gentleman's horse that's just come frae the north!

We have some broken ends of your adventures in the provinces, which you will do very well not to drive me to investigate.

6000|$|Slinn looked {{quickly and}} sharply into Don Caesar's grave face. He {{seemed to be}} {{incapable}} of any double meaning. However, as he had no serious reason for awakening Don Caesar's jealousy, and very little desire to become an embarrassing third in this conversation, and possibly a burden to the young lady, he proceeded to take his leave of her. From a sudden feminine revulsion of sympathy, or from some unintelligible instinct of diplomacy, Mamie said, as she extended her hand, [...] "I hope you'll find a home <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>family</b> near here.

6000|$|... "Make {{no mention}} of such a trifle. I would ask you to accept it as a token of my regard <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>family,</b> only that would be to affront so wealthy a man.
