25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} is not {{a suitable}} method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial <b>inkjet</b> <b>printing.</b> However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods. The metal cathode may {{still need to be}} deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir-Blodgett film.|$|E
25|$|The {{applications}} for sol gel-derived products are numerous. For example, scientists {{have used it}} to produce the world’s lightest materials and also some of its toughest ceramics. One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced {{on a piece of}} substrate by spin coating or dip coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, electrophoresis, <b>inkjet</b> <b>printing</b> or roll coating.|$|E
25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, typefaces {{intended}} to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be filled up with ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the type design. Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through <b>inkjet</b> <b>printing,</b> laser printing, offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs {{intended to be}} printed on low-quality, absorbent paper, especially newsprint and telephone directories.|$|E

40|$|Jennifer Jae GutierrezInkjet {{prints are}} a new medium {{in the field of}} art {{conservation}} in relation to other art forms. In order to establish why <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> should be cared for, familiarity with the history and current uses of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> is necessary. An understanding of the materials which create <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> is essential in determining protocol for their care and treatment. <b>Inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> may be damaged by a variety of sources, and the longevity of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> may vary based upon which combination of materials has been chosen. Establishing protocol for surface cleaning <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> is a need within the field of art conservation, and was determined to be the goal of this project. The materials tested are widely used to create fine-art <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints.</b> The Epson Stylus Pro 4800 printer was chosen for this reason, and because it employs the K 3 Ultrachrome ink set, which is pigment based. Two different microporous inkjet papers, Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster and Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk, were tested. A digital file, or ???target,??? was designed using well-known color space values, and used to create twelve sample prints. Preliminary quantitative measurements of changes in color were made, as well as qualitative analysis of surface sheen and dye migration. This analysis was repeated after testing. The cleaning solutions tested were deionized water, a water and ethanol solution, and a PhotoFlo and water solution. These materials were chosen because they are common cleaning agents which are likely {{to be found in the}} labs of most photograph conservators. Two cleaning techniques were tested; application with a cotton swab and full immersion. Results suggest that two of the cleaning materials used may be acceptable for future treatment of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints.</b> Ethanol and water was determined to be inappropriate for cleaning the inkjet materials tested in this study, and immersion was determined to be inappropriate for prints created on Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk. Cleaning with cotton swabs produced noticeable changes in surface sheen in paper white areas, but this technique may be acceptable for image areas. Further research of alternative cleaning methods and materials is suggested to yield conclusive results. Alumni Relations at the University of Delaware and Undergraduate Research Program.

40|$|The {{stability}} of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> and photographs {{is influenced by}} the factors of the surrounding environment. The most harmful factors of environment are the light and the pollutants like ozone. Durability of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> is besides the ink composition, affected by the type of receiving layer. In this paper will be discussed the lightfastness of <b>inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> and photographs during the long-term ageing tests. <b>Inkjet</b> <b>prints</b> were prepared using both dye-based and pigment-based inks.

Gamut volume of samples was evaluated by program VolGa, which is a Matlab based utility useful for the monitoring and evaluation of lightfastness of print.

40|$|Fully <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> {{fabrication}} of thin film transistors (TFTs) is desirable to enable reproducible, high throughput, low cost production of electronics under mild conditions. However, TFT devices fabricated from printable materials typically exhibit inferior performance {{to those of}} non-printed. For example, {{there is a lack}} of well performing source-drain electrode materials for metal oxide semiconductors. In contrast to vacuum-deposited Al, printed Ag has a high contact resistance and work function, with poor charge carrier injection to the semiconductor. Therefore, there is a requirement to improve electrical performance of TFTs incorporating printed electrode material such as Ag. The approach to achieve this through this work is by inclusion of an <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> thin film of polyethyleneimine (PEI) at the interface between semiconductor and source-drain contacts. PEI contains tertiary amine groups, which possess lone pairs of electrons available to assist charge injection and lower the interfacial resistance. Two sets of reference devices were prepared, both with <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> In 2 O 3 semiconductor. One set was fabricated by vacuum deposition of Al for source drain electrodes, the other set with <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> Ag source drain contact electrodes. The solution-based processing method limits the thermal budget to 300 °C. Devices with Al electrodes provided charge carrier saturation mobility (μsat) of 4. 3 ± 0. 93 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, whereas those with Ag contacts exhibited an expected lower μsat of 8. 0 · 10 - 3 ± 3. 9 · 10 - 3 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. Addition of an <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> interfacial thin film containing PEI between the semiconductor and Ag contact electrodes significantly increased the μsat to 3. 1 ± 0. 53 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. Interfacial engineering in this work yielded TFTs possessing printed Ag contacts that display electrical performance comparable with devices incorporating vacuum-deposited Al contacts. The impact of this result is the possibility for high performance fully printed TFTs. Development of this fabrication route might facilitate low temperature solution based roll-to-roll production of electrical components containing fully <b>inkjet</b> <b>printed</b> TFT devices...|$|R
