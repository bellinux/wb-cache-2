25|$|Martha taunts George aggressively, and he retaliates {{with his}} usual passive aggression. Martha tells an {{embarrassing}} story about how she humiliated him with a sucker-punch {{in front of her}} father. During the telling, George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella pops out. After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, {{at the end of the}} act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, because she <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad {{more than a year}} to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E
25|$|Completed in 1875, Old Main, a two-towered brick {{building}} {{designed in the}} Second Empire style, was the primary instructional and administrative building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its design {{was based on the}} plans for the main academic building at the University of Illinois, which has since been demolished. However, the clock and bell towers were switched at Arkansas. The northern taller tower is the bell tower, and the southern shorter tower is the clock tower. One legend for the tower switch is that the taller tower was put to the north as a reminder of the Union victory during the Civil War. A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until October 2005. The bell tower has always had some type of chime, initially a bell that was rung on the hour by student volunteers. Electronic chimes were installed in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My {{heart goes out to}} him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|May later blamed {{her actions}} on fatigue and insisted she hadn't <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> [...] "I didn't {{have a lot}} of wine," [...] May said, [...] "but it may have hit me harder than I thought it would". When {{questioned}} if she should resign, May responded that [...] "a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell." [...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized," [...] Peck said. [...] "One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern." [...] It's more of an [...] "inside Ottawa beltway" [...] thing anyway, Peck added.|$|E

6000|$|... "You started your hay-making {{ten days}} too late," [...] Segerson {{interrupted}} sternly. [...] "You {{had plenty of}} warning.

60|$|MRS. JONES. I {{asked him}} {{whatever}} came over {{him to do}} such a thing --and he said it was the drink. He said he had <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> and something came over him. And of course, your Worship, he had had very little to eat all day, and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat. Your Worship may not know, but it is the truth. And I {{would like to say that}} all through his married life, I have never known him to {{do such a thing}} before, though we have passed through great hardships and [speaking with soft emphasis] I am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time.|$|E
