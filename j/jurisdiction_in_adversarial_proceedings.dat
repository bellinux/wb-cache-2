40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{a topic that}} is not new, but it remains current:  the participatory construction of the criminal decision in a democratic State ruled by law. Starting from the concepts of Rule of Law, of Guarantism and of Democracy, it seeks to renew {{the importance of the}} equal and dialectical participation of the parties, through the adversarial system, for the composition of a fair and legitimate criminal judicial decision. It is argued, from this perspective, that the parties should take the role of protagonists in the procedural scenario, since the decision should be built in a participatory way, i. e., based on the arguments and evidence presented, thus reducing the gaps that favor judicial discretion and decisionism. It is proposed, therefore, that the solution to the concrete case (acceptance or dismissal of the information or indictment, grant or rejection of a criminal precautionary measure, conviction or acquittal) should be elaborated with support on the contribution of the litigants, from the contrast of their arguments and of the evidence produced, <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> <b>in</b> the regular course of the process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a number of Internet-based multi-sided {{platforms}} have emerged that provide free services to, in some cases, millions of businesses. More such platforms are being spawned as the Internet-based economy grows. This Article argues that under current norms <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> such as those involving competition policy, these platforms are likely to face large numbers of complaints <b>in</b> multiple <b>jurisdictions,</b> a substantial likelihood {{that at least one}} of these complaints will result in a false-positive decision against the platform, and material risk of a false-positive decision that results in catastrophic consequences. These effects result from a combination of business users of free services receiving a free litigation option they can pursue if they have any complaints; an adverse-selection problem that results from free services being particularly attractive to start-ups that do not have or want to invest capital in their businesses; and the sheer number of free-business users resulting in a high cumulative probability of at least one false-positive decision. After documenting these phenomena, this Article argues that government policymakers, including competition authorities and courts, should adopt a heightened level of scrutiny concerning complaints from free business users. This heightened level of scrutiny is necessary to counteract the impact of excessive litigation on innovation by multi-sided platforms...|$|R

40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have expressed concern}} over the plight {{of children in the}} nation’s court system, fearing that child victim/witnesses might suffer significant trauma. In efforts to alleviate this presumed trauma, new laws were passed and traditional procedures were modified. This paper synthesizes available research addressing 2 questions pertaining to the mental health needs of child victims: (1) To what extent are children traumatized by their involvement in the justice system, and (2) What interventions are effective in reducing children’s trauma? The review concludes that most children can testify without suffering long-term adverse effects. It also identifies elements of the justice system that appear to heighten stress for children. Finally, it suggests several strategies that might be effective in alleviating that stress. KEY WORDS: child victims; sexual abuse; child testimony; court reform. The last few {{decades of the twentieth century}} witnessed great concern over the plight of children in the nation’s court system. Children were thought to be ill-equipped—developmentally, cognitively, and emoti-onally—to withstand the stressors of testifying <b>in</b> public <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> especially when those proceed-ings centered on alleged abusive events in which children were the focal participants. Consequently, many feared that children might suffer significant trauma when subjected to the criminal justice system. In efforts to alleviate this presumed trauma, new laws were passed and traditional procedures were modified. Concurrently, a sizeable body of research emerged that helped to clarify our understanding of court-related stressors and the rela-tive benefits of various interventions. This paper traces the recent history of efforts to create a more “child-friendly” environment in the court system, along with research find-ings that elucidate and enhance our knowledge about the effects of legal interventions on children’s mental health...|$|R
40|$|Persistence of Procedural Relationship of Parties in Civil Proceedings The thesis {{deals with}} the {{procedural}} relationship <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> civil <b>proceedings.</b> The aim of the thesis is to define the persistence of procedural relationship as a characteristic of civil proceedings, {{as one of the}} fundamental principles of civil proceedings, and to analyze exceptions to this principle. The thesis is divided into two sections. The first one focuses on changes of parties in procedural relationship, while the latter one focuses on changes in procedural relationship attributable related to the court. The thesis aims to comprehensively address the procedural relationship of parties, thus it includes a section referring to changes of procedural relationship related to the court. The thesis primarily focuses on changes of procedural relationship relating to the parties, such as joinder of parties and substitution of parties. Since the general rule refers to the persistence of procedural relationship, derived from the rights of parties to a judgement on the merits, it is necessary to save the procedural rights of parties should any exception to this general rule apply.

I am also concerned. But the best response is not to abolish or severely restrict judicial settlement conferences. Rather, it is to add more formality and more written guidelines. New guidelines would discourage each trial court judge from marching {{to the beat of}} her own drummer. These guidelines should involve, as suggested by Professor Fuller, both more adversary control and more detailed and written criteria. In addition, new guidelines should expressly recognize that the claims and interests that might be discussed at judicial settlement conferences are far broader than the justiciable claims that might be discussed at trial preparation conferences. Thus, civil case settlement talks and civil case settlements subject to same-case judicial enforcement can involve many more claims, interests, and people than would have been involved <b>in</b> any <b>adversarial</b> <b>proceedings.</b> New written guidelines for federal and state courts should follow existing rules and statutes of general and particular applicability already operating in some American trial courts.

40|$|Introduction Concern {{for crime}} victims {{has been a}} growing {{political}} issue in improving the legitimacy and success {{of the criminal justice}} system through the rhetoric of rights. Since the 1970 s there have been numerous reforms and policy documents produced to enhance victims’ satisfaction in the criminal justice system. Both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have seen a sea-change in more recent years from a focus on services for victims to a greater emphasis on procedural rights. The purpose of this chapter is to chart these reforms against the backdrop of wider political and regional changes emanating from the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights, and to critically examine whether the position of crime victims has actually ameliorated. While separated into two legal jurisdictions, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland as common law countries have both grappled with similar challenges in improving crime victim satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> This chapter begins by discussing the historical and theoretical concern for crime victims in the criminal justice system, and how this has changed in recent years. The rest of the chapter is split into two parts focusing on the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Both parts examine the provisions of services to victims, and the move towards more procedural rights for victims in terms of information, participation, protection and compensation. The chapter concludes by finding that despite being different legal jurisdictions, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have introduced many similar reforms for crime victims in recent years...|$|R

40|$|The WTO 2 ̆ 7 s Dispute Settlement Understanding (2 ̆ 2 DSU 2 ̆ 2) {{provides}} that disputes {{are to be}} resolved <b>in</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>proceedings</b> before impartial panels of experts. These panels have authority to decide whether members 2 ̆ 7 laws conform to WTO requirements; members may appeal rulings to a permanent Appellate Body within the organization, which has the final say on questions of law and legal interpretation. Under the DSU, if a member fails {{to comply with a}} final ruling in a dispute, the prevailing party may retaliate by suspending trade concessions that it owes the offending member. This retaliation can continue until the offending member implements the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Judging by the frequency with which members resort to it, the new mechanism is a stunning success. Still, WTO dispute settlement has drawn great criticism, much of it focusing on the new enforcement mechanism. Several commentators argue that the retaliation remedy is too weak and unpredictable to be of any real use. By contrast, other critics contend that the present enforcement regime is too coercive and inflexible. To them, retaliation seems high handed, an attempt to force sovereign states to repeal laws that were enacted by democratically elected governments. Suspending trade concessions, they point out, hurts innocent firms that find their products subject to higher tariffs. Moreover, the retaliation remedy undercuts the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s own first principles by creating a situation where two countries—the offending member that has enacted the protectionist measure and the injured member that has responded with trade sanctions—have departed from free trade commitments. These critics argue that the WTO should consider 2 ̆ 2 softer 2 ̆ 2 enforcement mechanisms with fewer 2 ̆ 2 teeth. ” In this essay, I defend the existing enforcement mechanism. I do so by explaining the mechanism in terms of interest group theory. Even though protectionist measures injure consumers as a whole, countries often adopt such measures to satisfy the demands of domestic interest groups that suffer because of free trade. By imposing burdens on the products of countries that adopt such measures, the retaliation remedy creates incentives for another set of domestic interest groups—exporters—to lobby against them. Over time, if retaliation is correctly calibrated, the domestic groups that favor free trade can neutralize the effect of the domestic groups that oppose it. The retaliation remedy thus promotes compliance with WTO rulings without intruding directly on domestic institutions. In this way, the mechanism is superior to suggested reforms, like direct effect, that would commandeer courts or other national governmental bodies. Indeed, the genius of the retaliation remedy lies in its ability to use the domestic political process to achieve the public interest. By setting one collection of interest groups against another, the retaliation remedy encourages the adoption of free trade policies that benefit a nation 2 ̆ 7 s consumers as a whole. This essay proceeds as follows. First, I explain the interest group theory of trade restrictions, showing how interest groups can secure the adoption of protectionist measures that work to the detriment of consumers as a whole. I then describe the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement mechanism and demonstrate how it can overcome the problems posed by protectionist groups and promote compliance with a nation 2 ̆ 7 s free trade commitments. Next, I discuss the two disputes to date in which prevailing parties have resorted to the retaliation remedy, Bananas and Hormones. Finally, I show how the retaliation remedy is superior to one suggested reform that has drawn a great deal of attention, namely, giving WTO rulings direct effect in national courts...|$|R
