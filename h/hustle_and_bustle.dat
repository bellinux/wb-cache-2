5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

The Ministry also has over 700 fireplaces in its headquarters so that officials and workers can go directly to/from work without the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of travelling on brooms or by Portkey - or the indignity of having to flush themselves in through a public toilet, as portrayed in Deathly Hallows.|$|E

Como also hosts a prestigious clay-court tennis tournament every year, the Città di Como Challenger, which attracts many of the world's top players who {{are not involved in}} the concurrent US Open (tennis). Many players have testified that they much prefer playing in the relaxed and friendly Como environs than the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. Previous champions include Pablo Carreño Busta, Viktor Troicki and the 2016 champion Kenny de Schepper who once again will be eschewing the US Open to defend his crown.|$|E
25|$|At {{the centre}} of all Nambassa festivals lay the village marketplaces. These {{consisted}} of dozens of hand craft outlets and health food eateries. Here the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle,</b> the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as civilization itself.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} Upper Hutt was a rural service town {{supporting}} the surrounding rural farming and forestry community. Serious urbanisation {{of the upper}} Hutt Valley only started around the 1920s but from the late 1940s onwards Upper Hutt's population exploded as people moved from the crowded <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of inner city Wellington into a more secluded yet sprawling Hutt Valley. In 1950 Trentham Memorial Park was created with an area of almost 50 hectares. In July 1955, the electrification of the railway line from Wellington to Upper Hutt was completed, allowing fast electric multiple unit trains to replace steam- and diesel-electric-hauled carriage trains. Later in November, the 8.8km Rimutaka Tunnel opened, bypassing the Rimutaka Incline {{and most of the}} existing line between Upper Hutt and Featherston, and reducing the time between the two from 2.5 hours to just 40 minutes.|$|E

I {{must take}} a line in which to tell, after I was <b>hustled</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustled,</b> kicked <b>and</b> punched, up that terrible {{stairway}} by Thurston {{and the rest of}} the prison-dogs, of the infinite relief of my narrow cell when I found myself back in solitary. It was all so safe, so secure. I felt like a lost child returned home again. I loved those very walls that I had so hated for five years. All that kept the vastness of space, like a monster, from pouncing upon me were those good stout walls of mine, close to hand on every side. Agoraphobia is a terrible affliction. I have had little opportunity to experience it, but from that little I can only conclude that hanging is a far easier matter. [...] .|$|R
5000|$|Located between Geylang Road and Grove Road (now Mountbatten Road), Gay World {{was one of}} {{the famous}} trio of [...] "World" [...] {{amusement}} parks in Singapore. Together with the other two [...] "Worlds", Great World Amusement Park (1930s-1978) at Kim Seng Road and New World Amusement Park (1923-1987) at Jalan Besar, Gay World Park was <b>hustling</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustling</b> with nightlife during the 1930s to 1960s. These amusement parks were especially popular among Singaporeans as it was the locals only form of entertainment, before television or shopping malls were introduced. Gay World Park was an all-in-one complex, where visitors were offered a wide range of entertainment, from movies to shopping and games. However, as its popularity began to dip in the 1970s, Gay World Park was eventually demolished in 2000 to make way for residential estates. This officially marked the end of Gay World Park and its journey in the entertainment industry.|$|R

500|$|The network {{consists}} of two lines: the original LRT Line1 (LRT-1) or Green Line, and the more modern LRT Line2 (LRT-2), or Blue Line. [...] The LRT-1 is aligned in a general north–south direction along over 17.2kilometers (10.7mi) of fully elevated track. [...] From Monumento it runs south above the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of Rizal and Taft Avenues along grade-separated concrete viaducts allowing exclusive right-of-way before ending in Baclaran. [...] A four-station east–west extension along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue that will connect Monumento to the North Avenue station was opened in 2010, although the common station is not yet constructed. [...] Including the extension's two recently opened stations, Balintawak and Roosevelt, the LRT-1 has twenty stations. [...] The LRT-2 or Line 2 {{consists of}} eleven stations in a general east–west direction over 13.8 kilometers (8.57mi) of mostly elevated track, with one station lying underground. [...] Commencing in Recto, the line follows a corridor defined by Claro M. Recto and Legarda Avenues, Ramon Magsaysay and Aurora Boulevards, and the Marikina-Infanta Highway before reaching {{the other end of}} the line at Santolan. [...] The system passes through the cities of Caloocan, Manila, Marikina, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, and San Juan.|$|E
60|$|Nora Reilly {{comes down}} the hill. A slight weak woman in a pretty muslin print gown [her best], she is a figure commonplace enough to Irish eyes; but on the {{inhabitants}} of fatter-fed, crowded, <b>hustling</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustling</b> modern countries she makes a very different impression. The absence of any symptoms of coarseness or hardness or appetite in her, her comparative delicacy of manner and sensibility of apprehension, her thin hands and slender figure, her travel accent, with the caressing plaintive Irish melody of her speech, give her a charm which {{is all the more}} effective because, being untravelled, she is unconscious of it, and never dreams of deliberately dramatizing and exploiting it, as the Irishwoman in England does. For Tom Broadbent therefore, an attractive woman, whom he would even call ethereal. To Larry Doyle, an everyday woman fit only for the eighteenth century, helpless, useless, almost sexless, an invalid without the excuse of disease, an incarnation of everything in Ireland that drove him out of it. These judgments have little value and no finality; but they are the judgments on which her fate hangs just at present. Keegan touches his hat to her: he does not take it off.|$|R

50|$|The equine {{industry}} {{is an ongoing}} <b>hustling</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustling</b> market. This {{industry is}} best known for its pricey thoroughbred filly’s and stallions and the races that we see on television, such as the well-known Kentucky Derby. About 4.6 million Americans are involved in someway, shape or form with horses. There are many different ways in being a part of the equine community. Wranglers, ranchers, parents and more are all part of this community. As a wrangler, you can be wrangling wild horses out in the western portion of the United States. As a parent, you could be investing equally as much time as your child for something that they adore, such as equine. Many people use horses in a variety of shows and races in order to win awards, including jumping, endurance races, and horsemanship and western pleasure. Horses can also be used in an occupation, such as ranching or wrangling (The Equine Network, 2017). Approximately 6.9 million horses are own by citizens throughout the United States of America in total. There is a four to one ratio with the number of horses that are in the country to people who own horses that are in the United States of America (The Equestrian Channel). In a recent survey performed by The American Horse Council, an estimated four million horses are used in recreational use, three million for showing, one hundred thousand for racing and two million for other forms of utilization. Ultimately, horses are primarily used leisurely and recreationally now (The American Horse Council, 2005). Horses have become not exactly a necessity to many people, but rather a favorite past time, and a hobby that can be life-long. However, there are, of course, people who use horses as livestock and a major mode of transportation, which makes this luxury to some, and a necessity to others.|$|R

2500|$|In 1897, Shinn {{was offered}} a higher paying job as an {{illustrator}} for Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. (Theodore Dreiser also worked for the World at that time.) He was joined shortly after by his wife, Flossie, and by {{other members of the}} Charcoal Club. Shinn enjoyed living in the city and observing the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of Manhattan. [...] His fascination with the intensity of urban life is evident in paintings like Fire on Mott Street and Fight or in his renderings of election rallies and matinee crowds. Shinn had a particular interest in scenes of drama (accidents, buildings on fire) and street violence. Interestingly, his preferred medium at this time when not drawing for the newspaper was pastel, the medium least associated with the grittiness of his subject matter.

2500|$|A {{beautiful}} {{example of}} this mix of principles {{is seen in the}} Park's Mall in New York's Central Park, a large promenade leading to the Bethesda Terrace and the single formal feature in Olmsted and Vaux's original naturalistic design. The designers wrote that a [...] "'grand promenade' was an 'essential feature of a metropolitan park'"; however, its formal symmetry, its style, though something of an aberration, was designed so as to be subordinate to the natural view surrounding it. Wealthy passengers were let from their carriages at its south end. The carriage would then drive around to the Terrace, which overlooked the Lake and Ramble to pick them up, saving them the trouble of needing to double back on foot. The Promenade was lined with slender elms and offered views of Sheep Meadow. Affluent New Yorkers, who rarely walked through the park, mixed with the less well-to-do, and all enjoyed an escape from the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of the surrounding city.|$|E

Philippide, in common with other Junimists, deplored the French influence on Romania, believing the country needed a Germanic touch for its betterment. He was proud to live far from the <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of Bucharest, hoping to revive the Junimea-era glories of the country's former cultural capital that he inhabited. To this end, he helped bring a superior class of students, professors, writers and artists to Iași.|$|E

She leaves her partner Sally cleaning their apartment and heads outside into a June morning. Walking to the flower shop, Clarissa enjoys the everyday <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of the city. The sights and sounds she encounters serve as jumping-off points for her thoughts about life, her loves and her past.

In fact, the flowers are for a party Clarissa is hosting at her apartment that night for Richard (now a renowned poet dying of AIDS) as he has just won the Carrouthers, an esteemed poetry prize awarded for a life's work.
