40|$|The voltage {{transients}} generated {{during the}} breaker operations in cable systems, for instance, a wind park collection grid, can reach very low rise times. The rise times of these transients can be almost 50 times {{shorter than the}} rise time of a lightning pulse. Such transients can generate a very high voltage stress on the internal transformers insulation. In this paper, a test case is studied using verified models {{of different types of}} transformers and wind turbine layouts in order to account for typical wind turbine layouts found in modern wind farms. A critical switching scenario is chosen in order to provoke the highest possible voltage transients during a current interruption. Furthermore, internal overvoltages are estimated using model of a similarly sized winding. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage transients is higher than the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Moreover, it is found that the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter than the rise time of the lightning pulse. The shortest rise time of 40 ns is obtained in a wind turbine layout where the wind turbine breaker is placed near the transformer. Due to very short rise times of the transients, very high internal overvoltages are estimated in <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformer</b> windings. These internal overvoltages are much higher than overvoltages recorded at the basic lightning impulse level. For a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed {{in the bottom of a}} tower and a <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformer</b> in a nacelle, the highest turn-to-turn voltage of about 1. 5 pu is estimated.

The modeled hot resistance will help to find the load losses at any load situation without using complicated measurement set up in transformers. Results: These techniques were applied for the hot resistance estimation for dry type transformer by using the input variables cold resistance, ambient temperature and temperature rise.

40|$|The {{electric}} transients generated {{during the}} switching of a breaker placed near the transformer {{in a system}} with {{a substantial amount of}} cables can have a very short rise time and can reach very high magnitudes. In practice, the magnitude of the voltage surges is usually limited using the surge arresters while the rise time of the surge to which the apparatus is exposed, remains unchanged. In this paper, the characteristic of the switching transients generated in the MV cable grids are analyzed. For this purpose, cases with both dry-type and oil insulated transformers are studied. These cases are typical for a MV industrial grid and a wind park (WP) collection grid. Furthermore, the case with and without surge arrester protection is analyzed in order to observe the impact of the surge arresters on the voltage surges. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage surges exceeds the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Furthermore, the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter compared to the rise time of the lightning impulse {{especially in the case of}} the <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformers</b> and the WP collection grid.

ABB {{is the biggest}} producer and have two types of pods, Azipod (5 - 30 MW) and Compact (0. 4 - 5 MW). Rolls-Royce (RR) is the second biggest company on the market, producing a pod called Mermaid (5 - 25 MW). The electrical system in pod propulsion normally consists of a transformer, a frequency converter and an electric motor. The transformer is used to divide the system into several parts {{in order to obtain}} different voltage levels but also for phase shifting. The purpose of the frequency converter is to control the speed and torque of the motor by changing constant frequency into variable frequency. The electric motor is used for conversion from electrical to mechanical power. In all applications with electric motors, current that travel from the shaft trough the bearings is a phenomena. There are two categories of causes of bearing current, a classical problem where low frequency current and a newer high frequency current problem that occur when using high switching control. To mitigate currents in bearings grounding of the shaft and insulation of the bearings is used. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformer.</b> The non-drive end bearing is insulated and the shaft is grounded to earth in drive end and to the bearing house in non-drive end.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{study of}} high {{frequency}} electromagnetic transient phenomena is performed. Models of various components needed for simulations of high frequency transients, such as for transformers, cables and breakers are developed. Measurements were performed in Chalmers research laboratory {{as well as at}} ABB Corporate Research in Västerås, Sweden for the purpose of parameter estimation of models and for verification of simulations. Critical cases where the voltage surges of the magnitude and/or rise time above basic lightning impulse voltage level appear, are identified. Also, some transient protection schemes are analyzed and the performance of different transient mitigation devices is studied. Furthermore, the voltage distribution along the winding during very fast transients is studied in order to estimate turn-to-turn voltages and the critical voltage envelope. In the work it was found that simulations of the high frequency transients are in a very good agreement with the measurements obtained in the laboratory. Simulations predicted accurately critical surges with the highest magnitude and matched with good accuracy surge waveforms recorded during the measurements. The accuracy of the rise times is within 10 %, while the magnitudes during the critical cases are within a 5 % margin. During the testing and simulations, surges which exceed the basic lightning impulse voltage level of dry-type transformers specified by IEEE standards, both in magnitude and rise time are observed at the transformers even when surge arresters are used to protect the transformers. Furthermore, obtained voltage surges exceeded the proposed critical voltage envelope. It is shown that the most critical voltage strikes are obtained with dry-type transformers, where the rise time is five to ten times shorter compared to oil-insulated transformer with the same rating. It was confirmed both in simulations and measurements that the use of additional transient protections devices such as surge capacitors and RC protections, decreased the magnitude of surges to be below the critical level. The analysis of the voltage during very fast transients showed that the rise time of the transients directly influences the magnitude of the turn-to-turn voltages. Furthermore, during the breaker closing transient, turn-to-turn voltages, measured in delta connected dry-type transformers, were 2. 5 times higher than the voltages obtained during the same transient with a wye connected <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformer,</b> or during the stress with a 4. 4 p. u. lightning impulse voltage...|$|E

An earlier determination study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory determined that cost-effective, technically feasible energy savings could be achieved by distribution transformer standards and that these savings are significant relative to other product conservation standards. This study was documented in a final report, ``Determination Analysis of Energy Conservation Standards for Distribution Transformers`` (ORNL- 6847, July 1996). The energy conservation options analyzed in this study were estimated to save 5. 2 to 13. 7 quads from 2000 [...] 2030. The energy savings for the determination study cases have been revised downward for a number of reasons. The transformer market, both present and future, was overestimated in the previous study, particularly for <b>dry-type</b> <b>transformers,</b> which have the greatest energy-saving potential. Moreover, a revision downwards of the effective annual loads for utility owned transformers also results in lower energy savings.

According to these new estimates, the savings ranged from 2. 5 to 10. 7 quads of primary energy for the 30 -year period 2004 to 2034.

Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank.

With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|R
