30|$|For instance, {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> will occupy more densely vegetated habitats that provide nest protection and arthropods for developing young (Wheelwright and Rising 1993). However, during the winter, <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> become primarily ground-foraging seed-eaters {{that tend to}} feed as gregarious flocks in open areas (Grzybowski 1983 a, b; Wheelwright and Rising 1993). Our results confirm this habitat use pattern where we observed higher densities of <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> in recently burned patches compared to older patches. Exploiting recently burned areas with less plant cover could facilitate food discovery but increase their exposure to predators. <b>Savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> may mitigate this risk in winter by foraging in gregarious flocks and flushing readily to woody cover when disturbed. Balancing this risk-reward scenario could explain why we found that <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrow</b> abundance was associated with reduced plant cover and increasing shrub density.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{function}} of acoustic signals in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> Passerculus) sandwichensis, by analyzing temporal variation in vocal activity, and by conducting a playback experiment. In my first data chapter, I analyze longUterm acoustic recordings to study diel and seasonal variation in vocal activity of <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> I show that singing activity of male <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> varies with time of day, time of year, and breeding stage. Males exhibit {{the highest level of}} song output in May, upon arrival on the breeding grounds, and the lowest level in August, before departure from the breeding grounds. Song output peaks in the early morning, consistent with dawn chorus behaviour, but this pattern is common only prior to pairing; after pairing the dawn chorus is reduced and male song output peaks in the evening, consistent with dusk chorus behaviour. These patterns suggest that dawn choruses serve a territorial function whereas dusk choruses serve a femaleUrelated function in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> In my second data chapter, I present the results of a playback experiment designed to test whether <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> signal their intention to attack a rival male. I simulated an intruder using song playback and a taxidermic model, and explored which behaviors were associated with physical attack. <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> produce soft songs and chip calls at significantly higher levels before attacking rivals, whereas three other measured behaviors (aggressive calls, wing waving, and passes over the model) do not predict attack. My research advances the field of animal communication and provides a foundation for future research on signal function and social interactions involving vocal signals...|$|R

40|$|Basic nesting {{information}} on grassland passerines {{is needed for}} improving grassland bird management. Among the information needs are (1) the suitability of nesting habitat, (2) periods during the breeding season in which birds are most vulnerable to disturbances, and (3) how to fit grasslands into a priori- tization scheme for conservation. Comparisons of nesting parameters among grassland species will help identify important management considerations. We describe and compare nest-site characteristics, nesting phenology, clutch size, hatching and fledging success, and brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) for three grassland passerine species nesting in tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota. During 1998 - 2002, we found 793 Clay-colored Sparrow (Spizella pallida), 687 <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (Passerculus sandwichensis), and 315 Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) nests. These species differed in many aspects of their breeding ecology. Clay-colored and <b>Savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> initiated their nests almost 2 weeks earlier than Bobolinks, with peak nesting occurring in June. Clutch size was lower (3. 77 ± 0. 03 SE) for Clay- colored <b>Sparrows</b> than <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (4. 13 ± 0. 05) and Bobolinks (5. 25 ± 0. 08). The number of host eggs hatched per nest was higher in Bobolinks (3. 46 ± 0. 20) than in Clay-colored Sparrows (2. 52 ± 0. 09) and <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (2. 41 ± 0. 11), {{but the number of}} young fledged per Bobolink nest (1. 97) was similar to that of <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (2. 01). Clay-colored Sparrows fledged only 1. 35 host young per nest. Mayfield nest success was higher for <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (31. 4 %) than for Clay-colored Sparrows (27. 4 %) or Bobolinks (20. 7 %). The main cause of nest failure was nest predation: predation in Clay-colored Sparrows (47. 9 %) was higher than in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (33. 5 %) but similar to Bobolinks (41. 8 %). Brood parasitism was lower in Clay-colored Sparrows (5. 1 %) than in Bobolinks (10. 8 %), and intermediate (6. 7 %) in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> Compared with most other studies, grassland bird nests in our study area were more successful and less frequently parasitized; thus, northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota appear to provide important breeding habitat for grassland birds...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years North American {{grassland}} bird populations have declined {{more than any}} other bird guild. This trend is especially evident in Vermont, where species experiencing precipitous declines include the <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). These declines are linked to habitat loss due to reforestation and suburbanization as well as the intensification of grassland management. Modern grassland management includes earlier first-haying dates (late-May) and shorter intervals between haying events (35 days). These management practices have severe repercussions for songbird populations because 1) early-haying results in complete nest failure (99 % <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrow</b> and 100 % Bobolink nests), 2) the interval {{between the first and second}} haying is too short for birds to renest, and 3) intensively managed fields comprise a significant portion of the total available habitat (as much as 40 %). In 2002 - 2006, I examined how hayfield and pasture management affected grassland songbird ecological and evolutionary behavior in the agricultural landscape of the Champlain Valley, Vermont and New York. I studied songbirds in four grassland management types: early-hayed fields harvested in late-May or early-June and again in mid-July; middle-hayed fields harvested in late-June or early-July; late-hayed fields harvested after 1 August; rotationally-grazed pastures, a matrix of small paddocks where cows are moved after the grass in a paddock is eaten to a low point. I addressed the following objectives: 1. Determined the annual productivity, survival, and recruitment of Bobolinks and <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> in the four treatment types. 2. Identified the effects of early-haying on the social and genetic mating systems of <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> 3. Conducted a population viability analysis for Bobolinks and <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> nesting in the Champlain Valley, assessing sensitivities of life-history parameters and identifying effective management alternatives.

It will help inform landowners, managers, and law-makers about management practices and habitat requirements needed to sustain populations...|$|R

40|$|Salt marshes {{constitute}} habitat islands {{for many}} endemic animal species, particularly along the California coast, where urban sprawl has fragmented this habitat. Recreational activities in salt marshes have increased recently, posing an interesting problem: how do endemic species lacking alternative habitat modify their tolerance to humans? We assessed seasonal and site variations in three tolerance parameters (distances at which animals became alert, fled, and moved after fleeing) of California&# 039;s endangered Belding&# 8217;s <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrow</b> ((Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi). We approached individuals on trails in three salt marshes with {{different levels of}} vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Belding&# 8217;s <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> became aware and fled at shorter distances in the salt marsh coincident with greater levels of recreational activity {{as a result of}} habituation or visual obstruction effects. Seasonal effects in tolerance varied between sites. Alert and flight initiation distances were higher in the pre-nesting than in the non-breeding season in the site with the highest levels of recreational use likely due to greater exposure of breeding individuals; however, the opposite seasonal trend was found in each of the two sites with relatively lower human use, probably because individuals were less spatially attached in the non-breeding season when they foraged in aggregations. Distance fled was greater in the non-breeding than in the breeding season. Our findings call for dynamic management of recreational activities in different salt marshes depending on the degree of exposure to humans and seasonal variations in tolerance. We recommend a minimum approaching distance of 63 m and buffer areas of 1. 3 ha around Belding&# 039;s <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows...</b>|$|R
