5|$|Accession to EU {{required}} {{a new law}} compliant with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized <b>gun</b> <b>ownership,</b> for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of license holders started to rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly {{prompted}} by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms. Average annual rise in {{the number of}} registered firearms amounted to 14,500 guns between 2006 and 2014, there were 54,508 new registered firearms in 2015 alone. Local tendencies generally follow the nationwide trend, however any worsening of security in any given district is often followed by a sharp rise in <b>gun</b> <b>ownership</b> therein. For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of <b>gun</b> <b>ownership</b> in Šluknov Hook area.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private <b>gun</b> <b>ownership</b> (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E

5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to <b>gun</b> <b>ownership</b> should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a {{right to keep and}} bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal <b>gun</b> <b>ownership</b> and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far more men volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. There were plenty of personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply.

50|$|The Hughes Amendment in the Firearm Owners Protection Act {{prohibited}} the ATF from accepting any new registrations of machine <b>guns</b> for civilian <b>ownership</b> after May 19, 1986. Due to their scarcity {{and the fact}} that no new HK33/53 rifles can be produced for the civilian market, the value of these Title II firearms keeps going up year after year. The average price for one of these HK33/53 conversions is about $18,000. Those that have the push-pin style grip attachment are considered to be the most authentic reproductions of factory HK33/53 rifles and thus command a premium.|$|R

40|$|Because {{they are}} seen as advocates for public health and safety, {{physicians}} are also widely believed to be supporters of aggressive gun-control measures, but in reality there are strong feelings {{on both sides of}} the issue. "People assume that more gun control will mean less violence, but there are no hard data to support that," says Vancouver psychiatrist Joseph Noone, who argues that Canada already has highly restrictive firearms laws. Other physicians are puzzled by colleagues' opposition to the changes. "I don't understand why it's such a big deal," says Dr. Stephen Corber, medical officer of health for the Ottawa-Carleton region. He argues that registration would not be a deterrent to responsible <b>gun</b> use and <b>ownership...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Proponents of ghost guns include gun {{rights activists}} and anarchists. They say that making weapons {{is the right}} of every American which {{maintains}} the privacy of gun owners.

One organizer in California advertised, [...] "No Serial Numbers, No Registration, No Big Brother...We Host Build Parties." [...] The same vendor predicted he would sell 75,000 unfinished receivers in 2014. The ATF raided his store that year and confiscated 6,000 receiver blanks which they said were too close to finished units.

40|$|Contrary {{to public}} claims by the gun {{industry}} and the <b>gun</b> lobby, firearms <b>ownership</b> has declined dramatically over the past 35 years according to new survey data from the General Social Survey (GSS) released today by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. Except for the U. S. Census, the GSS is the most frequently analyzed source of information {{in the social sciences}} and is the only survey that has tracked the opinions of Americans {{over an extended period of}} time. The NORC data comes out the same week that the National Rifle Association (NRA) begins its annual convention this Thursday in St. Louis, MO. The NORC data shows that during the period 1972 to 2006, the percentage of American households that reported having any guns in the home has dropped nearly 20 percentage points: from a high of 54 percent in 1977 to 34. 5 percent in 2006. The data also shows that during the period 1980 to 2006, the percentage of Americans who reported personally owning a gun dropped more than nine percentage points: from a high of 30. 7 percent in 1985 to a low during the survey period of 21. 6 percent in 2006...|$|R
25|$|As {{this case}} {{is the latest in}} a lineage of {{high-profile}} cases, such as DeShaney v.

5000|$|The Browning M1919 remains {{popular with}} {{civilian}} enthusiasts in the United States, though changes in 1986 to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the US Federal law regulating private <b>ownership</b> of machine <b>guns)</b> prohibited the registration of new machine guns for sales to private citizens, thus freezing {{the number of}} [...] "transferable" [...] machine <b>guns</b> in private <b>ownership.</b> The inflation of prices that followed, {{and the availability of}} parts from surplussed and scrapped machine guns, {{led to the development of}} semi-automatic versions of the Browning M1919. Typically, these are built using a new right sideplate (the portion legally considered the [...] "firearm" [...] under US law), which has a raised [...] "island" [...] protruding into the interior of the receiver. This requires the use of a modified bolt, barrel extension and lock frame which have been designed to allow only semi-automatic firing. The [...] "island" [...] prevents the insertion of unmodified full-automatic parts. A number of small gun companies have produced these [...] "semi-auto machine guns" [...] for commercial sales. The fairly simple modifications necessary to convert M1919 parts to the semi-automatic version, and the relatively easy process of riveting used in the assembly of the Browning machine gun's receiver, have also made it a popular gun for hobbyists to build at home.|$|R
40|$|GUNS. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Adds and amends {{statutes}} concerning ownership, registration, {{and sale}} of guns. Requires that all concealable firearms be registered by November 2, 1983. Makes registration information confidential. Specifies procedures concerning sale and transfer of registered guns by dealers and private parties. Restricts Legislature 2 ̆ 7 s authority to enact laws: (1) prohibiting <b>ownership</b> of registered <b>guns,</b> (2) banning <b>ownership</b> or sale or requiring registration of shotguns and long rifles. Limits number of concealable firearms to number in circulation in California on April 30, 1983. Specifies violation penalties.

Fiscal impact on state and local governments: The Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance advise that the adoption of this measure would have an undeterminable impact on state and local finances. They estimate {{that there would be}} undeterminable net changes in state and local administrative costs because (a) new administrative responsibilities would be financed by fees charged to affected handgun owners, (b) there would be substantial annual state savings from the discontinuance of the Attorney General 2 ̆ 7 s gun sale registration system but (c) there could be potential undeterminable increased costs for the Attorney General to perform activities required by the initiative; that the limit on the number of handguns, and the restrictions on sales by governmental entities, would reduce state and local revenues by an unknown amount; and that there could be other undeterminable costs or savings...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} {{examined the}} correlation between impulsivity, gun and substance usage. These studies isolated two variables at a time, while there was limited research that analyzed {{all three of these}} factors. It is widely debated whether substance usage increases aggression, thus making individuals more likely to commit gun crime, or individuals commit crimes with guns in order to uphold their drug habits (Williams-Reid, 2001). Impulsivity increased with a longer drug-use habit for alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, hallucinogens but not for marijuana (Bernstein et al., 2014). Positive gun views were associated with impulsive and aggressive tendencies (Martin et al., 2001). We put forth a survey which consisted of three parts: hypothetical gun use, the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001) and a substance use screening. Our hypothetical statements examined topics such as self-defense, protection of others and proximity to crime. The UPPS Impulsivity scale is divided into four sub-scales: urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of premeditation and sensation seeking. We hypothesized that different substances will be correlated with individual subscales; gun use will be correlated with all subscales except for lack of perseverance. A sample of 100 students averaging 22 years of age participated in the study (56 % female, 42 % male). Our findings showed that <b>gun</b> experience and <b>ownership</b> were correlated with sensation seeking. Results varied throughout the hypothetical gun scenarios. The use of marijuana, depressants and stimulants was correlated with high impulsivity, while the four subscales of impulsivity were divided among substance categories. Suicidal thoughts were highly correlated with impulsivity, including 3 out 4 subscales. In the future we are interested in investigating scenarios that are based on criminal activity rather than ethical reasoning. We would also like to expand our sample to forensic and clinical populations in order further investigate correlations involving suicidality and criminal activity...|$|R
