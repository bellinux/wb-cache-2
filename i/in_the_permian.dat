5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians {{appear to have}} arisen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian.</b> Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carboniferous, but {{the first member of}} Batrachia (frogs and salamanders, but not caecilians) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian.</b> Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian</b> period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E

5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian</b> (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian sandstones are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}}s of many small Texas towns had even greater population increases when oil discoveries brought prospectors, investors, field laborers, and businessmen. Between 1920 and 1922, {{the town of}} Breckenridge in rural North Texas grew from about 1,500 people to nearly 30,000. Between 1925 and 1929, the town of Odessa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian</b> Basin grew from 750 to 5,000. Between 1924 and 1925, the town of Wortham in northern Texas grew from 1,000 to about 30,000. The town of Kilgore in eastern Texas grew from about 500 to 12,000 between 1930 and 1936 following {{the discovery of the}} East Texas field.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian</b> {{and all are}} amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Cicadomorpha first {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Permian.</b> <b>The</b> superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. <b>The</b> Upper <b>Permian</b> Dunstaniidae {{are found in}} Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China.

5|$|Temnospondyli {{became a}} {{commonly}} used {{name at the}} turn of the century. Paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group. Cope's Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta fell out of use. In 1919, British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae. Embolomerous forms in the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian,</b> and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic. More importantly, Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups. The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed. Swedish paleontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group, narrowing its scope to rhachitomes and stereospondyls. His classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites may {{go back to the}} Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian</b> layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are {{more closely related to}} each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian,</b> rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, {{came to the conclusion that}} Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|In Euramerica, the Lepospondyli, {{a host of}} small, mostly aquatic {{amphibians}} of uncertain phylogeny, {{appeared in}} the Carboniferous.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permian,</b> the new {{continent}} and another terrane, Armorica which included Iberia, drifted in from Gondwana, trapping Avalonia {{between it and}} the continent so adding Iberia/Armorica to Euramerica. This was followed up by the arrival of Gondwana. The effects of these collisions are seen in Europe as the Variscan folding. In North America it shows as later phases of the Acadian orogeny. This was happening at around the Equator during the later Carboniferous, forming Pangaea {{in such a way that}} Avalonia was near its centre but partially flooded by shallow sea.|$|E
