50|$|The main {{process in}} the {{formation}} of podzols is podzolisation. Podzolisation is a complex process (or number of sub-processes) in which organic material and soluble minerals (commonly iron and aluminium) are leached from the A and E horizons to the B horizon. It involves mobilization and precipitation of dissolved organic matter, together with aluminum and iron as they leach down from the A and E horizons to the B horizon. Through this process the overlying <b>eluvial</b> <b>horizons</b> are bleached. The complexes move to the brown, red or black horizon, which consist of cemented sesquioxides and/or organic compounds.

The soil samples used in this work were taken from the rice fields situated near on the tops of the hills which were different in their composing materials and these soils had B-horizons having a great deal of the blackish brown mottling. The clay fractions(< 2 μ) were separated from the soil samples after treatment with H_ 2 O_ 2 to remove organic matter, and were examined by the x-ray, thermal, chemical, electron microscopic, and glycol retention methods on the calcium or sodium clays. It is concluded that (a) the predominant minerals were montmorillonoid and illite in the Mera profile which was derived from the shales and sandstones of the Tertiary origin, (b) the Tani profile developed on the weathered andesite had hydrated halloysite, allophone, hallysite, and gibbsite, (c) vermiculite, illite, hydrated halloysite, halloysite, and quartz occurred in the Fukuma profile derived from diluvial deposits. The clay fractions of the A-horizons were found to be less in iron and manganese contents, and somewhat higher in the silica-alumina ratios than the clays from the B- or C horizons, respectively, but any definite tendency was not observed among the clays of the horizons in other characteristics. It is suggested that the kind of the clay minerals in the paddy soils examined was closely related to the parent materials and not to the paddy field state. 水田の表層土は夏季の湛水期に還元状態を呈し，亜酸化鉄と亜酸化マンガンが存在する．地下水位が低くて水が表層から下層に移動する水田では，亜酸化態のこれ等重金属イオンは滲透水に伴われて表層土から溶脱する．そして下層土が酸化層をなす場合は亜酸化態のこれ等イオンはここで酸化態となり溶解度を減じて沈積する．かくして多くの乾田土壌では赤褐色乃至黄褐色の哲を主とする凝塊と，黒褐乃至紫黒色のマンガンの多い凝塊が下層土に認められる．そして下層土の酸化還元電位が充分に高い場合にはマンガンを多量に含む沈積物が耕土の直下から現われる，このような土壌の分布は広くはないが，丘陵地の上部のように排水の甚だ良好な，或は灌漑がしばしば杜絶して田面が露出するような状態，すなわち下層土が高い酸化状態に保たれるか或は耕土の還元が充分に進まない条件下で認められる．この種の土壌は乾田土壌の特徴である鉄の溶脱集積よりも，マンガンのそれが特に顕著であり，かつその集積は耕土に比較的に近い下層土において行われている．このことは溶脱現象という観点からすれば，水田土壌化作用の進行が比較的に初期段階にある或は軽微であることを意味するといえる．水田土壌の粘土鉱物に関する研究成績は発表されたものが比較的に少なく，土壌を水田状態に維持管理する場合に粘土鉱物はどのような性質を示し，また変遷過程を辿るかについてはまだ多くの論議は許されない．ここにおいて著者等は日本の水田土壌の粘土鉱物について知見を加えるために，まず水田土壌化の最も軽微であると思われるこの種の土壌を試料として，その粘土の性質及び鉱物の種類をしらべた．そしてこれ等の試料とは反対に溶脱のいちじるしい所謂老朽化水田土壌に就いても研究を行つたが，後者の結果は別に報告の予定である．本研究に要した経費の一部は文部科学省科学研究費によつて支弁した．また試料の採取に当たつて山崎欣多及び長森与次郎の両氏の支援を受け，実験の一部は石井企救男及び鬼鞍豊の両学士が行つた．ここに深甚の感謝を表明したい...|$|E

Soils of increasing age (6500 - 9850 y BP) were selected to represent a chronosequence of soil development. Expandable phyllosilicates (vermiculite, smectites) are formed in the <b>eluvial</b> E <b>horizon</b> of podzols {{in a short time}} (6500 y). TEM observations show that dissolution and physical-breakdown pro-cesses affect the clay particles.

The chemical compositions of individual particles obtained by AEM indicate that expandable phyllosilicates from the E horizon of podzols are heterogeneous, involving a mixture of vermiculite, Mg-bearing smectites, and aluminous beidellite. Results suggest hat heterogeneity is related to the nature of their precursors. Vermiculite and Mg-bearing smectites are derived from biotite and chlorite weathering whereas phengitic micas alter to aluminous beidellite. Because the transformation f biotite and chlorite is more rapid than phengitic micas, biotite and chlorite contributes predominantly to smectites in the younger soils, as long as ferromagnesian phyllosilicates are present in the E horizons.

In situ penetration tests and laboratory Bishop-Wesley cell tests were undertaken for the two main soil horizons of a beech high-forest, i. e. the <b>eluvial</b> E <b>horizon</b> (5 - 30 cm depth) and the underlying clay-enriched Bt horizon (30 - 60 cm depth). Both undisturbed and wheel-rutted soil areas were studied (E and Bt horizons vs. Eg and Btg horizons). Results show that: The experimental overconsolidation pressure of the <b>eluvial</b> reference <b>horizon</b> (E) is about 50 kPa higher than the value calculated from soil overburden pressure; this probably results from suction action during dry periods. The clay-enriched reference horizon (Bt) shows the same trends. In wheel-rutted areas, seven years after logging operations, the Eg horizon memorizes only 14. 5 % of the wheel induced stress due to forest machinery. In the compacted Btg horizon, the experimental overconsolidation pressure represents 96 % of the exerted theoretical stresses due to harvesting actions. The good recording of the exerted stresses, after seven years, can be explained by: (1) The Btg depth which keeps it from seasonal variations i. e. from desiccation-moistening or freeze-thaw cycling; (2) amorphous and free iron accumulation inducing a "glue" effect of the Btg soil matrix, which could stabilize the soil structure and prevent recovery to initial conditions. These results provide clear evidence that on loessic materials, soil compaction due to logging operations leads to modifications in both physical (bulk density, total porosity) and mechanical (penetration resistance and consolidation pressure) soil properties. © 2003 ISTVS.

The present paper discusses the geographical distribution of two forms (total and water-soluble) of selenium in topsoil (plough layer for cultivated soils, <b>eluvial</b> <b>horizon</b> for natural soils) and evaluates its relationship with some human health problems in China. Topsoil samples, 354 in total, including 156 natural and 198 cultivated soils of 21 main soil types were collected. The total Se concentration in soil samples was determined with DAN (diaminonaphthalene) -fluorescence spectrophotometer method. Soil water-soluble Se concentration was determined with the same method after extraction with water (water/soil = 5 : 1). The {{results showed that the}} geometric and arithmetic means of total Se concentration in soil, for all samples, were 0. 173 mg/kg and 0. 239 mg/kg, respectively, with the lowest value being 0. 022 mg/kg and the highest being 3. 806 mg/kg. For the cultivated soil, the geometric mean of total Se was 0. 188 mg/kg, its arithmetic mean was 0. 269 mg/kg and higher than those in the natural soil, 0. 154 mg/kg and 0. 206 mg/kg, respectively. The geometric and arithmetic means of water-soluble Se in soil for all the samples were 4. 0 and 6. 4 mug/kg, the lowest 0. 6 mug/kg and the highest value being 109. 4 mug/kg. For the cultivated soils, the average concentration of water-soluble Se was 4. 3 mug/kg, similar to that of natural soil, they are and 4. 4 mug/kg by geometric mean. Two sequences of the soil types, arranged separately in the concentration of total Se and water-soluble Se, are different and this demonstrates that the proportions of the two forms of selenium existing in various soils are different. The percentages of water-soluble Se to total Se in different types of soils varied from 1. 07 to 6. 69 %. However, generally the laterite and other subtropic soil still have relatively high absolute water-soluble Se contents because of their higher total Se contents. A very significant correlation between total Se and water-soluble Se has been found in cultivated soil with a correlation coefficient of 0. 58 (P < 0. 01). The relationships between soil Se and human endemic diseases Keshan disease, Kashin-Back diseases and selenosis have been discussed.

40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} physical, geochemical and mineralogical {{indicators}} are proposed for the correlation of soil age. The parameters studied allowed the highlighting of trends in soil aging {{as well as the}} relating of these trends to specific soil forming processes. Soil aging was marked by a progressive increase in clay content and a decrease in silt/clay ratio, a slight reduction in the CEC of clay and a striking increase in free iron content. Clay mineralogy transformation over time was marked by a progressive increase in kaolinite and vermiculite, as well as a decrease in illite and chlorite. The most outstanding pedological processes, i. e. crystalline free iron content increase, clay neo-genesis and illuviation, glossic horizon and fragipan formation, were all found to be related to kaolinite content. Element content, namely that of Fe, Cr, Pb, Zn, Ti and K increased from the Holocene to the Upper and Middle Pleistocene soil horizons and, as far as Fe, Cr, Pb and Zn are concerned, up to those attributed to the Lower Pleistocene. Al and Ca content decreased along with time, especially in soils older than Holocene. The trends of silt/clay ratio, CEC of clay and free iron were linear, that is not influenced by changes of weathering conditions during Pleistocene, while vermiculite and kaolinite content, total iron, chromium and lead distinguished the stronger weathering environment occurring during Lower Pleistocene in southern Europe. The tendencies of the remaining indicators revealed intermediate phases of mineral transformation or were influenced by rather fast processes. Besides soil age, the indicators resulted as being affected by clay impoverishment, which occurred within <b>eluvial</b> <b>horizons</b> and bleached streaks of fragipan, reducing and oxidizing conditions, an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study of the process of {{vertical}} migration of phosphogypsum components according to the soil profile. The qualitative and quantitative identification of main biogenic elements (phosphorus, sulphur, calcium etc) and heavy metals in lysimetric solutions from various horizons while getting on the surface of soil solutions containing phosphogypsum components is carried out by means of designed laboratory and experimental complex. The mineral hard soil fraction is also analysed. According to the results of the X-ray diffractometrical researches, the carbonates with heavy metals in their structure, caused by the ion-exchange with Са 2 +, were found in the mineral structure of the illuvial horizon soil samples. The results of experimental modeling indicate significant changes in the chemical parameters of groundwater, which are obtained by passing water with phosphogypsum particles on a model soil profile, which makes it easy to track the input data. In {{the upper part of the}} profile after 1 000 hours and for the first speed of the infiltration process, the constant moisture level was 25, 6 %, after the second speed of infiltration, it rose to 29. 1 %. Noted that the highest concentration of biogenic elements (calcium, sulfur, potassium) was found in lysimetric solutions obtained from the humus and <b>eluvial</b> <b>horizons.</b> In addition, it is determined that iron is present up to 5 %, nickel – within the range of 1 – 3 %, and copper – up to 1 %. It should be noted that the biochemical transformations of silicon influence the fractional distribution of heavy metals, which can be fixed by sorption-sedimentation mechanisms in silica, oligo and polysilicon compounds, as well as in crystalline lattice structures of clay minerals, quartz, etc. The model of soil and geochemical situation was formed according to the soil profile under the influence of the phosphogypsum within the three-dimensional surface, developed with the help of the stochastic reconstructions based on the images of the scan electron microscopes...|$|R

40|$|Paleosols crop {{out in the}} Sukhona River valley {{as several}} members up to 10 m thick {{embedded}} into the Salarevo Formation sediments. Principal characteristics of the paleosols include a dense network of root channels, indications of eluvial gley alteration, redistribution and formation of secondary carbonates represented by several generations, and formation of block-prismatic soil structure with specific clayey films at structural jointing faces. The paleosols are divided {{into a number of}} genetically interrelated horizons (from top to bottom) : presumably organogenic accumulation (AElg), <b>eluvial</b> gley <b>horizon</b> (Elg), illuvial horizons (B 1 and B 2), illuvial gley horizon (Bg), and transitional horizons (ElBg and BElg). The paleosols formed under conditions of a semiarid climate with sharp seasonal or secular and multisecular oscillations of atmospheric precipitation. Such soils point to specific ecological environments existed in the northern semiarid belt of the Earth before the greatest (in Phanerozoic) biospheric crisis at the Permian-Triassic boundary...|$|R
