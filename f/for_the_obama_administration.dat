25|$|The Egyptian protests {{became the}} most {{critical}} foreign policy crisis so far <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration,</b> and Obama came to increasingly rely upon Clinton for advice and connections. Clinton had known Mubarak for some twenty years, and had formed {{a close relationship with}} Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak by supporting the latter's human rights work. Clinton originated the idea of sending Frank G. Wisner as an emissary to Cairo, to tell Mubarak not to seek another term as the country's leader. As Mubarak's response to the protests became violent in early February, Clinton strongly condemned the actions taking place, especially those against journalists covering the events, and urged new Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman to conduct an official investigation to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. When Wisner baldly stated that Mubarak's departure should be delayed to accommodate an orderly transition to another government, Clinton rebuked him, but shared a bit of the same sentiment. Mubarak did finally step down on February 11 as the protests became the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Clinton said that the U.S. realized that Egypt still had much work and some difficult times ahead of it. In mid-March, Clinton visited Egypt and indicated support for an Egyptian move towards democracy, but she avoided specific issues of U.S. aid and when elections should take place.|$|E

2500|$|In their {{court papers}} on September 14, 2012 {{government}} lawyers said the plaintiffs had no basis to fear being {{locked up for}} their activities, and that the judge's order interfered with the president's powers {{at a time of}} war.

They called the permanent injunction an [...] "extraordinary injunction of worldwide scope." [...] Lawyers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> also argued that the United States will be irreparably harmed if it has to abide by a judge's ruling that it can no longer hold terrorism suspects indefinitely without trial in military custody. The government said that the injunction was an [...] "unprecedented" [...] trespass on power of the president and the legislature that by its very nature was doing irreparable harm. They also argued that the injunction places an undue burden on military commanders {{in a time of war}} while the plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of ever being detained [...] "in the foreseeable future." [...] The Court's injunction against application of section 1021 'in any manner, as to any person,'... combined with its mistaken view that section 1021 goes beyond reaffirming the authority contained in the AUMF, could impose entirely unjustified burdens on military officials worldwide, complicating the ability to carry out an armed conflict authorized by Congress in the public interest... Given the absence of any risk of impending harm to plaintiffs, the serious injury to the government and the public interest in the invalidation of a statute enacted by public representatives, and the possible effect on an ongoing armed conflict and the Executive's prerogatives in military affairs, a stay is necessary.|$|E
