50|$|Article 107 of the {{constitution}} regulates the <b>horizontal</b> <b>payments</b> between the states. Tax revenues assigned to a state are no longer allocated based on the location in which the tax arises, but instead {{based on the number}} of residents; so income tax revenue belongs to the state in which the resident lives and corporation tax revenue belongs to the state in which the taxable economic performance arises. An exception to this rule is a state's share of value added tax revenue; up to a quarter of a state's tax revenue can be assigned to especially weak states in advance. The equalization payments are being stepped up, the states entitled to payment adjustments should now receive 95% of the average of all states' revenue compared to 91% in the past.|$|E
