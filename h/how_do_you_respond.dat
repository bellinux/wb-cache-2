5000|$|When Kyle {{decides to}} hold a sale at the car yard to bring in extra revenue, it attracts the {{attention}} of Constable Wes Holland (Daniel Hamill). Wes demands money from Kyle in return for providing security for the event. Kyle is stunned and Milligan told Inside Soap {{that he does not}} know how to react. The actor explained [...] "Holland makes it clear that if Kyle doesn't pay up, big trouble will come his way - and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to that?" [...] Kyle is shaken up by the confrontation with Wes and he turns to Kate, who advises him to speak to Mark. Kyle is reluctant because of his history with the detective. However, when Kyle returns to the car yard to remove the sale signs, he gets another visit from Wes. The officer gets physical with Kyle and threatens to destroy his stock. Kyle then decides to go to Mark for help. Kyle explains the situation to Mark, but the story is not very believable. Milligan said [...] "At first it isn't easy for them to work together because it's hard for Kyle to seek help off someone he's already had problems with, and he knows how Brennan feels about him - plus it's another cop, so he isn't convinced that Brennan will believe him." [...] Mark is under the impression Wes is a trusted colleague, so he decides to get proof before he believes Kyle. Mark finds the evidence he needs and he and Kyle confront Wes. When asked if the situation would be a turning point for Kyle and Mark, Milligan said that it was. He added while they would not become best friends, they would not be enemies either.|$|E

Are you willing to show contrition, admit that you bet on {{baseball}} and make some sort of apology to that effect?Pete Rose: Not at all, Jim. Im not going to admit to something that didnt happen. I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team. Im just a small part of a big deal tonight.Gray: With the overwhelming evidence in that report, why not make that step...Rose: No. This is too much of a festive night to worry about that because I dont know what evidence youre talking about. I mean, show it to me...Gray: Well, the Dowd Report says- but we dont want to debate that, Pete.Rose: Well, why not? Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban. Why did you sign it if you didnt agree with it?Rose: It also says I can apply for reinstatement after one year, if you remember correctly. In the press conference, as a matter of fact, my statement was [...] "I cant wait for my little girl to be a year old so I can apply for reinstatement". At my press conference. So you forgot to add that clause that was in there.Gray: Well, you have reapplied. ... Youve applied for reinstatement in 1997. Have you heard back from Commissioner Selig?Rose: No, and that kind of surprises me. Its only been two years, though, and hes got a lot of things on his mind. But I hope to some day.Gray: Pete, its been 10 years since youve been allowed on the field. Obviously, the approach that you have taken has not worked. Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to that?Rose: In what way are you talking about?Gray: By not acknowledging what seems to be overwhelming evidence.Rose: Yeah, Im surprised youre bombarding me like this. I mean Im doing an interview with you on a great night, a great occasion, a great ovation. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. And youre bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.Gray: Im bringing it up because I think people would like to see ... Pete, weve got to go, weve got a game.Rose: This is a prosecutors brief, not an interview, and Im very surprised at you. I am, really.Gray: Some would be surprised that you didnt take the opportunity.|$|E

How accurate is the chemical imbalance explanation for depression? How widely do laypersons agree with the explanation, and how do they interpret the explanation? We discuss the origins, accuracy, and transmittal (e. g., via direct-to-consumer advertising) of the chemical imbalance explanation for depression. We next present results from a group case study examining lay endorsement and interpretation of the explanation. Finally, we discuss clinical implications and present a short script for educating clients concerning “chemical imbalances ” in depression...|$|E

This {{study has}} two aims: 1) to explore {{classroom}} teachers ’ experiences regarding the presenting psychological difficulties of their students; and, 2) {{to understand how}} they try to help those students {{and whether or not}} their intervention is effective. This study is qualitative in nature. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 35 volunteer teachers from primary and high schools located in different parts of Ankara. The subjects taught by the participating teachers varied. Each participant was asked the following questions: 1 -Based on your experiences, what are the psychological difficulties most often faced by your students? 2 - <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to their presenting psychological difficulties? and, 3 - Do you think that your responses are effective? Descriptive and content analysis procedures were utilized. Four categories of psychological difficulties and six categories of widely used intervention strategies were identified.

PROFESSOR GOLDSTEIN: If this is the effect, it is certainly contrary to everything we propose. First of all, we {{say that it is}} an obligation of state agencies to make every possible effort to maintain children in their own family setting. Second, we urge that every effort be made to maintain the continuity of ties with the family from whom the child has been removed. It is—or at least it should be—a function of foster parents to keep alive these ties and bonds because the primary goal of temporary placement is to restore a child as quickly as possible to the family from which she came...|$|E

Tateishi purposefully uses second-person, direct-address {{to appeal to the}} reader and model the methods of advertisers. When he writes, “By purchasing this product, you are freeing yourself of the monotonous burdens that have plagued your current lifestyle,” <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond?</b> Is the tone conversational, moralistic, engaging? While Tateishi relies on both pathos and ethos to appeal to his reader, can you recognize appeals to reason and logic as well? Consider Tateishi’s command of language. He uses active verbs such as “welcomes,” “horse-shoed,” and “symbolizes. ” Do these verbs give the essay energy and, in turn, paint a more vivid picture in your mind? Though Tateishi’s response is brief, he delves deeply into the content and meaning(s) of the advertisement. What is the difference between summary and analysis? Locate moments where the writer shifts between these two modes to give a fully developed response. For example, the statement, “Color is a major contributor to the ad’s devious message,” is an analytic claim. Overall, how does Tateishi organize the essay? Lastly, notice the conclusion, especially the last line. It is somewhat unsettling and lingers in our minds; Tateishi places the responsibility of being discerning readers of advertisements back on his readers...|$|E

An action research project was undertaken to identify the extent of these conditions and this problem in schools and to make recommendations for teachers and schools about responding for children with life threatening crisis prone medical conditions. Three focus groups were conducted with Brisbane Catholic Education Consultants (Inclusive Education) from seven primary schools and four secondary schools - metropolitan, some rural and one semi rural. A survey was conducted by telephone and email with Principals of 18 schools, to seek exemplars of effective practice in schools to respond to crises for children with crisis prone medical conditions. Data includes how Principals identified these students and what their practices were in dealing with them both at enrolment and when a crisis occurred. Examples of questions that were asked in the focus groups: What crisis prone medical conditions do your students have? What do you understand about these crisis prone medical conditions? Who responds and <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to crises for these students? The data from the focus groups was of mixed usefulness, {{as some of the}} respondents had varying ideas of what constituted a crisis, and of some of these were not life threatening. From the focus groups we were able to determine that the main life threatening crises were Asthma, Diabetes Mellitus, Epilepsy, Anaphylaxis. Several schools identified exemplar responses to the crisis that they were undertaking. From this point we consulted with the Principals about identifying these at risk students at enrolment, and how they identify them and how the school follows up on them. All of this was compiled and analysed and it seemed that mostly the Principals did not have a full picture of the numbers of at risk students. Where they thought they were collecting data on these students at enrolment via forms, the questions being asked on the forms were of an open ended nature. Parents were reporting to these questions using a variety of terminology, and the data collected by the schools was entered into a database verbatim, for example ‘severe asthma’ or ‘allergy to nuts’, but the schools were not able to categorise the responses in a meaningful way, meaning that searches for a particular life threatening crisis on the database would not return reliable numbers and or names of students with this condition. A key recommendation arising from this research was to change how this data was collected at enrolment and to have options on the forms for clear categories like Asthma, Diabetes, Epilepsy and Anaphylaxis. As well, exemplars for practice were recommended and information factsheets were supplied to schools for inclusion in their teacher education...|$|E
