40|$|The paper {{presents}} a hybrid orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) - {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) visible light communication (VLC). Direct detection is adopted in place of complex digital signal processing such as channel estimation and channel equalization, or even <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>corrections.</b> Generic red, green and blue light emitting diodes (LED) are used for high-speed WDM based 3 -channel VLC and white LED for indoor illumination. In each channel, we have used direct current optical OFDM to improve the frequency utilization efficiency.

25|$|COFDM {{stands for}} Coded {{orthogonal}} frequency-division multiplexing. It differs from OFDM because in COFDM, <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> {{is applied to}} the signal before transmission. This is done to overcome errors. COFDM and OFDM are sometimes used as synonyms.|$|E

40|$|Predictive video codecs such as MPEG and H. 26 x {{are very}} {{susceptible}} to prediction mismatch between encoder and decoder or “drift” {{when there are}} packet losses, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} the decoded quality. Targeting backward compatibility with standard predictive video codecs, we propose a method that is conceptually different from conventional error protection schemes and inspired instead by principles from distributed source coding. Extra information is sent over a lower-rate auxiliary channel to correct for errors in the decoded frame and mitigate the drift. We present extensive simulation results to demonstrate that significant gains in performance (of the order of 3 dB in PSNR over FEC-based solutions and 5 dB in PSNR over baseline solutions for typical scenarios) can be achieved over conventional error protection schemes such as <b>Forward</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Corrections</b> Codes under reasonable latency constraints...|$|R
40|$|In EONs, the {{establishment}} of flexi-grid optical connections requires configuring both BVTs and bandwidth variable cross-connects. Such configuration has to be performed through proper control plane architecture and extensions, accounting for the client signal data rate, the required modulation format, the adopted <b>forwarding</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> mechanisms, the number of carriers, and the required spectrum resources. Nowadays, two candidate control plane architectures with similar functions (like endpoint and node addressing, automatic topology discovery, network abstraction, path computation, and connection provisioning) can be adopted: distributed GMPLS - with optional PCE and instantiation/modification - and a control plane based on SDN with a logically centralized controller and an open protocol such as OpenFlow. In this work, by relying on the data modeling of 1 Tb/s SBVTs, we aim to design and provide feasible control plane enhancements for both GMPLS/PCE and SDN/OpenFlow architectures to automatically configure endpoint SBVTs while dynamically establishing end-to-end connections in EONs. Such extensions, successfully validated in experimental scenarios, are qualitatively compared to ease eventual EON operator selection...|$|R

For this AMR system, {{one of the most popular}} approach is using power lines as a communication medium to inject a narrow band spectrum. PRIME is a new Physical and Data Link layers specification for powerline communication in the last mile released in the last two years. The main problem that this technology has to deal with is the severe attenuation that signals suffer due to reflections and fadings. Another important handicap is the time varying response of the channel produced by impulsive noise. This paper focuses on PRIME s physical specification and describes its details and procedures to overcome the previously mentioned problems. A model, developed in Matlab, implements and integrates the <b>Forward</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Corrections</b> (FEC) and modulation techniques described in the standard. Together with the transmitter and receiver, a channel model was created following previous studies found in the literature.

25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and <b>Forward</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Correction</b> encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E
25|$|The Sirius {{signal is}} {{separated}} into three carriers, one each {{for the two}} satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4MHz carrier signals at once to achieve signal diversity. This {{is in contrast to}} XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables the receiver to maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction,</b> helps keep the audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing line-of-sight of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.|$|E
25|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} demultiplexer. At {{the remote}} site, the terminal de-multiplexer consisting of an optical de-multiplexer {{and one or}} more wavelength-converting transponders separates the multi-wavelength optical signal back into individual data signals and outputs them on separate fibers for client-layer systems (such as SONET/SDH). Originally, this de-multiplexing was performed entirely passively, except for some telemetry, as most SONET systems can receive 1,550nm signals. However, {{in order to allow}} for transmission to remote client-layer systems (and to allow for digital domain signal integrity determination) such de-multiplexed signals are usually sent to O/E/O output transponders prior to being relayed to their client-layer systems. Often, the functionality of output transponder has been integrated into that of input transponder, so that most commercial systems have transponders that support bi-directional interfaces on both their 1,550nm (i.e., internal) side, and external (i.e., client-facing) side. Transponders in some systems supporting 40GHz nominal operation may also perform <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> (FEC) via digital wrapper technology, as described in the ITU-T G.709 standard.|$|E

40|$|Modern mobile {{devices are}} multi-homed with WLAN and WWAN {{communication}} interfaces. In {{a community of}} nodes with such multihomed devices — locally inter-connected via high-speed WLAN but each globally connected to larger networks via low-speed WWAN, striping high-volume traffic from remote large networks over a bundle of low speed WWAN links can overcome the bandwidth mismatch problem between WLAN and WWAN. In our previous work, we showed that a packet striping system for such multi-homed devices — a mapping of delay-sensitive packets by an intermediate gateway to multiple channels using combination of retransmissions (ARQ) and <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>corrections</b> (FEC) — can dramatically enhance the overall performance. In this paper, we improve upon a previous algorithm in two respects. First, by introducing two-tier dynamic programming tables to memoize computed solutions, packet striping decisions translate to simple table lookup operations given stationary network statistics. Doing so drastically reduces striping operation complexity. Second, new weighting functions are introduced into the hybrid ARQ/FEC algorithm to drive the long-term striping system evolution away from pathological local minima that are far from the global optimum. Results show the new algorithm performs efficiently and gives improved performance by avoiding local minima compared to the previous algorithm. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E

This approach is an extension of a corrective algorithm introduced by Dupont & Liu (2003, 2007).
