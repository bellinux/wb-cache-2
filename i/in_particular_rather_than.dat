2500|$|In 2013, {{the issue}} of Academic Boycotts and the BDS {{campaign}} received significant press treatment when a suit was filed against professor Jake Lynch, {{the director of the}} Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, by Shurat HaDin, a pro-Israel legal lobby organization. The 30 page suit focusses on Professor Lynch's denying sponsorship to professor Dan Avnon of Hebrew University because of his center's pro-BDS policy not to support institutions with ties to the Israeli military and the ongoing occupation of the West Bank. Mr Andrew Hamilton of Shurat HaDin stated [...] "Our strategic aim in this case is to address the unlawful racial discrimination of the BDS movement generally and the academic boycott <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> to narrowly focus on the discrimination against Prof. Avnon." [...] The case {{has been described as a}} [...] "landmark legal suit" [...] and [...] "a major test of the legality of the boycott, divestments and sanctions (BDS) campaign".|$|E
2500|$|Methylacetylene-propadiene (MAPP) gas and LPG gas {{are similar}} fuels, because LPG gas is {{liquefied}} petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a heat value {{a little less than}} acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures— above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume oxy-fuel cutting torches which can cut up to [...] steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe shipping and handling. MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> welding applications.|$|E

40|$|This article pushes for the {{possibility}} of alternative ways of thinking about the concept of interculturality depending on where and by whom it is being articulated (the geopolitics and body politic of knowledge). To illustrate this, the focus is shifted away from the policies of the European Union and UNESCO to the Andean region of Latin America where the notion of interculturalidad is not only a subject on the educational agenda but has also become a core component of indigenous social movements’ demands for decolonization. Part of the argument of this article is that interculturalidad, with its roots in the historical experience of colonialism and <b>in</b> the <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> assertions of universality, offers a perspective on interculturality that relies on other epistemologies.

40|$|Legislative supremacy, {{parliamentary}} accountability, and {{parliamentary privilege}} are {{the cornerstones of}} the lex et consuetudo parliamenti (law and custom of Parliament) in the United Kingdom. This article systematically examines, {{from the standpoint of}} comparative constitutional law, how a variant of this mainstay of British constitutionalism continues to thrive in the law books and case law of Hong Kong, notwithstanding the resumption of sovereignty by the People’s Republic of China. It shows how parliamentary law in general and the doctrine of legislative supremacy <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> reinforce, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> defeat, the pre-eminence of the Chief Executive in Council within the legislative process. Incidentally, it reveals that the full potential of Hong Kong’s British-descended lex et consuetudo parliamenti in promoting effective lawmaking remains largely untapped in spite of the persistent gridlocks and tensions between the Legislative Council and the government since 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
60|$|The Commissioner laid {{this letter}} aside with a sigh. Many, many such letters he had received. He {{had never been}} hurt by them, nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him personally. He was but the state's servant, and must follow its laws. And yet, somehow, this {{reflection}} did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him. Of all the state's officers he was supremest in his department, not even excepting the Governor. Broad, general land laws he followed, it was true, {{but he had a}} wide latitude <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> ramifications. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> law, what he followed was Rulings: Office Rulings and precedents.

That required in turn organizing the steel industry, which had defeated union organizing drives in 1892 and 1919 and which had resisted all organizing efforts since then fiercely. The task of organizing steelworkers, on the other hand, put Lewis {{at odds with the}} AFL, which looked down on both industrial workers and the industrial unions that represented all workers <b>in</b> a <b>particular</b> industry, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> just those <b>in</b> a <b>particular</b> skilled trade or craft.|$|R
50|$|It {{is clear}} that “Palms of Victory” had to be written by someone <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> having been the {{development}} of a community of folk singers, because it is a sophisticated song with complex verses that tell a consistent story. Jackson notes that spiritual folk songs arising from a community feature a “progressive simplification of the text.” The song is clearly based on the story of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, a book that was widely read in the 19th Century, and that had a profound influence on the Christian world-view among all denominations.|$|E
50|$|The {{indigenous}} Australians, {{far from}} being a primitive people, have a highly sophisticated society and worldview which, in Turner's view, is in many ways more advanced than those of modern Western civilization. According to Turner, the Aborigines have developed several social mechanisms for ensuring social and environmental harmony that run contrary to conventional Western thinking. <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> formulate their society around notions of personal or national autonomy and property, they favour a philosophy of mutual dependence. It is this mutual dependence, or interdependence, which ensures peaceful coexistence.|$|E

The class requires that Q “lives on a cone ” to both sides; it includes simple, closed quasigeodesics.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the concept of a net, first {{introduced}} by E. H. Moore and H. L. Smith in 1922, is to generalize the notion of a sequence so as to confirm the equivalence of the conditions (with [...] "sequence" [...] being replaced by [...] "net" [...] in condition 2). <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> being defined on a countable linearly ordered set, a net is defined on an arbitrary directed set. In particular, this allows theorems similar to that asserting the equivalence of condition 1 and condition 2, to hold in the context of topological spaces that do not necessarily have a countable or linearly ordered neighbourhood basis around a point. Therefore, while sequences do not encode sufficient information about functions between topological spaces, nets do because collections of open sets in topological spaces are much like directed sets in behaviour. The term [...] "net" [...] was coined by Kelley.|$|E

40|$|Semantic {{maps are}} usually assumed to {{describe}} a universal arrangement of different conceptual situations in a speaker's mind as determined by perceived relations of similarity between these conceptual situations. This paper provides a number of arguments that challenge this view, based on various types of evidence from processes of semantic change and synchronic implicational universals. The multifunctionality patterns described by semantic maps may originate from processes of form-function recombination <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> contexts <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> any perceived similarity between individual conceptual components. These patterns may also originate {{from the fact that}} a particular functional principle leads to the association of a particular construction type with different conceptual situations, independently of any specific relation between these conceptual situations as such. A number of synchronic and diachronic phenomena pertaining to the very structure of individual semantic maps further reveal that, even if one assumes that these provide a representation of similarity relations between different conceptual situations, they do so only to a limited extent...|$|R
50|$|Anna Sandström {{belonged to}} the circle around {{the founders of the}} women's rights {{movement}} Fredrika Bremer-förbundet of Sophie Adlersparre in 1884, in whose paper she published her first article as a reformer. During the 1890s, she was a known participator in the gender debate through her articles in the paper of Fredrika Bremer-förbundet. She represented the then radical line of the feminist movement which saw men and women as unique individuals and defended their right to develop their personalities in opposition of traditional gender roles: she opposed the Difference feminism represented by Ellen Key which demanded equal rights for men and women because their differences would complement and benefit society, and instead demanded equal rights from the viewpoint that men and women were born equal and naturally different only as individuals rather than as men and women, and that it was a waste of human resources to create psychological differences through artificial gender roles instead of helping individuals develop their personal talents and ambitions. As such, she became one of the leading figures within Swedish feminism. Her articles were also printed and sold separately. In her 1898 article Under hvilka förutsättningar kan kvinnorörelsen blifva af verklig betydelse för kultur och framåtskridande? (In which circumstances could the women's movement be of true importance for culture and progress?), in which she stated that equality between the sexes was not only necessary for the personal progress of every individual; it was also necessary to make happy marriages possible and develop a rich society.
