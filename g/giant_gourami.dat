The deduced amino acid sequence contained 17 arginine-glycine or arginine-glycine-glycine motifs and eight conserved motifs belonging to the DEAD-box protein family. The GgVLG sequence showed high similarity to Drosophila vasa, common carp vasa homolog and tilapia vasa homolog for 66. 2, 85. 9, and 90. 7 %, respectively.

Juvenile at seventh-day-old after egg yolk absorbed was immersed for 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 hours in rGH solution. As controls, fish was immersed in freshwater without rGH (control 1 : C 1), and water containing 0. 9 % NaCl, and 120 mg/L rGH (control 2 : C 2).

Fish were kept in 7 L aquaria during the first four weeks, transferred into 50 L aquaria for two weeks, and then in hapa (2 × 1 × 1 m 3 in size) for two weeks. The results showed that the highest (p< 0. 05) average body weight of <b>giant</b> <b>gourami</b> juvenile (2. 23 ± 0. 19 g) was obtained at four times (four weeks) immersion treatment. Similar body weight of fish in two times (1. 72 ± 0. 29 g), three times (1. 68 ± 0. 34 g), and five times (1. 81 ± 0. 17 g) immersion was obtained.

Ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfate were used at application rates of 9 kg N plus 4. 5 kg P 2 O 5 ha - 1 (N:P 2 O 5 = 2 : 1) as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus. Fish of an average weight of 2. 2 ± 0. 1 g were stocked at 1 fish/m 2. After the 120 day trial was finished, the results showed that the survival rate was not significantly different (p > 0. 05) but final weights, growth rates and net productions were significantly different (p 0. 05) and were in the range for optimal growth of fish. In addition, the result from regression analysis showed that fertilizer application intervals gave a high positive correlation with fish productions (r = 0. 76, p < 0. 01).

Each treatment group of gourami was paired with a control group that received feed of the same protein level, but without rGH supplementation. Juvenile of <b>giant</b> <b>gourami</b> (weight 15. 83 ± 0. 13 g) were fed diets containing rGH, to apparent satiation, 2 times a week. Fish were reared from less than 2 months old for 42 days in 100 L glass aquaria at an initial density of 10 fish per aquarium. At the end of this period, the biomass and daily growth rate (SGR) of the fish were measured and the feed conversion ratio calculated and compared. Our data showed that fish fed rGH-supplemented diets experienced higher growth than fish in the control groups and showed that fish with higher protein diets experienced higher growth than the groups with less protein diets. The group with the highest biomass gain, SGR, and lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) was the group fed a 34 % protein diet supplemented with rGH. Furthermore, biomass gain, SGR, and FCR in the rGH treatment group with a 28 % protein diet matched the measurements of the non-rGH control group receiving a 34 % protein diet (P > 0. 05).

Partial sequences of cytochrome b gene were sequenced for 40 individuals. Taxonomic status was checked for <b>giant</b> <b>gourami</b> sequences available in GenBank. Kimura 2 -Parameter genetic distances were calculated in MEGA 6 software. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity within population and Φ st -value among populations were estimated in Arlequin software. Phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 6 software based on Kimura 2 -parameter model with 1000 pseudobootstraps. Taxonomic identification results in 99 % sequences homology to Osphronemus goramy sequences (accession number KU 984978. 1 and AY 763768. 1), means that all strains belong to single species. Low genetic distances, medium haplotype and low-level nucleotide diversity were observed among strains.
