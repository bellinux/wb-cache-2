40|$|Abstract: The {{essential}} oil of mint species {{are widely used}} in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, growing throughout the world. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to know the chemical characteristics of the fresh and dried oil for economic use and enhanced performance of the end products. This study was carried out to determine mineral content, {{essential oil}} chemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of essential oil of Jordanian fresh and dried cultivated mint species (Mentha longifolia) It is found that the mint oil is a greenish yellow with acid value of 0. 83, relative density of 0. 912, and a refractive index of 1. 451. The effect of the microwave drying method on the content of volatile compounds was estimated. HPLC analysis of the essential oil identified 20 and 16 compounds of the oil from fresh and dried, respectively. It was determined that essential oil of Mentha longifolia contains pulegone and isomenthone as major components, in both <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>mint</b> <b>leaves.</b> Treatment of the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aurous. Antioxidant activities of the oils were the same for both dry and fresh M. longifolia against DPPH (IC 50 = 9 and 10 μg/ml, respectively) and 2 -fold and 4 -fold higher than shoot extracts (IC 50 = 20 and 48 μg/ml, respectively). Moreover. In the same way, the capacity to inhibit superoxide anion was very significant for the two oils (0. 1 μg/ml for M. longifolia). The antioxidant activity of essential oil of mint species lowered DPPH activity compared to ascorbic acid...|$|R
