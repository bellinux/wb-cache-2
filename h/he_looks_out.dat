25|$|When Carter {{arrives at}} Inganok, he {{purchases}} a yak and heads northward, {{in the hope}} that past the onyx quarries he will find Kadath. Carter ascends a steep ridge beyond which nothing is visible but sky. At the summit, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> and gets a breathtaking view of a gargantuan quarry. Carter sets off toward this quarry, but his yak, spooked, abandons him.|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E
500|$|Blood Omen 2 pursues {{a younger}} Kain during his early conquests of Nosgoth, in the altered {{timeline}} {{triggered by the}} changes to Raziel's destiny {{at the end of}} Soul Reaver 2. Legacy of Kain: Defiance takes place in the same altered timeline, periodically switching between the characters of the elder Kain and Raziel from Soul Reaver 2, with both acting as playable protagonists. Over the course of the game, Moebius manipulates Kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy Raziel, culminating in a final battle between the two characters which Raziel wins. It is discovered that The Elder God is malevolent, and he and Moebius—his servant—had conspired against Kain from the outset of the series, considering vampires an abomination. Kain, after being presumed dead, returns, and reconciles with Raziel, who willingly enters the Soul Reaver. As he does so, he uses his powers to cleanse Kain of the corruption he inherited at birth as a Pillar guardian. Armed with the ancient sword once again, Kain is able to see and battle The Elder God for the first time, but is unable to destroy him. The story ends as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> at the Nosgoth landscape; though uncertain that he can ever restore the world, he contemplates Raziel's sacrifice and the [...] "first bitter taste" [...] of hope it has given him.|$|E

2500|$|In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) {{reads the}} story to his {{extended}} family, but changes the narrative when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> the window and sees Cousin Eddie and Eddie's kidnapped hostage (Clark's boss) approaching the house. Instead of describing the [...] "miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer", Clark describes the strange event taking place in his front yard.|$|E
2500|$|Gibbs {{moved to}} Florida in 1867 {{where he started}} a private school in Jacksonville. He rapidly shifted from missionary work to {{political}} involvement in Reconstruction Florida. Religion and politics went hand-in-hand for black officeholders in this period. Another prominent black officeholder, Charles H. Pearce, remarked that, [...] "A man in this State, cannot do his whole duty as a minister except <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for the political interests of his people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{little dog}} symbolizes loyalty, {{or can be}} seen as an emblem of lust, {{signifying}} the couple's desire to have a child. Unlike the couple, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> to meet the gaze of the viewer. [...] The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. So, the dog could reflect the wealth of the couple and their position in courtly life.|$|E
2500|$|Blacks in the South were a core {{element of}} the Republican Party and their ministers had {{powerful}} political roles that were distinctive since they did not depend on white support, in contrast to teachers, politicians, businessmen, and tenant farmers. Acting on the principle as stated by Charles H. Pearce, an AME minister in Florida: [...] "A man in this State cannot do his whole duty as a minister except <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for the political interests of his people," [...] over 100 black ministers were elected to state legislatures during Reconstruction, {{as well as several}} to Congress and one, Hiram Revels, to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> heard a faint cry. He {{listened intently}} {{and soon the}} cry was repeated.|$|R

6000|$|Jonas did so, and {{was almost}} at his ease. 'Pecksniff,' he whispered, as they drew their chairs about the table; 'I gave him {{as good as}} he brought, eh? He had better look at home, before <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of window, I think?' ...|$|E
60|$|CAMPBELL (looking round). We {{appear to}} have fallen in with a party of dry-goods drummers. It makes a gentleman feel like an intruder. [The train stops; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of the window.] We've arrived. Come, Agnes; come, Roberts; come, Mr. Sawyer--let's be going.|$|E
60|$|They {{were both}} silent. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the window, and could faintly discern {{the snow on}} the garden.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> down at Frona. She was {{steadying}} the box, and {{her face}} was composed. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over the crowd and saw unbelief. Many were laughing.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tom knitted {{his brows}} a little, then he smiled, and then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over the flower-beds without saying anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the remotest idea," [...] said Johnny. [...] "He {{is a man}} about my own age, very good-looking, and {{apparently}} very well {{able to take care}} of himself. He is short-sighted, and holds a glass in one eye when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of a carriage-window. That's all that I know about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 15. The startling bell-tower Giotto raised. Giotto {{began the}} Campanile in 1334, {{and after his}} death in 1337 the work was {{continued}} by Andrea Pisano. Its striking beauty impresses the poet as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> over the city. But it does more than that, for it rouses in him reflections on the progress and meaning of art.|$|E
6000|$|Yet Theophilus {{is without}} guile or malice. His want {{of faith in}} human nature is not bitter and censorious, but melting and pitiful. [...] "We are all poor trash, miserable dogs together," [...] he seems to say, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> on {{the world and its}} ways. There is not much to be {{expected}} of or for any of us; but let us love one another and be patient.|$|E

60|$|SERGIUS (shivering as if {{a bullet}} had struck him, and {{speaking}} with quiet but deep indignation). I will prove that that, at least, is a calumny. (He goes with dignity {{to the door}} and opens it. A yell of fury bursts from him as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out.</b> He darts into the passage, and returns dragging in Louka, whom he flings against the table, R., as he cries) Judge her, Bluntschli--you, the moderate, cautious man: judge the eavesdropper.|$|E
60|$|Never {{while the}} brave Courier lives! Behold him {{jingling}} out of Piacenza, and staggering this way, in the tallest posting-chaise ever seen, so that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> {{of the front}} window {{as if he were}} peeping over a garden wall; while the postilion, concentrated essence of all the shabbiness of Italy, pauses for a moment in his animated conversation, to touch his hat to a blunt-nosed little Virgin, hardly less shabby than himself, enshrined in a plaster Punch's show outside the town.|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} {{can do nothing}} but go in search of him. Sir Leicester, with such power of {{movement}} as he has, arranges himself a little to receive him. When he has done so, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps. A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there, and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels.|$|E
