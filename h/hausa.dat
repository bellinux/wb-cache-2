5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by {{a small minority of}} the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. <b>Hausa</b> is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, <b>Hausa</b> and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra's {{history is}} known through stories passed down over centuries, {{making it hard}} to {{separate}} fact and fiction. Most accounts agree about her birth to Shama the courtesan and her death in the Vithoba temple when the Badshah of Bidar sought her. However, the characters of Sadashiva Malagujar (her alleged father) and <b>Hausa</b> the maid do not appear in all accounts.|$|E
5|$|The Nok {{civilisation}} of Northern Nigeria flourished between 500 BC and AD 200, producing life-sized terracotta {{figures that}} {{are some of}} the earliest known sculptures in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further north, the cities Kano and Katsina have a recorded history dating to around 999 AD. <b>Hausa</b> kingdoms and the Kanem-Bornu Empire prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa.|$|E
5|$|The major {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Nigeria represent three major families of languages of Africa: {{the majority are}} Niger-Congo languages, such as Igbo, Yoruba and Fulfulde; Kanuri, spoken in the northeast, primarily in Borno and Yobe State, {{is part of the}} Nilo-Saharan family; and <b>Hausa</b> is an Afroasiatic language.|$|E
5|$|Africa {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of {{language}} families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population. A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and <b>Hausa.</b>|$|E
5|$|IPA letters {{have been}} {{incorporated}} into the alphabets of various languages, notably via the Africa Alphabet in many sub-Saharan languages such as <b>Hausa,</b> Fula, Akan, Gbe languages, Manding languages, Lingala, etc. This has created the need for capital variants. For example, Kabiyè of northern Togo has Ɖ ɖ, Ŋ ŋ, Ɣ ɣ, Ɔ ɔ, Ɛ ɛ, Ʋ ʋ. These, and others, are supported by Unicode, but appear in Latin ranges other than the IPA extensions.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria {{has more}} than 500 ethnic groups, with varying {{languages}} and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the <b>Hausa,</b> Yoruba, Igbo and Fulani, together accounting for more than 70% of the population, while the Urhobo-Isoko, Edo, Ijaw, Kanuri, Ibibio, Ebira, Nupe, Gwari, Jukun, Igala, Idoma and Tiv comprise between 25 and 30%; other minorities make up the remaining 5%.|$|E
5|$|Sadashiva Malagujar, Kanhopatra's {{supposed}} father, {{heard of}} Kanhopatra's beauty and wished {{to see her}} dance, but Kanhopatra refused. Accordingly, Sadashiva started to harass Kanhopatra and Shama. Shama tried {{to convince him that}} he was the father of Kanhopatra and thus should spare them, but Sadashiva did not believe her. As he continued his harassment, Shama's wealth slowly depleted. Eventually, Shama apologised to Sadashiva and offered to present Kanhopatra to him. Kanhopatra, however, fled to Pandharpur disguised as a maid, {{with the help of her}} aged maid <b>Hausa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (<b>Hausa,</b> Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} Nigeria's major ethnic groups, the <b>Hausa</b> ethnic group (predominant in the north) {{was found to}} be 95% Muslim and 5% Christian, the Yoruba tribe (predominant in the west) was 55% Muslim, 35% Christian and 10% adherents of other religions, while the Igbos (predominant in the east) and the Ijaw (south) were 98% Christian, with 2% practising {{traditional}} religions. The middle belt of Nigeria contains the largest number of minority ethnic groups in Nigeria, who were found to be mostly Christians and members of traditional religions, with a small proportion of Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} people of Enugu include the Ogui Nike {{who live in}} the areas surrounding Hotel Presidential, Obiagu, Ama-Igbo, Ihewuzi and Onu-Asata. Other groups include the Awkunanaw people, who live mainly in the Achara Layout and Uwani areas. The Enugwu Ngwo people live in Hilltop on the west of the city with their farm lands sprawling all over the valley. Other Nike people live around the Abakpa, Iji-Nike, and Emene areas of the city. Most of the non-{{indigenous people}} of Enugu are migrants {{from other parts of the}} Igbo cultural area. After the majority Igbo, the Yoruba people are another significant ethnic group found present in Enugu; other groups include the <b>Hausa,</b> Kanuri, Ijaw, and Fulani people.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} Saharan tribes, Berber {{in origin}} and later adapting to Muslim and Arab cultures, controlled the channels to western Africa by making {{efficient use of}} horse-drawn vehicles and pack animals. The Songhai engaged in a struggle against the Sa'di dynasty of Morocco over {{the control of the}} trans Saharan trade, resulting in damage on both sides and a weak Moroccan victory, further strengthening the uninvolved Saharan tribes. Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century, by which the Mandé merchants were trading with the <b>Hausa,</b> between Lake Chad and the Niger. Newer trade routes developed following extension of trade.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. <b>Hausa</b> Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Mmrafo ani ase, the keloids on a <b>Hausa</b> man.|$|E
25|$|Torodbe clerics {{included}} {{people whose}} origin was Fula, Wolof, Mande, <b>Hausa</b> and Berber.|$|E

25|$|The antiquity of the <b>Hausa</b> origins {{account is}} {{believed}} to be attested by the role which water plays in the story. In the ancient world shrines were built along rivers and at wells or springs from West Central Africa to the Indus River Valley. Serpents inhabited these places and were both venerated and feared. In Sanskrit serpent is naaga, in Hebrew nahash, and in <b>Hausa</b> the serpent is naja.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of views on the Bayajidda story, with differing {{opinions}} on the meaning and historicity of the tale. Some scholars suppose that Bayajidda is an historical person, the founder of the Seven <b>Hausa</b> states, and contemporary <b>Hausa</b> royals - especially those in Daura and Zaria (Zazzau) - trace their lineage to and draw their authority from him (see Kano Chronicle). By contrast, others claim that Bayajidda never existed.|$|E
25|$|In Ewe {{and other}} Togolese {{language}}s, {{as well as}} in parts of Mali and Cameroon and in the <b>Hausa</b> language of southern Niger and northern Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|A {{strongly}} Arabic/Islamic song style, {{as found}} for example among the <b>Hausa.</b> It {{is characterized by}} melisma, wavy intonation, pitch instabilities within a pentatonic framework, and a declamatory voice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Gobir, Usman dan Fodio (1754–1817) accused the <b>Hausa</b> {{leadership}} of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt. In 1804, he launched the Fulani War as a jihad among a population that was restless about high taxes and discontented with its leaders. Jihad fever swept northern Nigeria, with strong support among both the Fulani and the <b>Hausa.</b> Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon, with Sokoto as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son Muhammed Bello. The Sokoto Caliphate lasted until 1903 when the British conquered northern Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|Within Africa, Oromo is the {{language}} with the fourth most speakers, after Arabic (if one counts the mutually unintelligible spoken forms of Arabic as a single language and assumes {{the same for the}} varieties of Oromo), Swahili, and <b>Hausa.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zarma {{language}} of the Songhay family. It is the {{language of}} the southwestern lobe of the West African nation of Niger, and it is the second leading language of Niger, after <b>Hausa,</b> which is spoken in south central Niger.|$|E
25|$|All vocal {{languages}} use pitch pragmatically in intonation—for instance for emphasis, {{to convey}} surprise or irony, or {{to pose a}} question. Tonal languages such as Chinese and <b>Hausa</b> use intonation in addition to using pitch for distinguishing words.|$|E
25|$|The lands {{within the}} Ashanti Kingdom were also rich in river-gold, cocoa and kola nuts, and the Ashanti were soon trading with the Portuguese at coastal fort Sao Jorge da Mina, later Elmina, the Songhai, {{and with the}} <b>Hausa</b> states.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{the colonial}} regimes had little {{interest}} in the writing of African languages, but in others they did. In the case of <b>Hausa</b> in Northern Nigeria, for instance, the colonial government was directly involved in determining the written forms for the language.|$|E
25|$|Talk in Gurina also {{concerned}} events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the <b>Hausa</b> leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and Kébbi. Usman had now {{turned his attention}} to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).|$|E
25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} in the diet of {{residents}} near the coast and millet {{a staple in}} the interior. Fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with cereal grains. The Portuguese encouraged peanut production. Vigna subterranea (Bambara groundnut) and Macrotyloma geocarpum (<b>Hausa</b> groundnut) are also grown. Black-eyed peas {{are also part of}} the diet. Palm oil is harvested.|$|E
25|$|Radio programs, {{designed}} {{in part to}} reach non-reading members of the public, were {{a major focus of}} the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation. In 1961, the GBC formed an external service broadcasting in English, French, Arabic, Swahili, Portuguese, and <b>Hausa.</b> Using four 100-kilowatt transmitters and two 250-kilowatt transmitters, the GBC External Service broadcast 110 hours of Pan-Africanist programming to Africa and Europe each week.|$|E
25|$|In West African cuisine, {{potassium}} nitrate (saltpetre) {{is widely used}} as a thickening agent in soups and stews such as okra soup and isi ewu. It {{is also used to}} soften food and reduce cooking time when boiling beans and tough meat. Saltpetre is also an essential ingredient in making special porridges, such as kunun kanwa literally translated from the <b>Hausa</b> language as 'saltpetre porridge'.|$|E
25|$|Islam {{is practiced}} in the city by people from Northern and Western Nigeria. In February 2006, armed militants killed at least 24 ethnic <b>Hausa</b> Fulani (Muslims) and burned a few Muslim sites, {{including}} two mosques. The riots were in response to riots by Muslims {{in the city of}} Maiduguri days earlier, where at least 18 Christians were killed, sparked by the cartoon controversy in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The Dagomba speak Dagbani {{language}} (Dagbane). The Dagomba {{reside in}} Dagbon (Northern Ghana). For centuries, the area inhabited by Dagomba peoples {{has been the}} scene of movements of people engaged in conquest, expansion, and north-south and east-west trade. Many terms from Arabic, <b>Hausa</b> and Dyula are seen in the Dagbani language, due {{to the importance of}} trans-saharan trade and West African trade and the historic impact that the Islamic religion has had in the area.|$|E
25|$|At first Wadai {{paid tribute}} to Bornu and Durfur, but by the 18th century Wadai was fully {{independent}} and had become an aggressor against its neighbors.To the west of Bornu, by the 15th century the Kingdom of Kano had become {{the most powerful of}} the <b>Hausa</b> Kingdoms, in an unstable truce with the Kingdom of Katsina to the north. Both were absorbed into the Sokoto Caliphate during the Fulani Jihad of 1805, which threatened Bornu itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Nigeria became {{independent}} of the United Kingdom. As with many other new African states, {{the borders of the}} country did not reflect earlier ethnic, cultural or religious boundaries. Thus, the northern region of the country has a Muslim majority, while the southern population is predominantly Christian. Following independence, Nigeria was divided primarily along ethnic lines with a <b>Hausa</b> and Fulani majority in the north, and Yoruba and Igbo majorities in the south-west and south-east respectively.|$|E
25|$|Roughly 250 {{years after}} Leo Africanus' visit to Timbuktu, {{the city had}} seen many rulers. The end of the 18th century saw {{the grip of the}} Moroccan rulers on the city wane, {{resulting}} in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes. During the rule of one of those tribes, the <b>Hausa,</b> a 14-year-old child from Tetouan accompanied his father on a visit to Timbuktu. Growing up a merchant, he was captured and eventually brought to England.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of January, MNJ rebels claimed they had been joined by ethnic Toubou rebel leaders and several <b>Hausa</b> army officers. While there was no independent confirmation of this, the Toubou Forces armées révolutionnaires du Sahara (FARS) had risen against {{the government in the}} 1990s (see Tuareg Rebellion) in the far southeast of Niger. The MNJ claimed the former FARS commander Bocar Mohamed Sougouma, (alias Warabé) had ordered former rebels to rally to the MNJ-controlled Tamgak Plateau near Iferaouane.|$|E
