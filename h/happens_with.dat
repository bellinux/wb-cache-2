25|$|Again, this <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> {{electrons}} {{before it}} <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167nm, which was {{long enough to}} exhibit a single diffraction side lobe when reflecting {{from the face of}} a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215nm. With a larger vacuum chamber, it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular resolution from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, dysarthria, another motor speech disorder, is {{characterized}} by difficulty articulating sounds.

25|$|Aromatic {{molecules}} typically display enhanced chemical stability, {{compared to}} similar non-aromatic molecules. A molecule {{that can be}} aromatic will tend to change toward aromaticity, and the added stability changes the chemistry of the molecule.

25|$|Sodium thiopental or pentobarbital: ultrashort-action barbiturate, an {{anesthetic}} agent used at a {{high dose}} that renders the person unconscious in less than 30 seconds.

25|$|Most Japanese {{interaction}} with Russian individuals – besides {{in major cities}} such as Tokyo – <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> seamen and fishermen of the Russian fishing fleet, therefore Japanese people tend to carry the stereotypes associated with sailors over to Russians.

25|$|Competition {{for water}} has widely increased, {{and it has}} become more {{difficult}} to conciliate the necessities for water supply for human consumption, food production, ecosystems and other uses. Water administration is frequently involved in contradictory and complex problems. Approximately 10% of the worldwide annual runoff is used for human necessities. Several areas of the world are flooded, while others have such low precipitations that human life is almost impossible. As population and development increase, raising water demand, the possibility of problems inside a certain country or region increases, as it <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> others outside the region.|$|E

25|$|Example 5. Periodic {{sequence}}. A {{sequence is}} called periodic when there exists some number n > 0, called {{a witness to}} periodicity, such that x'i= x'i+n for all i ≥ 0. The period of a periodic sequence is its least witness. Negation leaves period unchanged, while the disjunction of two periodic sequences is periodic, with period at most the least common multiple of the periods of the two arguments (the period can be as small as 1, as <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> the union of any sequence and its complement). Hence the periodic sequences form a Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|The initial split {{was between}} the New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) and all other passerines, and the second split {{involved}} the Tyranni (suboscines) and the Passeri (oscines or songbirds). The later experienced a great radiation of forms out of the Australian continent. A major branch of the Passeri, parvorder Passerida, expanded deep into Eurasia and Africa, where a further explosive radiation of new lineages occurred. This eventually led to three major Passerida lineages comprising about 4,000 species, which {{in addition to the}} Corivida and numerous minor lineages make up songbird diversity today. Extensive biogeographical mixing <b>happens,</b> <b>with</b> northern forms returning to the south, southern forms moving north, and so on.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is similar to}} what <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> the green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior {{have been found in}} hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E
