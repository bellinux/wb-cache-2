Glover said: We {{not only have}} great respect for each other as athletes but we are great friends on and off the water. I can genuinely say I want to win these races as much for Heather as for myself. We know how much we put into every session – it isn’t <b>just</b> <b>our</b> day job, it’s our passion.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not <b>just</b> <b>our</b> bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

Carl Smith from SugarScape described the track as [...] "SASS CENTRAL", ending his review with [...] "it's generally <b>just</b> <b>our</b> new office jam".

It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was <b>just</b> <b>our</b> approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if you ask me, is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage.
