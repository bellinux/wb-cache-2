5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 1799, a French {{squadron}} had sailed from Rochefort. Consisting of the frigates Concorde, under Commodore Jean-François Landolphe, Médée, under Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin, and Franchise, under Captain Pierre Jurien, it was {{a powerful}} force, capable of inflicting significant damage on lightly defended merchant shipping. Eluding the blockade force off Rochefort, the squadron sailed southwards until it reached the coast of West Africa. There Landolphe's ships began an extended commerce raiding operation, inflicting severe damage on the West African trade {{during the rest of}} the year. Eventually the strain of serving in tropical waters told on the ships and all three were forced to undergo an extensive refit in the nearest available allied shipyards, which were located in the Spanish-held River Plate in South America. Repairs continued for six months, until Landolphe considered the squadron once again ready to sail in the early summer of 1800. The squadron almost immediately captured an American schooner, which <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> out as a tender. At the time, France and the United States had been engaged for two years in the Quasi War.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 2005, {{the crew}} began {{shooting}} at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected {{as he felt}} <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> the sense of remoteness he was looking for. However, this was also a problem; the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production, as while the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.|$|E

While <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> {{the request of the}} Infantry for light, easy to manhandle {{anti-tank}} weapon, Artillery and Ordnance foresaw a need for a more powerful gun. This led to a number of expedient designs, such as adaptations of the 75 mm M1897 or towed variants of the 75 mm M3.|$|E

His {{tremendous}} memory about people and their lives helped him to build up his networks in the Christian Democratic Union, in government and abroad. In a study of German chancellorship as political leadership, Henrik Gast gives examples how much time Kohl invested into personal relationships even with the backbenchers in the Bundestag and also party officials up to the local level. This worked, because <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> Kohl's character and was authentic.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} 1864, {{there was}} a {{financial}} crisis, firms crashed and hundreds of shops closed down. Robinson managed to survive {{during this period of}} time. A new shop was opened at Battery Road, and the company's first assistant was appointed from England, T. C. Loveridge, which took charge of a newly opened tailoring department. Loveridge took lessons in Singapore from an experienced cutter and first tried out his skill by cutting out a frockcoat for a colleague. <b>It</b> <b>fitted</b> well and the latter became a partner in the business. Robinson offered to sell out for £1,000 (which was a huge sum of money then), but Loveridge rejected the offer.|$|E
25|$|Planck {{sent this}} result to Rubens, who {{compared}} {{it with his}} and Kurlbaum's observational data and found that <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data, and Planck added a short presentation to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula. Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that {{made it all the}} way through the process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.|$|E
25|$|Metz was an {{important}} cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions {{to the body of}} chant: <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also {{an important}} centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.|$|E

25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of compact design, <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical fin with an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side torque reaction from the Daimler-Benz engine's counterclockwise rotation. Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right swing on takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E
500|$|... "Night Terrors" [...] was {{inspired}} by Gatiss's fear of dolls, and {{the ones in the}} episode were designed to be scary and crude-looking. The episode was moved from {{the first half of the}} series to the second, which necessitated changes to make it fit into the series' story arc. It was the first to be filmed, with production taking place in September 2010 at a council estate in Redcliffe, Bristol and at Dyrham Park, where the doll's house interior scenes were filmed. The episode was watched by 7.07 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics, though some were critical of how <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> into the overarching story as it came after a heavy story-arc episode.|$|E

Franks was asked to return again later in 2008 but could not make it, so Franks thought Rainie would not be seen again. She returned for the longer stint in 2010, starting on 3August. Franks {{did not expect to}} be asked to return in 2010, and said the call came as a surprise. She said it was [...] "ideal" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time. She commented that Rainie would be [...] "unlikely to return without stirring up a bit of trouble". Rainie returned again on 12April2011 as a regular character, for Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop, along with Tanya and Rainie's mother Cora, where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters.|$|E
500|$|The promotional album Wipeout: The Music was {{released}} on CD and vinyl in 1996, and features the aforementioned three tracks by Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, as well as additional tracks by New Order and The Prodigy. Burcombe explained that the choice of genres {{was based on an}} experience he had while playing Super Mario Kart: he had just finished in first place but had [...] "Age of Love" [...] playing instead of the game's soundtrack, and thought <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> the moment. Persuading record companies to get involved with the promotional album proved difficult as they did not understand what the development team wanted. Notable, however, is the omission of tracks by CoLD SToRAGE. This surprised some, as Wright's contributions were popular with players, and the omission of his songs in favor of more established acts seemed an affront to video game music as a burgeoning art form.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, calling it [...] "maybe the best hour of television Millennium ever produced". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode's [...] "disarmingly simple" [...] premise belied its depth, and praised Morgan's script as perhaps the writer's best work. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a very fun, very irreverent respite for the series". Gibron felt positively about the episode's dialogue and humor, and praised it for its self-parodying elements. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me" [...] two stars out of five, finding that <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> poorly with {{the tone of the}} series. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "self-indulgent and irrelevant at worst, and at best only sporadically funny".|$|E

A track that went through multiple redrafts was [...] "Aurum Island", the theme associated with the titular alien invaders: while every attempt made to create a theme ended up as a [...] "techno-pop song", the tune underwent multiple adjustments so it would not clash {{with the rest of the}} soundtrack while retaining its form. [...] "Lightning Chariot Base", due to the size of the level, was designed so players would notice its presence without growing tired of it. [...] "Practice Arena", the tune for the pre-multiplayer training area, was designed by Takada to have a light, analogue feel; it was originally composed for a different unspecified area, but it was decided that <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> well with the build-up to a multiplayer match.|$|E
500|$|During development, Shimomura {{discussed}} {{her music}} with the game's other developers so <b>it</b> <b>fitted</b> the game's world, along with reading the story. Many {{of the tracks}} began as requests from the writers, and for some songs {{there was a lot}} of consultation with staff including director Hajime Tabata while they were being written. Several tracks were meant to emote specific moods. For [...] "Luna", the theme for the character Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Shimomura used the character's beauty and strength as inspiration; for the titular theme of main protagonist Noctis Lucis Caelum, she chose to represent the weight of destiny upon him and his inner thoughts, creating a soft piece that portrayed his emotions. The theme [...] "Apocalypsis Noctis" [...] was intended to be both magnificent and intense, while the track [...] "Melancolia" [...] was meant to evoke sadness. The music had to include tracks for various times of day due to the game's day-night cycle. Uematsu's [...] "Main Theme", a recurring theme within the Final Fantasy series, also appeared in an arranged form created by Shimomura and Nakama. Another recurring theme in the series, Uematsu's [...] "Chocobo" [...] theme, was remixed by Ohta for the tracks [...] "Blues de Chocobo" [...] and [...] "Rodeo de Chocobo".|$|E
