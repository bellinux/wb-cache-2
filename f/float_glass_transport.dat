25|$|<b>Float</b> <b>glass</b> is a {{sheet of}} <b>glass</b> made by <b>floating</b> molten <b>glass</b> {{on a bed of}} molten metal, {{typically}} tin, although lead and various low melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from <b>float</b> <b>glass.</b> Most <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> process. The <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, who pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.|$|R

40|$|Contact angle {{measurements}} using method {{based on}} B-spline snakes (active contours) {{were applied to}} investigate surface wettability properties of commercial soda-lime-silica <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> subjected to various surface preparation methods. The comparative evaluation of vacuum evaporated chromium thin film adhesion strength to <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> treated under different surface preparation methods was performed using scratch tests. Also, the influence of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> substrate heating for chromium thin film adhesion strength was investigated. Surface activation and contamination removal by O 2 plasma process and RCA- 1 surface preparation method revealed the best results, where surfaces were free of hydrophobic contaminants with low contact angles ranging from 4 ° to 8 °. For majority of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> surface preparation methods the contact angles were observed slightly higher for the “tin side” as compared with “air side”. Soda-lime-silica <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> surface wettability properties of both sides were equalized during bombardment in RIBE unit by Ar + ion beam. O 2 plasma process and RCA- 1 surface preparation method for <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> resulted in a higher value of the thin chromium film adhesion to the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> substrate as measured from the average critical normal force (O 2 plasma 0. 169  N; RCA- 1 0. 14  N) in scratch tests. The <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> substrate heating (100 °C) in the vacuum chamber before chromium thin film evaporation process resulted in even higher value of the thin chromium film adhesion to the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> substrate.

5000|$|General purpose {{glass is}} mostly {{made by the}} <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> process and is {{obtainable}} in thicknesses from 1.5 to 25 mm ( [...] to 1 in). Thin <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> tends to cut easily with a sharp cutter. Thicker glass such as 10 mm ( [...] in)) <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> is significantly more difficult to cut and break; glass with textured or patterned surfaces may demand specialized methods for scoring and opening the cuts.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, the {{polished}} plate process was improved by Pilkington which incorporated a double grinding process {{to give an}} improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from <b>float</b> <b>glass.</b> Most <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> were first achieved in 1960.|$|R

50|$|Annealed {{glass is}} glass without {{internal}} stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed {{if it is}} heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. <b>Float</b> <b>glass</b> is annealed {{during the process of}} manufacture. However, most toughened glass is made from <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> that has been specially heat-treated.|$|R
40|$|Having glazing on {{buildings}} {{will allow}} natural daylighting in a room. There are {{four types of}} glazing which are commonly used in the market today: Clear, light green, bronze and black <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> where tinted glazing will provide shading to the interior. These four glass are being tested using Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IESVE) software with different proportion to investigate the influence of arrangements of glazing to permit daylight and to serve as shading device. There are 40 combinations of different glazing proportion tested in the simulation. The combination of 75 % clear <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> on a green <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> base gives the highest lux value at a point 90 cm from the opening whereas the lowest value is exhibited through a 25 % green <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> with a black <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> base of 75 %.

40|$|Anti-reflection {{coatings}} {{on glass}} substrates were {{prepared by the}} application of sol-gel coatings of silica containing crystalline tin oxide particles. The sol was coated on commercially available <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> by dip-coating and spin-coating techniques. Increasing the surface roughness of the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> (factor of 50) by a particulate coating material resulted in anti-reflection effects comparable to frosted glass. Haze and clarity, which are a measure for the contrast and definition of an optical system, were determined and compared to the uncoated and the commercial frosted glass. The reflectivity of the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> could be reduced from 9 % to 3 %, which is a factor of two better than that of glasses...|$|R
50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} {{glass is}} a type of glass that has increased strength {{as a result of a}} post-production chemical process. When broken, it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to <b>float</b> <b>glass.</b> For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. However, chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of <b>float</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

40|$|Energy-Saving Glass (ESG) is used {{to prevent}} the {{penetration}} of infrared (IR) radiation into buildings and hence to maintain thermal comfort. ESG is made of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> with metallic-oxide coating over it. Unfortunately RF/microwave signals are attenuated by this coating making communication more difficult. Multi-layer <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> windows provide another solution that can offer thermal comfort inside buildings. This paper presents a parametric study on the transmission of RF/microwave signals through <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> panels. Single, double and tripple glass panels are analyzed {{and the effects of}} the dielectric constant, thickness and gap between panels are considered. It is observed that with appropriate selection of parameters high-transmission band can be changed to obtain best transmission at some frequencies while stronger transmission at the lower frequencies (e,g up to 2 GHz) or wider passband with larger passband ripples can be obtained. 4 page(s...|$|R
