40|$|The {{design of}} {{real-time}} dependable systems {{is dominated by}} the need to meet real-time deadlines. In this paper we present a methodology for analyzing durations in real-time dependable systems and <b>for</b> estimating <b>the</b> probabilities that real-time deadlines will be met. The probability density functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> composite operations are obtained by convolving the probability density functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> simpler operations. These probability density functions may be correlated, and such correlations must be handled correctly when the convolutions are performed. Example applications of the methodology are given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Totem multicast group communication protocols. Keywords: Real-time, dependable, probability density function. 1 Introduction Traditionally, real-time systems have been defined by requirements that specific events, typically input or output operations, must occur at or before precisely defined moments in time [2, 4, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 21].

5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the war {{he was unable to}} drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the hostilities.
