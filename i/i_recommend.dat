500|$|A May 1864 {{report by}} Brigadier General A.P. Howe, {{artillery}} inspector for the Union Army, found Fort Runyon to be [...] "out of repair and at present unoccupied." [...] Howe {{recommended that the}} fort be repaired and reoccupied as soon as possible. [...] "It holds ... an important position, being {{at the head of}} Long Bridge, and if occupied would hold the bridge and guard it from surprise. <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> that it be put in order and occupied." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, [...] "It's hard {{to believe}} that in 1967 we {{actually}} waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof. It was a disappointment then; it's a curio today, but just as hard to get through." [...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|E

500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you {{to say nothing of}} your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: [...] "with 'Loveless' you could've {{expected the}} Irish / English partnership {{to succumb to}} self-parody or mimic The Scene That's Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, 'Loveless' fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations." [...] While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines, he concluded [...] "'Loveless' ups the ante, and, however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, My Bloody Valentine, failings and all, deserve more than your respect." [...] Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that Loveless [...] " [...] how unique, how peerless MBV are." [...] He declared, [...] "Along with Mercury Rev's Yerself is Steam, 'Loveless' is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991." [...] Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that [...] "while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were, they've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond." [...] In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush, Rolling Stone reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "Despite the record's intense ability to disorient—this is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuff—the effect is strangely uplifting. Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had [...] "written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock`s central instrument." [...] Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album's songs are [...] "standard-ish and dull" [...] and concluded that he felt [...] "The warped music is a cool idea and <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> the album—but {{not on the basis}} of the singing or the songs".|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

[...] The robin {{is only one of the}} far greater multitude of small birds which live almost indiscriminately on grain or insects, and which <b>I</b> <b>recommended</b> you to call generally [...] "sparrows"; but of the robin itself, there are two important European varieties--one red-breasted, and the other blue-breasted.|$|R
2500|$|Ranger Dan (Ilic) {{provides}} {{the public with}} the 3rd Degree's community service announcements. He advocates bizarre initiatives such as giving homeless people violins to play sad music to distinguish themselves as genuinely homeless. Ranger Dan appeared to commit suicide in the final episode of series one, however, he returns in Series 2 to announce that ugly people would be given a guitar {{to make them more}} attractive.

2500|$|On 3 January 2012, Iran {{threatened}} {{to take action}} if the U.S. Navy moves an aircraft carrier back into the Persian Gulf. [...] Iranian Army chief Ataollah Salehi said the United States had moved an aircraft carrier out of the Gulf because of Iran's naval exercises, and Iran would take action if the ship returned. [...] "Iran will not repeat its warning...the enemy's carrier has been moved to the Gulf of Oman because of our drill.

Upon picking of the jury after listening to all of the jurors we had to pick, if we had to pick a black juror <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> that [...] be one of the jurors."

2500|$|Sean Penn has said, [...] "The {{screenplay}} is {{the most}} magnificent one that I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen. ... A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact." [...] He further clarified his reservations about the film by adding, [...] "But it's a film <b>I</b> <b>recommend,</b> {{as long as you}} go in without any preconceived ideas. It's up to each person to find their own personal, emotional or spiritual connection to it. Those that do generally emerge very moved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kushner prefers {{that the}} theatricality be transparent. In his notes about staging, he writes: [...] "The plays {{benefit from a}} pared-down style of presentation, with scenery kept to an evocative and {{informative}} minimum. [...] <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> rapid scene shifts (no blackouts!), employing the cast as well as stagehands in shifting the scene. This must be an actor-driven event. [...] The moments of magic [...] are to be fully imagined and realized, as wonderful theatrical illusions—which means it's OK if the wires show, and maybe it's good that they do..." [...] Kushner is an admirer of Brecht, who practiced a style of theatrical production whereby audiences were often reminded {{that they were in}} a theatre. The choice to have [...] "no blackouts" [...] allows audiences to participate in the construction of a malleable theatrical world.|$|E
2500|$|Carter Burwell, the {{composer}} of Twilight and , returned to score the final {{installment of the}} series. In later announcements, Burwell confirmed that the score for the film was complete. [...] "The movie basically upholds the final installment with a score that has the same jungle-music feeling [...] brought us," [...] Burwell affirmed. [...] "The music pieces {{that take place in}} the catalytic final battle will be very much like the nineteenth song in the previous movie's score, 'It's Renesmee' and the twenty-fourth, 'You Kill Her You Kill Me', which were, if not the most, one of the boldest pieces in my career. I will tease anything but <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> for the fans to listen to 'A Kick in the Head', 'Exacueret Nostri Dentes in Filia' and 'Aro's End' {{if you want to have}} goosebumps for the rest of your life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Comparing {{around a}} quarter of the size records from the first edition against shells in the {{collections}} of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases. What Rosenberg considered [...] "f greatest concern", however, were discrepancies between the record sizes listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary monographic works, and this even extended to type specimens in some cases. The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the Pleurotomariidae—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw & Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the record sizes of Terebridae. Rosenberg concluded: [...] "The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included record sizes from the literature, and <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> this be done in future editions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dynastic tradition: Among the Bonapartes this {{includes}} legal {{changes in the}} succession order during {{the first and second}} empires, and post-monarchy attempts to change heirs by testament. Napoleon I quarreled openly with some of his brothers, particularly over their marriages, and dethroned or de-dynasticized them. When Napoleon III's only son, the Prince Imperial Louis Napoléon, died in 1879, his will purported to exclude his cousin and genealogical heir, Prince Napoléon Joseph, from headship of the deposed dynasty due to political differences, in favor of his elder son, Prince Victor Napoléon. Although almost all Bonapartists therefore recognized his son, Napoléon Joseph insisted that his dynastic claim remained intact. Yet as Imperial pretender he likewise disavowed his heir, writing in his will, [...] "I leave nothing to Victor, my elder son. He is a traitor and a rebel.... <b>I</b> <b>recommend</b> to my son Louis to remain faithful to my political and religious opinions. They are in the true tradition of my uncle Napoleon I. I hope that Louis will be the representative of the cause of the Napoleons. His aim must be to organise French democracy." ...|$|E
