In short, this was the land of continuance. Old Time never took it into his head to practise either addition, or subtraction, or multiplication on its sum total.|$|E

HHP treatments reduced viable cell counts by 3. 6 log cycles. The residual surviving population did not increase during storage at 4 °C. However, bacterial counts significantly increased at 22 °C by day 3, leading to rapid spoilage. The microbiota of <b>green</b> <b>asparagus</b> was composed mainly by Proteobacteria (mainly Pantoea and Pseudomonas), followed by Firmicutes (mainly Lactococcus and Enterococcus) and {{to a less extent}} Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. During chill storage of untreated asparagus, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria as well as Enterococcus and Lactococcus decreased while Lactobacillus increased. During storage of untreated asparagus at 22 °C, the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased while Proteobacteria increased during late storage. The HHP treatment determined a reduction of the Proteobacteria both early after treatment and during chill storage. In the HHP treated samples stored at 22 °C, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas rapidly decreased at day 1, with an increase of Bacteroidetes. This was followed by a marked increase in Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia) simultaneously with increase in viable counts and spoilage. Results from the study indicate that the effect of HHP treatments on the viability of microbial populations in foods also has an impact on the dynamics of microbial populations during the storage of the treated foods. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>asparagus</b> (Asparagus officinalis L.) {{crops are}} {{frequently}} {{damaged by the}} grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum). Most damage occurs in the soil, although some asparagus spears are attacked above ground. In the Netherlands damage occurs especially during the first 5 weeks of harvesting, {{from the end of}} April until the end of May and results in loss of quality. Field experiments were carried out from 1998 until 2000 at Oudkarspel in the western region of The Netherlands with the objective of controlling slugs with the slug-parasitic nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) and common salt (sodium chloride (NaCl)). Nematodes and salt were applied as row applications in asparagus beds. Dosages of 10, 000 ¿ 600, 000 nematodes per m 2 were used. Salt was applied in doses of 500 ¿ 4000 kg NaCl per ha. Each of the treatments was applied from 1 to 4 times and was compared with conventional field application of metaldehyde pellets (0. 35 kg a. i. per ha) in an equal number of applications and with untreated plots. Significant protection of the crop was achieved with nematodes during the harvest period in 1999 and 2000, when nematodes were applied three times in the row at a dose of 50, 000 /m 2 (2000) or 100, 000 /m 2 (1999 and 2000). Additionally, salt applied at 2000 kg/ha twice (1998) or at a dose of 1000 kg applied four times (1998, 1999 and 2000) provided successful slug control. An application of slug-parasitic nematodes (Nemaslug®) is recommended once at a dose of 300, 000 /m 2 or three times at a dose of 50, 000 /m 2 as a row application for control of slug damage in <b>green</b> <b>asparagus</b> in The Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} food disinfection on the beneficial biothiol contents in a suite of vegetables consumed daily, including spinach, <b>green</b> bean, <b>asparagus,</b> cucumber, and red pepper. Four disinfection technologies commonly studied and/or used in food processing and preservation, including hydrogen peroxide, free chlorine, and gaseous- and aqueous-phase ozone, were examined with common dosages and contact times. Results indicate that the common disinfection technologies may result in significant loss of beneficial biothiols in vegetables which are essentially important to human health, For example, as much as 70 % of biothiols were lost when spinach was treated with hydrogen peroxide (5. 0 wt %) for 30 min. Approximately 48 - 54 % of biothiols were destroyed by free chlorine and gaseous- and aqueous-phase ozone under typical contacting conditions. In red pepper, about 60 - 71 % of reduced glutathione was oxidized by the disinfectants. The potential decrease in biothiols during disinfection was dependent upon the biothiol type, the disinfectant, and the vegetable. The effectiveness of total bacterial inactivation by the four disinfection technologies was concurrently evaluated. Results show that free chlorine is most effective, achieving disinfection efficiencies of greater than 4 log for all study vegetables. This study may provide important information for the food industry to design optimum contacting methods for vegetables to simultaneously achieve sufficient bacterial disinfection while minimizing loss of beneficial biothiols...|$|R
