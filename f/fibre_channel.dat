In disk drives usually the <b>Fibre</b> <b>Channel</b> Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) connection topology is used.

Recently other protocols for this field, like iSCSI and ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use copper twisted-pair cables for <b>Fibre</b> <b>Channel,</b> not fibre optics.

This work is an investigation of leaky ray (mode) attenuation in graded multimode fibres. In contrast to slab or rectangular dielectric waveguides, cylindrical fibres possess leaky modes which greatly modify their propagation properties. The power carried by such modes eventually diminishes to zero, thus adding no useful contribution to the signal transmission over <b>fibre</b> <b>channels.</b> Suitable filtering techniques are therefore proposed.

Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as {{they have less}} air drag) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives.

Another modern (as of 2013) enterprise SATA disk specifies an error rate of less than 10 non-recoverable read errors in every 1016 bits.

The results show the degradation in sensitivity as normalized delay spreads increase.

40|$|Abstract. In hollow fibres dialyzers blood {{flows in}} the <b>fibres</b> <b>channel</b> and plasma filtrates through their {{permeable}} wall {{to feed the}} flow of the permeate (dialyzate), which takes place among the fibres in the opposite direction. We investigate this fluid dynamical problem exploiting the existence of two separate scales: the one in the fibres direction (∼ 20 cm), and the one along the fibre radius (∼ 0. 1 mm). We formulate a mathematical model based on a two-scale approach providing a full description of the flows of the blood, of the dialyzate and the of the plasma through the membrane, {{as well as of the}} progressive increase of the hematocrit. The problem is characterized by various rather unusual features like the slip condition of blood on the membrane and the feedback loop of boundary data for the hematocrit. Blood rheology is assumed to be of shear-thinning type, with hematocrit dependent coefficients. Under some simplifications explicit solutions are found. We show how the necessity of respecting several constraints and of reaching some specific targets influences the selection of the geometrical and physical parameters of the system. Once the fluid dynamical problem has been solved, the removal from blood of chemicals like urea, etc. has been studied. 1. Introduction. Dialyzer...|$|R

They {{are used to}} compensate for the channel power imbalances accumulated along amplified long links and stabilise the channel optical powers. In multi-stage amplified optical links, channel power imbalances occur as a result two factors. Firstly, the emission and absorption cross-section variations across the erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) bandwidth result in channels experiencing different gains and acquiring unequal output power. Secondly, the output power imbalances are further deteriorated {{by the fact that the}} Er 3 + transition is predominantly homogeneously broadened at room temperature.
