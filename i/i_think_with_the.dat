2500|$|In early January 2013, {{the band}} {{announced}} that their fifth album {{would be released}} later in the year, and labelled the album The Chase. Fans assumed their fifth album would be titled this, however, the band later {{announced that it was}} only a [...] "working title" [...] and the new album does not have a name. Healy said: [...] That's the working title, it's not the actual one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whole Chasing The Saturdays and chasing success, we'll call it that for now. But it's not the definite title. We'll have another single and then the album. We've finished it though. The official artwork for the album was released on 4 September 2013, as well as the official title, Living for the Weekend. The album artwork features all five members of the band, before Rochelle Humes and Frankie Sandford's pregnancies. Healy explained that the title of the album came from the band's name The Saturdays. She explained by saying everybody [...] "lives for the weekend" [...] and the band's name is in the weekend, which made the title even more relevant.|$|E

6000|$|Penmaenmawr, Sept. 20.—It was so {{kind of you}} to see {{our little}} [...] fellows on their way through town. I hope they were not [...] troublesome.

Even if the Platonic epistles {{are taken}} as genuine, which Mr. Coleridge, to my surprise, was {{inclined}} to believe, they can hardly interfere, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> uniqueness of the truly incomparable collections from the correspondence of Cicero and Pliny.--ED.] ...|$|E
60|$|She sat {{thus for}} a long time; she had so much for which to thank God, though not with her lips, for how could they keep pace with her heart? Her heart was very full; chiefly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tears that rolled down unknown to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have missed}} {{nothing of the}} {{slightest}} importance," [...] returned Sir Patrick. [...] "I have placed you in possession of facts which you {{had a right to}} know; and we have now only to return to our medical friend's report on Blanche's health.

6000|$|But what I deplore still more, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> reason, is <b>the</b> total {{omission}} {{of the familiar}} interrogation: [...] "What is your impression of our women?" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>with</b> all <b>the</b> Navy activities, BUNAV {{might find}} {{something}} that colored enlistees could do {{in addition to the}} rating of messman.|$|R
6000|$|... "With all my heart. I think, however, Sir Reginald," [...] {{said the}} vice-admiral, as he {{approached}} the door; [...] "that even {{in the event of an}} escheat, you would find these Brunswick princes sufficiently liberal to restore the property. I could not answer for those wandering Scotchmen; who have so many breechless nobles to enrich; but, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hanoverians, you would be safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{think it}} may refer to your son, Mrs. Conway," [...] Major Barlow said. [...] "I have just {{returned}} from town, and happened to hear that a vessel had been spoken with that reported having picked up a lad from a smack run down in the channel some five months ago, which corresponds pretty well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> time your son was missing." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{words are}} true of all nature; and {{specially}} true, {{it seems to}} me, of our outward senses and faculties; true of sight, hearing, speech. The wonder, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wise man will be, not that there are deaf and dumb persons to be found here and there among us: but that the average, nay, the majority of mankind, are not deaf and dumb. Paradoxical as this assertion may seem at first, a little thought I believe will prove it to be reasonable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I think," [...] {{returned}} his brother. [...] "And another thing, Dick; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pointed chin is in <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brokers, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{seem to feel}} I {{know what}} he <b>thinks.</b> And <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> all <b>the</b> time you spent with him, you'd know it," [...] she said, [...] "yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I, Frank, to {{tell the}} truth; {{especially}} considering how badly you want it yourself. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> quarrelling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> uncle is {{the surest way to}} get the niece." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot imagine {{those young}} {{soldiers}} {{and the women}} they loved pleased with the ill-breeding and theatricality of Carlyle, nor <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> magniloquence of Hugo. These things belong to an industrial age, a mechanical sequence of ideas; but when I remember that curious game which the Japanese called, with a confusion of the senses that had seemed typical of our own age, 'listening to incense,' I know that some among them would have understood the prose of Walter Pater, the painting or Puvis de Chavannes, the poetry of Mallarmé and Verlaine. When heroism returned to our age it bore with it as its first gift technical sincerity.|$|E
6000|$|It {{absolutely}} startles me, {{now he is}} in my mind, to find how plainly I see him!--how {{much more}} plainly than I see Sir Percival, or Mr. Fairlie, or Walter Hartright, or any other absent person of whom <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> one exception of Laura herself! I can hear his voice, {{as if he was}} speaking at this moment. I know what his conversation was yesterday, as well as if I was hearing it now. How am I to describe him? There are peculiarities in his personal appearance, his habits, and his amusements, which I should blame in the boldest terms, or ridicule in the most merciless manner, if I had seen them in another man. What is it that makes me unable to blame them, or to ridicule them in HIM? ...|$|E
6000|$|We had a noble {{night last}} night. The room (which {{is the largest}} but one in England) was crammed in every part. The effect of from {{thirteen}} to fourteen hundred people, all well dressed, and all seated in one unbroken chamber, except that the floor rose high {{towards the end of}} the hall, was most splendid, and we never played to a better audience. The enthusiasm was prodigious; the place delightful for speaking in; no end of gas; another hall for a dressing-room; an immense stage; and every possible convenience. We were all thoroughly pleased, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, and it was a very great and striking success. To-morrow-night, having the new Hardman, I am going to try the play with all kinds of cuts, taking out, among other things, some half-dozen printed pages of [...] "Wills's Coffee House." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he assented, with {{a little}} glitter in his eyes, [...] "I have news. Things have moved <b>with</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of an idiotic Englishman, we shall solve the riddle of what our professors have called the {{consuming}} explosive. I sent the formula home to Germany, by a trusty hand, {{only a few hours}} ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{large number}} of the town folk are {{secretly}} either wholly with us or well disposed towards us; and, although some will doubtless take up arms on the other side, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advantage of <b>the</b> surprise, and <b>with</b> such assistance as our party can give you, there is every chance of bringing the enterprise to a successful issue.|$|R
5000|$|The Association for Swedish Landscape Protection is in {{opposition}} to wind power. Their chairman says: It is beginning to get through, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> existing nuclear and hydro power available in Sweden, the role for intermittent wind power is marginal and primarily as an exercise in the following of ”fashion”. It has little to contribute to either generation capacity or transmission security. And it is expensive. Elisabeth von Brömsen ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You see, Anders, {{we are now}} on very {{friendly}} terms with this tribe, {{and it seems to}} me that if we were to remain for a time and increase our influence, we might induce Grabantak to give up this war on which he seems to have set his heart. I have great hopes of doing something with Teyma. He is evidently a reasonable fellow, and has much power, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chief--indeed with every one. Pity that he is not to succeed Grabantak instead of that stupid Koyatuk. Besides, now I am here I must explore the land if possible. It is a pity no doubt to leave our friends, even for a short time, in ignorance of our fate, but we can't help that at present. Light the lamp, Anders, and let's see what we're about." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, {{though not}} often, he had dreams, {{and they were}} more painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours {{he could not be}} {{separated}} from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> riddle of his existence. At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped {{over the edge of the}} bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.|$|E
60|$|But {{although}} this narrow portal of escape {{be all that}} is absolutely necessary, I think that {{the dignity of the}} painting increases with the extent and amount of the expression. With the earlier and mightier painters of Italy, the practice is commonly to leave their distance of pure and open sky, of such simplicity, that it in nowise shall interfere with or draw the attention from the interest of the figures, and of such purity, that especially towards the horizon, it shall be in the highest degree expressive of the infinite space of heaven. I do not mean to say that they did this with any occult or metaphysical motives. They did it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> child-like, unpretending simplicity of all earnest men; they did what they loved and felt; they sought what the heart naturally seeks, and gave what it most gratefully receives; and I look to them as in all points of principle (not, observe, of knowledge or empirical attainment) as the most irrefragable authorities, precisely on account of the child-like innocence, which never deemed itself authoritative, but acted upon desire, and not upon dicta, and sought for sympathy, not for admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Forms!' she said. 'Forms! Is {{the spirit}} there? By their fruits ye shall know them. I ask you {{yourself}} whether {{his life as}} you have seen it is such as <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> conformable <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Word of God?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That makes it, I need hardly say, of {{no legal}} value," [...] the father went on, with frigid calm. [...] "I bring it round merely {{to show you}} that my son {{intended}} to act honorably towards you. As things stand, of course, he has died intestate, and his property, such as it is, will follow the ordinary law of succession. For your sake, I am sorry it should be so; I could have wished it otherwise. However, I need not remind you"--he picked his phrases carefully with icy precision--"that under circumstances like these neither you nor your child have any claim whatsoever upon my son's estate. Nor have I any right over it. Still"--he paused for a second, and that incisive mouth strove to grow gentle, while Herminia hot with shame, confronted him helplessly--"I sympathize with your position, and do not forget it was Alan who brought you here.

6000|$|They began, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "endless chain" [...] {{of letters}} of appeal. You may {{remember}} the device, {{for it was}} all-popular in clerical circles some ten or fifteen years ago. You got {{a number of people}} to write each of them three letters asking for ten cents from three each of their friends and asking each of them to send on three similar letters. Three each from three each, and three each more from each! Do you observe the wonderful ingenuity of it? Nobody, I think, has forgotten how the Willing Workers of the Church of England Church of Mariposa sat down in the vestry room in the basement with a pile of stationery three feet high, sending out the letters. Some, I know, will never forget it. Certainly not Mr. Pupkin, the teller in the Exchange Bank, for it was here that he met Zena Pepperleigh, the judge's daughter, for the first time; and they worked so busily that they wrote out ever so many letters--eight or nine--in a single afternoon, and they discovered that their handwritings were awfully alike, {{which was one of the}} most extraordinary and amazing coincidences, you will admit, in the history of chirography.|$|E
6000|$|My hope {{of coming}} up to town again has been defeated, and it comes over me that your {{departure}} is terribly near. Therefore I write you a line of hearty and affectionate farewell--mitigated by the sense that after all it is {{only for a few}} months that we are to lose you. I trust, serenely, to your own conviction of this fact, but for extra safety just remark that if you don't return to London next winter I shall hurl myself across the ocean at you like a lasso. As I look back upon the years of your mission my heart swells and almost breaks again (as it did when I heard you were superseded) at the thought that anything so perfect should be gratuitously destroyed. But there is a part of your function which can go on again, indefinitely, whenever you take it up--and that, I repeat, I hope you will do soon rather than late. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tenderest pleasure of the many fire-side talks I have had with you, from the first--and with a pleasure dimmed with sadness of so many of our more recent ones. You are tied to London now by innumerable cords and fibres, and I should be glad to think that you ever felt me, ever so lightly, pulling at one of them. It is a great disappointment to me not to see you again, but I am kept here fast and shall not be in town till the end of June. I give you my blessing and every good wish for a happy voyage. I wish I could receive you over there--and assist at your arrival and impressions--little as I want you to go back. Don't forget that you have produced a relation between England and the U.S. which is really a gain to civilization and that you must come back to look after your work. You can't look after it there: that is the function of an Englishman--and if you do it there they will call you one. The only way you can be a good American is to return to our dear old stupid, satisfactory London, and to yours ever affectionately and faithfully, ...|$|E
