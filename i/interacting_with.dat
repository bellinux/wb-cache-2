40|$|AbstractThe TRAPP vesicle-tethering complex {{consists}} {{of more than}} 10 distinct polypeptides and is involved in protein transport. Using the C 2 subunit as bait we identified SPATA 4, a spermatocyte-specific protein of unknown function, as an interacting partner in a yeast two hybrid screen. Further studies indicate SPATA 4 <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> the C 2 portion of the TRAPP complex. SPATA 4 fractionates with both cytosolic and nuclear fractions suggesting it may have several distinct functions. SPATA 4 {{is one of only}} three human proteins that contain a DUF 1042 domain and we show that C 2 does not <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> another one of the DUF 1042 domain-containing proteins. Our results suggest a role for SPATA 4 in membrane traffic and a specialized function for TRAPP in spermatocytes.

40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure. Here we identified apoptosis related protein 3 (APR 3), a membrane protein {{known as a}} proliferation suppressor, as a binding protein of NELL- 1 by biopanning. NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1. The co-expression of NELL- 1 and APR 3 enhanced Ocn and Bsp expression and mineralization. RNAi of APR 3 significantly reduced the differentiation effect of NELL- 1. These {{findings suggest that the}} effects of NELL- 1 on osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are partly through binding to APR 3.
