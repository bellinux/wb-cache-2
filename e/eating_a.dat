5|$|Adequate {{potassium}} intake {{is achieved}} by <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> variety of foods. Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.|$|E
5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples. The use of a dragon <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} to have {{concluded}} with Homer <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> pizza in his hospital bed following the operation, and with Marge asking a nurse where the pizza had come from. This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant, chewing on a slice of pizza in the hospital. The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care.|$|E
5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> wide range of insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is omnivorous, <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range of}} invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E
5000|$|The subjunctive mood, {{sometimes}} called conjunctive mood, has several uses in dependent clauses. Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, but {{it often is}} not obligatory. Example: [...] "I suggested that Paul <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", Paul is not in fact <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple. Contrast this with the sentence [...] "Paul <b>eats</b> <b>an</b> apple", where the verb [...] "to eat" [...] is in the present tense, indicative mood. Another way, especially in British English, of expressing this might be [...] "I suggested that Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", derived from [...] "Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{value of}} <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|Treatment with nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive.|$|E

5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten {{on the head and}} is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E

5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would {{want them to}} carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> ball of wasabi.|$|E

5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> model outweighs the benefit of <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
