She was the daughter of Giovanni Michele di Morra, baron of Favale, and Luisa Brancaccio, a noblewoman belonging to a Neapolitan family.

25|$|A {{paper by}} Israeli {{researcher}} Sandrine Boudana {{two years later}} analyzed responses to the Strauss-Kahn perp walk in French and American print media {{within the context of}} the countries' respective cultures. While the predominant theme was French media condemning the practice and American media defending it, commentators on both sides took the occasion to reflect inwardly. Some American writers said the French had a point, and French writers in turn noted the difficulty of enforcing the Guigou law in an era where technology cannot prevent the images it forbids from being viewed in France when published overseas. Others noted that the incident also showed the pitfalls of the French media's practice of not reporting on the private lives of politicians, noting that rape allegations had been raised <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> Strauss-Kahn on a French talk show with no media followup.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hoffman {{was given}} his first leading role (despite joking {{at the time}} [...] "Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I'd {{probably}} turn it into the non-leading-man part") in Todd Louiso's tragicomedy Love Liza (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years <b>earlier,</b> <b>about</b> a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, [...] "incredibly humble in its exploration of grief", but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the BBC wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed [...] "what he's truly capable of", but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000.|$|E

500|$|In a United States {{hardware}} sales {{estimate for}} July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month <b>earlier,</b> <b>about</b> 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price {{to match the}} DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012. Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line's [...] "final send-off" [...] and expects [...] "by {{this time next year}} its contributions to the market will be minuscule. After Christmas, Nintendo will effectively be a single-handheld system company, putting all of portable software efforts into the Nintendo 3DS." ...|$|E
500|$|On September16, 2000 a {{tropical}} wave [...] an elongated area of {{low air pressure}} moving {{from east to west}} [...] exited the west coast of Africa. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear. After moving across the Caribbean Sea, a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on September27. The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of upon receiving the data, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Fifteen at 2100UTC. The NHC later estimated the depression had formed three hours <b>earlier,</b> <b>about</b> [...] north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. Upon forming, the depression had good outflow, although the convection was not as organized. With an anticyclone over the system, the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest, a motion caused by weak steering winds. Late on September28, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it Keith, after another Hurricane Hunters mission reported flight-level winds of [...]|$|E
500|$|In late September 2010, a {{wide band}} of {{disturbed}} weather and low pressure, {{associated with the}} monsoon trough and remnant tropical moisture from Tropical Storm Matthew, meandered over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. With a broad upper ridge anchored along the Yucatán coast, diffluence aloft {{in the vicinity of}} the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered convection. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted an environment supportive of tropical development, and by September27, a broad surface low formed amid the convection. The next day, surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around the low proximated tropical storm force. Throughout the development process, moderate westerly wind shear over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure; it developed an elongated low-pressure center by September28, well to the northwest of its strongest wind field. Despite the asymmetry, the NHC initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15:00 UTC that day, after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection. Post-season reassessments, however, indicated that a tropical storm had in fact formed three hours <b>earlier,</b> <b>about</b> 75miles (120km) south of Cuba's Isle of Youth, which operationally was not named Nicole until a day later.|$|E

500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E
2500|$|A common {{argument}} used {{to dispute}} {{the significance of}} human caused climate change, which TIME Magazine calls the Ice Age Fallacy, is to allege that scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, therefore {{there is no need}} to heed current scientific concerns about climate change. In a 1998 article promoting the Oregon Petition, Fred Singer argued that expert concerns about global warming should be dismissed on the basis that what he called [...] "the same hysterical fears" [...] had supposedly been expressed <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> global cooling.|$|E
2500|$|Danny Rubin had {{completed}} and sold his script for Hear No Evil and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles {{to become a}} professional screenwriter around 1990. His agent suggested that he prepare a [...] "calling-card" [...] script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers. He {{came up with the}} core idea of the script which would become Groundhog Day while sitting in a movie theater. He had asked himself the question [...] "If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?" [...] Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif had found its [...] "deeper purpose" [...] within the new script. The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.|$|E

Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, [...] "Because I don't like you." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Talmud, the Torah's {{explicit}} dating of {{the life}} of Ishmael helps to date various events in Jacob's life and, by implication, the age of Rebecca at her death. Ishmael was born when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. 16:16) and {{died at the age of}} 137 (Gen. 25:17). Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 (Gen. 21:5); at that time Ishmael was 14. Jacob and Esau were born when Isaac was 60 (Gen. 25:26); at that time Ishmael was 74. Right after Jacob receives the blessings and flees to Laban, the Torah states that Esau married [...] "Mahalat, the daughter of Ishmael, son of Abraham, sister of Nebaiot" [...] (Gen. 28:9), on which Rashi, quoting Megillah 17a, notes that Ishmael died between the engagement and wedding, so the girl's brother gave her away. If Ishmael was 137 at the time of his death, this means that Jacob and Esau were 63 at the time of the blessings. The Talmud adds that Jacob spent 39 years in the yeshiva of Shem and Eber before proceeding to Laban, arriving when he was 77. Rebecca's death after Jacob's 20 years with Laban indicates that Jacob was 72 when his mother died and Rebecca was either 120 or 134 (based on different Midrashim mentioned <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> her age at marriage).|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 {{the school}} was one of fifty of the country's leading {{independent}} schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by The Times newspaper, although the schools made clear {{that they had not}} realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months <b>earlier)</b> <b>about</b> the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. However, Mrs Jean Scott, the then-head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, [...] "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed".|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the academies {{that was}} instituted during the 2011-2012 school year. The FOCUS academy {{attempted}} to focus in on the 13% of students in the entire high school. [...] Speaking <b>earlier</b> <b>about</b> the plans, district superintendent Dr. Richard N. Johns said there are four types of students that would be targeted for the FOCUS academy — students who are at risk of dropping out, not graduating on time, not graduating and receiving a General Education Diploma, and students who are graduating with a 75 percent average or below. This program will be flexible with time and will allow students to come for their core classes and graduation requirements and leave {{for the remainder of the}} day, should they have to work or other extenuating circumstances. This academy was scheduled to be the first one implemented and was set to be used in the 2011–2012 school year. This academy was housed in the Wetzel Road Elementary building, which was closed last spring because of declining enrollment and an $11 million budget shortfall. It will first need a few renovations including new gang bathrooms and science laboratories. The FOCUS academy was ultimately shut down after in session for one year as it was deemed a major waste as a part of the school budget without any significant improvements by students.|$|E
