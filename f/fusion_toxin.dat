40|$|B {{lymphocyte}} stimulator (BLyS) {{is crucial}} for B-cell survival, and the biological effects of BLyS are mediated by three cell surface receptors designated B cell– activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), transmembrane acti-vator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and B-cell maturation antibody (BCMA). Increased expression of BLyS and its receptors has been identified in numerous B-cell malignancies. We generated a <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> designated rGel/BLyS for receptor-mediated delivery of the recombinant gelonin (rGel) toxin to neo-plastic B cells, and we characterized its activity against various B-cell tumor lines. Three mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines (JeKo- 1, Mino, and SP 53) and two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines (SUDHL- 6 and OCI-Ly 3) expressing all three distinct BLyS receptors {{were found to be}} the most sensitive to the <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> (IC 50 = 2 – 5 pmol/L and 0. 001 – 5 nmol/L for MCL and DLBCL, respectively). The rGel/BLyS <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> showed specific binding to cells expressing BLyS receptors and rapid internalization of the rGel component into target cells. The cytotoxic effects of rGel/BLyS were inhibited by pretreatment with free BLyS or with soluble BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA decoy receptors. This suggests that the cytotoxic effects of the <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> are mediated through BLyS receptors. The rGel/BLyS <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> inhibited MCL cell growth through induction of apoptosis associated with caspase- 3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymer-ase cleavage. Our results suggest that BLyS has the potential to serve as an excellent targeting ligand for the specific delivery of cytotoxic molecules to neoplastic B cells expressing the BLyS receptors, and that the rGel/ BLyS <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> may be an excellent candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies especially MCL and DLBCL.

40|$|Background: Acute {{myelogenous leukemia}} (AML) {{is the second}} most common leukemia with {{approximately}} 13, 410 new cases and 8, 990 deaths annually in the United States. A novel <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> treatment, diphtheria toxin GM-CSF (DT-GMCSF) has been shown to selectively eliminate leukemic repopulating cells that are critical for the formation of AML. We previously showed that DT-GMCSF treatment of U 937 cells, an AML cell line, causes activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis. Methods and Findings: In this study we further investigate the mechanisms of cell death induced by DT-GMCSF and show that, in addition to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, DT-GMCSF also kills AML cells by simultaneously activating caspase-independent necroptosis. These mechanisms depend on the ability of the targeted toxin to inhibit protein synthesis, and are not affected by the receptor that is targeted or the mechanism through which protein synthesis is blocked.

Here, we report use of the enzyme sortase A (SrtA) to create four chimeric toxins designed to selectively kill cells bearing the tumor marker HER 2.

Bothproteins carriedat theC terminus the sortase recognition sequence LPETGG and a H 6 affinity tag. Each toxin protein was mixed with SrtA plus either of two HER 2 -recognition proteins—a single-chain antibody fragment or an Affibody—both carrying an N-terminal G 5 tag. With wild-type SrtA, the fusion reaction between the toxin and receptor-recognition proteins approached completion only after several hours, whereas with an evolved form of the enzyme, SrtA, the reaction was virtually complete within 5 minutes.

40|$|A 10 -aa motif in transmembrane helix 1 of {{diphtheria}} toxin that is conserved in anthrax edema factor, anthrax lethal factor, and botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, C, and D {{was identified}} by blast, clustal w, and meme computational analysis. Using the diphtheria toxin-related <b>fusion</b> protein <b>toxin</b> DAB 389 IL- 2, we demonstrate that {{introduction of the}} L 221 E mutation into a highly conserved residue within this motif results in a nontoxic catalytic domain translocation deficient phenotype.

We previously generated a rGel/BLyS <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> for receptor-mediated delivery of the rGel toxin specifically to malignant B cells. In this study, we examined this <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> for its ability to suppress DLBCL growth in vitro and in vivo. rGel/BLyS was specifically cytotoxic to DLBCL lines expressing all three BLyS receptors and constitutively active NF-κB. Treatment with rGel/BLyS induced down-regulation of the phosphorylation of inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (IκB-α), inhibition of NF-κB DNA-binding activity, and accumulation of IκB-α. In agreement with these results, we additionally found that rGel/BLyS downregulated levels of several NF-κB targets including Bcl-xL, Mcl- 1, survivin, and x-chromosome linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis. Treatment also induced up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis through caspase- 3 activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. Importantly, rGel/BLyS significantly inhibited tumor growth (P <. 05) in a DLBCL xenograft model.

Techniques for limiting smooth muscle cell proliferation, however, have not as yet yielded any therapeutic benefit for these conditions. This may reflect the present lack of sufficiently potent and specific inhibitors of smooth muscle cell proliferation. DAB 389 EGF is a genetically engineered fusion protein in which the receptor-binding domain of diphtheria toxin {{has been replaced by}} human epidermal growth factor. We evaluated the effect of this <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> on human vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Incubation of proliferating cells with DAB 389 EGF yielded a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis, as assessed by uptake of [3 H]leucine, with an IC 50 of 40 pM. The cytotoxic effect was inhibited in the presence of excess EGF or with monoclonal antibody to the EGF receptor. We further studied the effect of the <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> on smooth muscle cell outgrowth from human atherosclerotic plaque. Outgrowth was markedly inhibited after as little as 1 h of exposure to the fusion protein. Furthermore, complete inhibition of proliferation of cells within the plaque could be attained. These results demonstrate that DAB 389 EGF is highly cytotoxic to human smooth muscle cells proliferating in culture and can prevent smooth muscle cell outgrowth from "growth-stimulated" human atherosclerotic plaque.

The characteristics of the recombinant protein were assessed by ELISA, flow cytometry, and toxicity assays showing specific activity against CD 30 (+) Hodgkin-derived cells. Specific binding activity of Ang-CD 30 L was verified by competition with anti-CD 30 monoclonal antibody Ki- 4 and commercially available CD 30 L-CD 8 chimeric protein. Ang-CD 30 L showed RNase activity in vitro. The human recombinant immunotoxin showed significant toxicity toward several CD 30 -positive cell lines (HDLM- 2, L 1236, KM-H 2, and L 540 Cy) and exhibited highest cytotoxicity against L 540 cells (IC 50 = 8 ng/ml) as determined by cell proliferation assays.

Fusion of the anti-EpCAM DARPin Ec 1 to ETA″ and expression in methionine-auxotrophic E. coli enabled introduction of the nonnatural amino acid azidohomoalanine (Aha) at position 1 for strain-promoted click PEGylation. PEGylated Ec 1 -ETA″ was characterized by detailed biochemical analysis, and its potential for tumor targeting was assessed using carcinoma cell lines of various histotypes in vitro, and subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in vivo. The mild click reaction resulted in a well-defined mono-PEGylated product, which could be readily purified to homogeneity. Despite an increased hydrodynamic radius resulting from the polymer, the <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> demonstrated high EpCAM-binding activity and retained cytotoxicity in the femtomolar range. Pharmacologic analysis in mice unveiled an almost 6 -fold increase in the elimination half-life (14 vs. 82 minutes) and a more than 7 -fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) compared with non-PEGylated Ec 1 -ETA″, which directly translated in increased and longer-lasting effects on established tumor xenografts.

However, despite {{replacement of the}} natural cell-binding domain of ETA by tumor-selective antibodies or alternative binding proteins like designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) the therapeutic window of such fusion toxins is still limited by target-independent cellular uptake, resulting in toxicity in normal tissues. Furthermore, the strong immunogenicity of the bacterial toxin precludes repeated administration in most patients. Site-specific modification to convert ETA into a prodrug-like toxin which is reactivated specifically in the tumor, {{and at the same}} time has a longer circulation half-life and is less immunogenic, is therefore appealing. To engineer a prodrug-like <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> consisting of the anti-EpCAM DARPin Ec 1 and a domain I-deleted variant of ETA (ETA″), we used strain-promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition for bioorthogonal conjugation of linear or branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers at defined positions within the toxin moiety.

We identified two distinct sites, one within the catalytic domain and one close to the C-terminal KDEL sequence of Ec 1 -ETA″, simultaneous PEGylation of which resulted in up to 1000 -fold lower cytotoxicity in EpCAM-positive tumor cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: Designed ankyrin repeat {{proteins}} (DARPins) hold {{great promise}} {{as a new}} class of binding molecules to overcome the limitations of antibodies for biomedical applications. Here, we assessed the potential of an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) -specific DARPin (Ec 4) for tumor targeting as a <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> with Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DARPin Ec 4 was genetically fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA″) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The cytotoxicity of Ec 4 -ETA″ was measured against tumor cell lines of various histotypes in vitro. Tumor localization and antitumor activity were determined in mice bearing 2 different EpCAM-positive tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Ec 4 -ETA″ expressed very well in soluble form in the cytoplasm of E. coli and yielded up to 40 mg after purification per liter of culture. The protein was monomeric and the disulfides of ETA″ formed spontaneously. Ec 4 -ETA″ bound to EpCAM with low nanomolar affinity, similar to free Ec 4. Furthermore, it was highly cytotoxic against various EpCAM-positive tumor cell lines in vitro with IC(50) values less than 0. 005 pmol/L. This effect was competed by free Ec 4, but not by unspecific DARPins. Upon systemic administration in athymic mice, Ec 4 -ETA″ efficiently localized to EpCAM-positive tumors to achieve maximum accumulation 48 to 72 hours after injection, whereas an irrelevant control <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> did not accumulate. Tumor targeting with Ec 4 -ETA″ resulted in a strong antitumor response including complete regressions in some animals.

Methods To investigate if inhibition of the Rho pathway augments the neurite extension that naturally occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) following nerve damage, dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cell co-cultures were incubated with culture medium, C 3 <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin,</b> and the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors Y 27632 and H 1152. The longest neurite per neuron were measured and compared. Incubation with Y 27632 and H 1152 resulted in significantly longer neurites than controls when the neurons were in contact with Schwann cells. When separated by a porous P. E. T. membrane, only the group incubated with H 1152 developed significantly longer neurites. This work demonstrates that Rho kinase inhibition augments neurite elongation {{in the presence of}} contact with a PNS-like substrate. </p...|$|E
5000|$|Botulinum Toxin (BTX) is a {{group of}} {{neurotoxins}} consisting of eight distinct compounds, referred to as BTX-A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, which are produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and lead to muscular paralysis. A notably unique feature of BTX is its relatively common therapeutic use in treating dystonia and spasticity disorders, as well as in inducing muscular atrophy despite being the most poisonous substance known. BTX functions peripherally to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction through degradation of the SNARE proteins required for ACh vesicle-membrane <b>fusion.</b> As the <b>toxin</b> is highly biologically active, an estimated dose of 1μg/kg body weight is sufficient to induce an insufficient tidal volume and resultant death by asphyxiation. Due to its high toxicity, BTX antitoxins have been an active area of research. It has been shown that capsaicin (active compound responsible for heat in chili peppers) can bind the TRPV1 receptor expressed on cholinergic neurons and inhibit the toxic effects of BTX.|$|R
40|$|Alveolar {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} (ARMS) cells often harbor {{one of two}} unique chromosomal translocations, either t(2; 13) (q 35;q 14) or t(1; 13) (p 36;q 14). The chimeric proteins expressed {{from these}} rearrangements, PAX 3 -FKHR and PAX 7 -FKHR, respectively, are potent transcriptional activators. In an effort to exploit these unique cancer-specific molecules to achieve ARMS-specific expression of therapeutic genes, we have studied {{the expression of a}} minimal promoter linked to six copies of a PAX 3 DNA binding site, prs- 9. In transient transfections, expression of the prs- 9 -regulated reporter genes was ≈ 250 -fold higher than expression of genes lacking the prs- 9 sequences in cell lines derived from ARMS, but remained at or below baseline levels in other cells. High expression of these prs- 9 -regulated genes was also observed in a cancer cell line that lacks t(2; 13) but was stably transfected with a plasmid expressing PAX 3 -FKHR. Transfection of a plasmid containing the diphtheria toxin A chain gene regulated by prs- 9 sequences (pA 3 – 6 PED) was selectively cytotoxic for PAX 3 -FKHR-expressing cells. This was shown by inhibition of gene expression from cotransfected plasmids and by direct cytotoxicity after transfected cells were isolated by cell sorting. Gene transfer of pA 3 – 6 PED may thus be useful as a cancer-specific treatment strategy for t(2; 13) - or t(1; 13) -positive ARMS. Furthermore, gene transfer of <b>fusion</b> protein-regulated <b>toxin</b> genes might also be applied to the treatment of other cancers that harbor cancer-specific chromosomal translocations involving transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant {{fusion protein}} {{technology}} allows specific insecticidal protein and peptide toxins to display activity in orally-delivered bio-pesticides. Here, some small cysteine-rich protein toxins were evaluated as insecticides, including δ-amaurobitoxin-Pl 1 a (Pl 1 a) from tangled nest spider (Pireneitega luctuosa), ω-atracotoxin-Hv 1 a (Hv 1 a) from funnel web spider (Hadronyche versuta) and κ-theraphotoxin-Ec 2 a (Ec 2 a) from Eucratoscelus constrictus, which target insect voltage-gated sodium channels, calcium activated potassium channels and voltage-regulated potassium channels, respectively. Recombinant proteins were produced using the yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host, {{by combining the}} coding sequences of the toxin with that of snowdrop lectin ("carrier"), that can deliver these toxins to {{the central nervous system}} of the target pest. Experimental results showed the toxins alone had limited or even no activities without being fused to the N-terminal of snowdrop lectin "carrier". Further, <b>fusion</b> of <b>toxins</b> to proteins other than snowdrop lectin also gave products with low or no biological activity. The absence of biological activity suggested that the toxin protein was not folding properly when expressed without fusion to the snowdrop lectin carrier, which meant GNA could not only direct transport of the toxins across the insect gut as a carrier, but also can help toxins to achieve correct folding. For example, the toxin Pl 1 a and a Pl 1 a/GNA fusion protein both caused mortality when injected into cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) larvae, but the Pl 1 a/GNA fusion protein was approximately 6 times as effective as recombinant Pl 1 a on a molar basis. Pl 1 a alone was not orally active against cabbage moth larvae, but a single 30 μg dose of the Pl 1 a/GNA fusion protein caused 100...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the antiangiogenic and antitumor ef-ficacies of a vasculature-targeting <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> (VEGF 121 /rGel) composed of the VEGF-A isoform VEGF 121 linked with a G 4 S tether to recombinant plant toxin gelonin (rGel) in an orthotopic glioblastomamousemodel by use of noninvasive in vivo biolumi-nescence imaging (BLI), MRI, and PET.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{recently}} demonstrated that actin depolymerization {{is a prerequisite}} for cAMP-dependent translocation of the water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) into the apical membrane in AQP 2 -transfected renal CD 8 cells (29). The Rho family of small GTPases, including Cdc 42, Rac, and Rho, regulates the actin cytoskeleton. In AQP 2 -transfected CD 8 cells, inhibition of Rho GTPases with Clostridium difficile toxin B or with C. limosum C 3 <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin,</b> as well as incubation with the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y- 27632, caused actin depolymerization and translocation of AQP 2 {{in the absence of the}} cAMP- elevating agent forskolin. Both forskolin and C 3 fusion toxin-induced AQP 2 translocation were associated with a similar increase in the osmotic water permeability coefficient. Expression of constitutively active RhoA induced formation of stress fibers and abolished AQP 2 translocation in response to forskolin. Cytochalasin D induced both depolymerization of F-actin and AQP 2 translocation, suggesting that depolymerization of F-actin is sufficient to induce AQP 2 translocation. Together, these data indicate that Rho inhibits cAMP-dependent translocation of AQP 2 into the apical membrane of renal principal cells by controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|E
40|$|Single and {{multiple}} doses of sCD 4 -PE 40, a soluble recombinant <b>fusion</b> <b>toxin</b> selectively toxic to gp 120 -expressing cells, were evaluated in persons infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I (HIV-I). Seventeen of 24 patients who completed a single-dose safety trial were given either 1, 5, 10, or 15 p. g/kg ofsCD 4 -PE 40 by intravenous bolus once a month for 2 months, then weekly for 6 weeks. The weekly maximally tolerated dose was 10 ILg/kg. The major toxicity was a transient dose-dependent elevation in hepatic aminotransferases peaking 48 h after infu-sion. Anti-Pseudomonas exotoxin antibody developed in 58 % of recipients, and sera from 13 of 17 showed neutralizing activity against sCD 4 -PE 40. No consistent changes in immunologic or virologic markers were observed. Weekly infusions of ~IO ILg/kg of sCD 4 -PE 40 are generally well tolerated, but additional studies correlating optimal dosing and frequency of administration with efficacy {{will be needed to}} define the role of this novel agent in the management of HIV- 1 -in-fected patients.

40|$|Background: Leishmaniasis {{remains a}} {{significant}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} in the tropics. Available therapies are problematic due to toxicity, treatment duration and emerging drug resistance. Mouse models of leishmaniasis have demonstrated that disease outcome depends critically on the balance between effector and regulatory CD 4 + T cell responses, something mirrored in descriptive studies of human disease. Recombinant IL- 2 /diphtheria <b>toxin</b> <b>fusion</b> protein (rIL- 2 /DTx), a drug that is FDA-approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, has been reported to deplete regulatory CD 4 + T cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the potential efficacy of rIL- 2 /DTx as adjunctive therapy for experimental infection with Leishmania major. Treatment with rIL- 2 /DTx suppressed lesional regulatory T cell numbers and was associated with significantly increased antigen-specific IFN-c production, enhanced lesion resolution and decreased parasite burden. Combined administration of rIL- 2 /DTx and sodium stibogluconate had additive biological and therapeutic effects, allowing for reduced duration or dose of sodium stibogluconate therapy. Conclusions/Significance: These data suggest that pharmacological suppression of immune counterregulation using a commercially available drug originally developed for cancer therapy may have practical therapeutic utility in leishmaniasis.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by the Medical Research Council [Grant number: G 1002117] and a PhD studentship from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) is the dominant synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis mode in central nerve terminals during intense neuronal activity. By definition, this mode is triggered by neuronal activity; however, key questions regarding its mechanism of activation remain unaddressed. To determine the basic requirements for ADBE triggering in central nerve terminals, we decoupled SV fusion events from activity-dependent calcium influx using either clostridial neurotoxins or buffering of intracellular calcium. ADBE was monitored both optically and morphologically by observing uptake of the fluid phase markers tetramethylrhodamine-dextran and horse radish peroxidase respectively. Ablation of SV <b>fusion</b> with tetanus <b>toxin</b> resulted in the arrest of ADBE, but had no effect on other calcium-dependent events such as activity-dependent dynamin I dephosphorylation, indicating that SV exocytosis is necessary for triggering. Furthermore, the calcium chelator EGTA abolished ADBE while leaving SV exocytosis intact, demonstrating that ADBE is triggered by intracellular free calcium increases outside the active zone. Activity-dependent dynamin I dephosphorylation was also arrested in EGTA-treated neurons, consistent with its proposed role in triggering ADBE. Thus SV fusion and increased cytoplasmic free calcium are both necessary but not sufficient individually to trigger ADBE. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
