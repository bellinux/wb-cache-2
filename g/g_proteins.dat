25|$|If a {{receptor}} in {{an active}} state encounters a G protein, it may activate it. Some {{evidence suggests that}} receptors and <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> are actually pre-coupled. For example, binding of <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> to receptors affects the receptor's affinity for ligands. Activated <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> are bound to GTP.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} with GPCRs, {{proteins}} that bind GTP {{play a major role in}} signal transduction from the activated RTK into the cell. In this case, the <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> are members of the Ras, Rho, and Raf families, referred to collectively as small <b>G</b> <b>proteins.</b> They act as molecular switches usually tethered to membranes by isoprenyl groups linked to their carboxyl ends. Upon activation, they assign proteins to specific membrane subdomains where they participate in signaling. Activated RTKs in turn activate small <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> that activate guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as SOS1. Once activated, these exchange factors can activate more small <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> thus amplifying the receptor's initial signal. The mutation of certain RTK genes, as with that of GPCRs, can result in the expression of receptors that exist in a constitutively activated state; such mutated genes may act as oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP), <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector. This short circuit is membrane-delimiting, allowing direct gating of calcium channels by <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> to produce effects more quickly than the cAMP cascade could. This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca2+ channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.|$|E
25|$|Further signal {{transduction}} {{depends on the}} type of <b>G</b> <b>protein.</b> The enzyme adenylate cyclase {{is an example of a}} cellular protein that can be regulated by a <b>G</b> <b>protein,</b> in this case the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> <b>Gs.</b> Adenylate cyclase activity is activated when it binds to a subunit of the activated <b>G</b> <b>protein.</b> Activation of adenylate cyclase ends when the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> returns to the GDP-bound state.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that trimers of the {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV <b>G</b> <b>protein)</b> are in rapid equilibrium with monomeric subunits after folding and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To determine whether <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> trimers were in equilibrium with monomers in other cellular compartments, we studied heterotrimer formation between VSV <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> and a mutant <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> (<b>G</b> mu <b>protein)</b> containing a 3 -amino-acid cytoplasmic domain replacing the normal 29 -amino-acid domain.

In coexpression experiments, we observed that VSV <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> molecules exited the ER about sixfold faster than <b>G</b> mu <b>protein</b> molecules, and we observed no heterotrimer formation in the ER, probably because of rapid reassortment of the mutant and wild-type trimers. However, heterotrimer formation between the two proteins was observed after long chase periods that allowed time for trimers of the mutant protein to reach the plasma membrane and reassort with the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> subunits.

40|$|A soluble {{form of the}} G glycoprotein, the {{attachment}} protein, of respiratory syncytial virus is shed from infected HEp- 2 cells.

25|$|The {{cholera toxin}} (CTX or CT) is an {{oligomeric}} complex {{made up of}} six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides {{on the surface of}} the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.|$|E

Furthermore, a vaccine to protect IHNV sensitive salmonid hosts must be based on the <b>G</b> <b>protein.</b> IHNV isolated from selected geographic locations has been grouped into five distinct biochemical types (Hsu et al., 1986). This diversity of IHNV strains was examined by immunological cross neutralization comparisons and by protection studies using a single IHNV isolate, type 1, as the source of <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> for vaccination. It was found that the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> from Type 1 IHNV could confer protection from challenge with the four other IHNV types. The immunological comparison of ten IHNV isolates identifies a variant group. However, only a single serotype of IHNV was defined. No direct relation between biochemical type and immunological group was found. A comparison of a temperature sensitive IHNV isolate, CO 2, and a nontemperature sensitive IHNV isolate, RB 1, by endoglycosidase digestion of the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> indicates carbohydrate differences are responsible for molecular weight differences in the <b>G</b> <b>protein.</b> It is proposed that temperature sensitivity and immunological differences may also be accounted for by glycosylation variations of the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> of IHNV CO 2...|$|R
