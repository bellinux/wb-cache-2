Each treatment was replicated two times. The attributes observed were physical analysis (expressible moisture content, gel strength and folding test), chemical analysis (moisture content, protein content and fat content) and sensory analysis (aroma, taste and colour).

A functional food that could potentially impede progression into a hypertensive state in pre-hypertensive individuals is of significant interest to clinicians and consumers. In vitro and animal studies suggest the presence of potential ACE inhibitory dairy- and soy-derived peptides. Very few human-based research {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the blood pressure lowering and/or ACE-inhibitory effects of whey and <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> hydrolysates in humans. This pilot study tested the acute effects of 20 g doses of whey and soy hydrolysates in pre-hypertensive, overweight men and postmenopausal women on serum ACE activity and blood pressure. Findings: Using a randomized crossover design, four initial subjects received five treatments (unhydrolyzed casein, whey protein <b>isolate,</b> whey <b>protein</b> hydrolysate, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> hydrolysate) at different testing visits separated by three-day washout periods. Blood pressure and blood draws to measure ACE activity were taken at thirty minute intervals following treatment consumption. Both the <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> and whey protein hydrolysates had notable in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, both before and after heat treatment. No differences were observed among the protein treatments for either ACE activity or systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study support a discrepancy between in vitro and human-based in vivo ACE-inhibitory acute effects of whey and <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> hydrolysates, underscoring the need for further research to better understand potential explanations for these findings...|$|R
40|$|Several {{tests for}} the {{detection}} of <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> in foods have been described in the literature, and some are commercially available. This article gives an overview of these methods and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each individual method. Based on the conclusions of this inventory, an experimental approach was designed to improve the sensitivity of measuring <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in processed foods. The aimed sensitivity is 10 ppm (10 ¿g <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in 1 g solid sample), which is over 100 -fold lower than presently available tests. The aimed sensitivity is this low because levels of food allergens at 10 ppm and above may provoke reactions in food allergic persons. Native soybean meal, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> concentrate, and textured soy flakes were used as test materials. Several extraction procedures were compared and a new method using high pH was selected. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and goats, and immunopurified antibodies were used in sandwich and inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Extraction at pH 12 resulted in good yields for all tested samples, both quantitatively (Bradford) and qualitatively by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunopurified rabbit antibodies against this extract used in a competition ELISA format resulted in a sensitive test with a detection limit of 0. 02 ¿g/mL, corresponding to 0. 4 ¿g/g (0. 4 ppm) in food samples. Cross-reactivity with some main food ingredients was measured and appeared to be negative in all cases. The presently developed test is applicable for soy ingredients and soy-containing foods that are processed in different ways. The limit of quantitation is 1 ppm, which is an enormous improvement over earlier described methods...|$|R

40|$|<b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> {{products}} are gaining importance as {{ingredients in the}} food industry. A number of soybean meals have been investigated as starting materials {{for the production of}} <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> ingredients. Hexane-extracted and flash-desolventized soybean meals, known as white flakes (WF), are most commonly used, but have disadvantages of containing solvent residue and being too expensive for processing identity-preserved soybeans. Gas-supported screw pressing (GSSP) is a new soybean oil-extraction process that combines screw pressing with injecting carbon dioxide (CO 2) under pressure. The objective of the present research was to investigate GSSP meal and its protein products by determining yields, composition, functional properties, preservation methods and sensory properties. The properties of GSSP meal proteins were compared to traditional <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> products produced from WF. For the laboratory-scale study, analytical, chemical and functionality tests were performed on the starting materials and <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>proteins.</b> <b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> (SPI) prepared from GSSP meal had higher protein yield, fat content, water-holding capacity (WHC) and viscosity, and better emulsification and fat-binding properties than SPIs prepared from WF. The SPIs produced in the pilot plant were analyzed for composition and functionality. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) treated SPIs were compared to jet-cooked SPIs. GSSP SPIs did not differ in functionality from SPIs prepared from WF, except for having lower solubility and poorer foaming properties. H 2 O 2 used as a preservative improved solubility, emulsification and foaming properties and reduced glycinin and β–conglycinin (β–con) denaturation. A descriptive sensory panel study with 12 trained panelists evaluated the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel of SPI and glycinin–rich (gly–rich) and β–conglycinin–rich (β–con–rich) <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> fractions extracted from both GSSP meal and WF. Protein products prepared from GSSP meal were similar to protein products prepared from WF except for having greater mouthcoating. Regardless of starting material, the gly–rich and β–con–rich fractions had stronger fishy aroma, less floury aroma, less raw beany aroma and less floury flavor than the SPIs. Hunter color LAB data indicated GSSP meal was more yellow (higher b* value) in color compared to WF. SPIs were darker (lower L* value) than than the gly–rich and β –con–rich fractions. Overall, protein products prepared from GSSP meal were similar in composition, functional and sensory properties to protein products prepared from WF. These findings demonstrate that the GSSP process can produce defatted meals suitable for manufacturing <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> ingredients. Because GSSP plants can be profitable at low capacity (50 mt/day) compared to solvent extraction (3000 mt/day), GSSP is suitable for processing identitypreserved soybeans that contain value-added traits. Additional benefits are that there are no concerns over residual organic solvents and the process complies with “organic“ definitions...|$|R

There is interest to understand whether these sources differ in their ability to maintain or stimulate muscle growth and function. In this study, baseline muscle performance was assessed in 50 adult Sprague-Dawley rats after which they were assigned to one of five semi-purified "Western" diets (n = 10 /group) differing only in protein source, namely 19 kcal% protein from either milk protein isolate (MPI), whey <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> (WPI), <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> (SPI), <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> concentrate (SPC) or enzyme-treated <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> (SPE). The diets were fed for 8 weeks at which point muscle performance testing was repeated and tissues were collected for analysis. There {{was no significant difference in}} food consumption or body weights over time between the diet groups nor were there differences in terminal organ and muscle weights or in serum lipids, creatinine or myostatin. Compared with MPI-fed rats, rats fed WPI and SPC displayed a greater maximum rate of contraction using the in vivo measure of muscle performance (p< 0. 05) with increases ranging from 13. 3 - 27. 5 % and 22. 8 - 29. 5 %, respectively at 60, 80, 100 and 150 Hz. When the maximum force was normalized to body weight, SPC-fed rats displayed increased force compared to MPI (p< 0. 05), whereas when normalized to gastrocnemius weight, WPI-fed rats displayed increased force compared to MPI (p< 0. 05).

In conclusion, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> consumption, in high-fat diet, resulted in muscle function comparable to whey protein and improved compared to milk protein.

Furthermore, it seems that when particles were largely deformable a (semi-) continuous protein network was formed in which individual particles could not be distinguished anymore. Then, the WBC of the pellet did not represent the WBC of the original particles anymore. Consequently, it was concluded that the WBC of the pellet (WBC-P) differs from the WBC of the particles. Therefore, the characteristics of the particles and their pellets were further investigated with, among others, time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD NMR). TD NMR {{turned out to be a}} useful additional tool to do this, and has the potential to give an indication of the amount of water present in each water domain. From the information obtained about the characteristics of the particles and their pellets, it could be concluded that variations in the WBC-P were the result of differences in the deformability of the particles (i. e., their capability to swell and to withstand the centrifugal force), and their ability to bind water interstitially. </p...|$|R

5000|$|When {{measuring}} the nutritional value of protein, the original {{protein efficiency ratio}} (PER) method, first proposed by Thomas Burr Osborne and Lafayette Mendel in 1917, was {{the most widely used}} method until 1990. This method was found to be flawed for the biological evaluation of protein quality because the young rats used in the study had higher relative requirements for sulfur-containing amino acids than did humans.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the degree of protein {{hydrolysis}} and feed concentration of protein were tested on corn meal extrudates using a single screw extrusion system. Four different concentrations of whey protein isolate (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %) with differing levels of hydrolysis (0 %, 4. 5 %, 10. 0 %, and 14. 9 %) were mixed with corn meal and then extruded. Samples of the extrudates were tested for breaking strength, apparent density, true powder density, expansion ratios, and porosity. It was found that extrudates containing the hydrolyzed proteins had physical characteristics {{similar to those of the}} 100 % corn meal samples. Many of the undesirable effects of adding unhydrolyzed protein to extrusion feed mixtures either did not occur or occurred to a lesser extent when partially hydrolyzed proteins were added. It was also found that as the degree of protein hydrolysisiii and as the protein concentration of the extrusion feed mixture increased the breaking strength and the apparent density of the extrudate decreased to values that were lower than the extrudate of the control corn meal. Extrusion runs that utilized hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed forms of the <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> produced similar results which suggests that changes in the physical properties of protein hydrolysate fortified corn meal extrudates are independent of the protein source. i...|$|R

In addition, the relative cryoprotective effects of whey protein concentrate, whey <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> flaxseed meal and flaxseed protein were assessed in surimi during storage. Raw surimi was prepared by repeatedly washing Alaska pollock flesh with chilled water. The product was either slowly frozen or underwent rapid freezing using liquid air; in either case it was then subjected to frozen storage at - 20 °C for 24 months. Protein structural changes were monitored using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR/ATR spectroscopy showed that during preparation of surimi the alpha-helix content increased with increased number of washing cycles. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to a higher temperature during surimi preparation. All electrophoresis, FTIR/ATR spectroscopy and DSC results revealed a loss of myofibrillar proteins from surimi after three washing cycles, suggesting that three washing cycles were adequate to prepare surimi. Native-PAGE showed no major changes in surimi after 24 months storage at - 20 °C. SDS-PAGE showed relatively minor changes in protein subunit structure with some loss of the myosin light chains (MLC); myosin heavy chain (MHC), actin and tropomyosin were found to be relatively stable. FTIR/ATR spectroscopy indicated a significant decrease in alpha-helix relative to beta-sheet structure in surimi after 2 years of storage at - 20 °C. The loss of alpha-helical content was more significant in slowly frozen surimi compared to rapid-frozen surimi samples. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to lower temperatures during frozen storage of surimi. Changes in the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet structures suggested that flaxseed protein was the most effective cryoprotectant, followed by whey <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> and <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> for maintaining protein structure stability during frozen storage. Whey protein concentrate and flaxseed meal showed the least cryoprotective ability.

40|$|As {{overweight}} and obesity become {{more prevalent in}} society, the demand for food products that can help maintain body weight increases. One way to make such products is by decreasing the protein and fat content through increasing the water content. This thesis describes the potential of protein microparticles (MPs) to bind ≥  90 % w/w water tightly without negatively influencing sensory perception. Therefore, two types of MPs were prepared: heat- and cold-gelated MPs. In addition, pea <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> lupin protein concentrate and vital wheat gluten particles were used. To determine their water-binding capacity (WBC), pellets were made by centrifuging dispersions of those particles. These measurements showed {{that some of these}} pellets can bind ≥  90 % w/w water. However, the WBC of a pellet contains both water bound within and between the particles, which means that the WBC of a pellet is always unequal to the WBC of the protein particles themselves. To gain more insight in these two water domains and the pellet as a whole, a combination of time domain nuclear magnetic resonance and microscopy was found to be useful. From the measurements, it was concluded that the WBC of a pellet is determined by the structure of protein particles (nanostructure) as well as the structure between particles (microstructure). Overall, the WBC of pellets being larger than that of particles themselves suggests that pellets are a good alternative to the use of MPs for the purpose of increasing the water content of a product, provided they remain a network in the product.  ...|$|R

Overall serum lipid concentrations were greater in rats fed proteins supplemented with methionine while the addition of cystine produced lower lipid levels. Liver lipid concentrations were tremendously increased upon cystine supplementation of <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate.</b> Protein quality, as determined by Protein Efficiency Ratio, was improved by either sulfur-amino acid; however, methionine had the greatest effect. In Study II, ten human adults were fed four laboratory controlled diets containing either <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> alone, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> supplemented with methionine, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> supplemented with cystine, or animal protein. At this level of protein (approximately 16 % of total calories), feeding of animal protein based diets produced lower serum lipids than did the soy based diets. Generally, the addition of methionine to <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> increased blood lipids while cystine supplementation decreased values. Both amino acids improved protein quality as determined by nitrogen balance; however, methionine was more effective. In Study III, a retrospective analysis of the association between animal to vegetable protein intake ratios and serum lipids was performed using adolescent human children as subjects. Negative correlations were found between blood serum lipids and the protein intake ratios. Negative correlations were also found between percent total fat and caloric intakes and serum lipids. These results were not consistent with those obtained from adult populations implying that the physiological demands of growth were probably more influential on serum lipids than were dietary components. ...|$|R
40|$|Background and ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> on prevention of rheumatoid arthritis in collagen-induced rats. MethodsA total of 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats (body weights: 180 - 200 g) were randomly divided into four equal groups including normal; control of rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid arthritis + <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> (7 g/kg); rheumatoid arthritis + dexamethasone (1 mg/kg). Experimentally rheumatoid arthritis in rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of collagen ΙΙ emolsified in Incomplete Frund’s Adjuvant in days 1 and 7. Treatments were gavaged to animals for 30 days, once a day. The severity of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms in paws were daily measured in double blind format by standard method. The statistical comparison between the experimental groups was performed by Independent -samples t- test and One-Way ANOVA using SPSS software. ResultsThe clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis started from day 17. 4 ± 2. 4, 20 ± 4 and 14. 1 ± 1. 9 in <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> dexamethasone and control groups, respectively (P< 0. 05). The severity of clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis on day 30 was 3. 84 ± 2. 04, 2 ± 1. 78 and 6. 5 ± 1. 76 in <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> dexamethasone and control groups, respectively (P< 0. 05). At the end of the study, the incidence rates of rheumatoid arthritis in <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> and control groups was % 83. 33 and % 100, respectively. ConclusionIsolated soy protein decreased the severity of clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, it could be a key factor in prevention and even treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|<b>ISOLATED</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> {{has been}} widely used as a {{vegetable}} protein source for studying zinc metabolism in poultry. A re-lationship between the chick's dietary zinc requirements and phytates has been sug-gested. The zinc content of <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> is very low, {{and its effect on}} the chick's dietary requirement seems to be in increasing the amount of added zinc neces-sary to fulfill this requirement. Sesame meals contain phytic acid but differ from <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in that they contain relatively large amounts of zinc. The avail-ability of zinc from sesame meals varied (Turk and Lease, 1962). Some meals be-haved {{in a manner similar to}} <b>isolated</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in increasing the chick's dietary re-quirement. Sesame meals fell into three classes: (1) those from which zinc is avail-able to the chick, (2) those from which zinc is partly or not available and (3) those from which zinc is not only unavail-able but which have the capacity to bind added zinc and thus increase the chick's dietary zinc requirement. The possibility that other oil seed proteins might also fit into these classes was investigated. The re-lationship between the zinc, magnesium, calcium or phytate content and the clas-sification of an oil seed meal was studied. The deficiency of class 2 meals can be remedied by including the recommended amount of zinc in the mineral mix. Class 3...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{functional}} foods with bioactive components requires component stability in foods and ingredients. Stabilization of sensitive bioactive components {{can be achieved}} by entrapment or encapsulation of these components in solid food matrices. Lactose or trehalose was used as the structure-forming material for the entrapment of hydrophilic ascorbic acid and thiamine hydrochloride or the encapsulation of oil particles containing hydrophobic α-tocopherol. In the delivery of hydrophobic components, milk <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate,</b> or whey protein isolate were used as emulsifiers and, in some cases, applied in excess amount to form matrices together with sugars. Dehydrated amorphous structures with bioactives were produced by freezing and freeze-drying. Experimental results indicated that: (i) lactose and trehalose showed similar water sorption and glass transition but very different crystallization behavior as pure sugars; (ii) the glass transition of sugar-based systems was slightly affected by the presence of other components in anhydrous systems but followed closely that of sugar after water plasticization; (iii) sugar crystallization in mixture systems was composition-dependent; (iv) the stability of bioactives was better retained in the amorphous matrices, although small losses of stability were observed for hydrophilic components above glass transition and for hydrophobic components as a function of water activity; (v) sugar crystallization caused significant loss of hydrophilic bioactives {{as a result of the}} exclusion from the continuous crystalline phase; (vi) loss of hydrophobic bioactives upon sugar crystallization was a result of dramatic change of emulsion properties and the exclusion of oil particles from the protecting structure; (vii) the double layers at the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces improved the stability of hydrophobic bioactives in dehydrated systems. The present study provides information on the physical and chemical stability of sugar-based dehydrated delivery systems, which could be helpful in designing foods and ingredients containing bioactive components with improved storage stability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{experiments}} (EXP) {{were conducted}} to evaluate growth performance of different breed crosses of broiler chicks fed diets containing soybean meal, <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> <b>isolate</b> (SPI), <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> concentrate (SPC), or rice and casein. Cornish × Plymouth Rock (C×PR; EXP 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6) or New Hampshire × Columbian (NH×C; EXP 2 and 4) cross chicks were used. The chicks were fed a corn-soybean meal (C-SBM) diet before allotment to treatment. The age of the chicks ranged from 5 to 9 d posthatching {{at the start of}} the EXP, and the assay periods ranged from 8 to 14 d. Initial weights were 194. 9, 96. 1, 102. 1, 84. 7 [84. 1 (C×PR) or 85. 3 (NH×C) ], 101. 8, and 145. 1 g in EXP 1 to 6, respectively. A completely randomized design was used in all EXP, and treatments were repli-cated four to six times with four or five chicks each. All diets were formulated to meet the NRC nutrient require-ments of chicks. In EXP 1 (C×PR male chicks) and EXP 2 (NH×C female chicks), gain and gain:feed (G:F) were greater (P < 0. 01) in chicks fed the C-SBM diet compared with chicks fed diets containing SPI. In EXP 3, C×PR chicks were fed a C-SBM diet, a SPI-dextrose-cornstarch (Key words: chick, protein source, breed cross...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the involvement of}} myofibrillar proteins in the thermal aggregation of giant squid muscle, and the contribution of some nonmuscle <b>proteins</b> (<b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> casein, and wheat gluten), ι-carrageenan, and starch {{to the formation of}} the gel networks at two salt concentrations (1. 5 % and 2. 5 % NaCl). For this purpose, rheology, selective protein solubility, SDS-PAGE, and microstructural examination were carried out. The low gel-forming capacity of giant squid mantle coincided with the predominance of hydrophobic interactions at high temperature (< 60 °C), mainly involving MHC and paramyosin. The absence of setting coincides with a relatively high incidence of hydrogen bonding at 35 °C. <b>Soy</b> <b>isolate</b> <b>protein</b> and casein showed a great tendency to aggregate by means of hydrophobic interactions when heated. In gels prepared at 90 °C, hydrophobic interactions were more numerous in samples with ingredients than in samples without ingredients; this was reflected by greater work of penetration except in the case of gels containing casein. The low-salt gel with added <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> showed by SDS-PAGE more polymerization of myosin and paramyosin, which was the main cause for its more uniform microstructural appearance and its higher work of penetration.
