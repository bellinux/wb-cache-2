5|$|A {{theory of}} strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} supersymmetry is called a superstring theory. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low <b>energies,</b> the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low <b>energies</b> by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface <b>energies</b> form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are {{constrained}} by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface <b>energies</b> that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher <b>energies.</b> As the LHC operates at higher <b>energies</b> than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low <b>energies</b> (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release <b>energies</b> in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium.

5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} ionization energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon group. This is unusual; ionization <b>energies</b> generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization <b>energies</b> {{is caused by the}} lanthanide contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons. The combined first four ionization <b>energies</b> of lead exceed those of tin, contrary to what periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E

5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital.

5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules {{would have the}} same number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals and would have very low dissociation <b>energies.</b> Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation <b>energies</b> generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of this trend is the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons as well as the relativistically contracted s orbital.
