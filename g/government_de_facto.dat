5|$|Since the 18th century, {{a modern}} system of public {{administration}} {{was going to}} be created in Russia, including the formation of bodies whose powers are similar to the powers of the modern Russian Government. In the period from 1726 to 1905 there was no official title for the leader of the government. The chief ministers (principal ministres) of certain Emperor of Russia nonetheless led the <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto,</b> but de jure the head of government was a monarch.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} did not recognise {{the incorporation}} of Estonia de jure and only recognised its Soviet <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> or not at all. A number of these countries continued to recognize Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned {{in the name of}} their former government. This policy of non-recognition gave rise to the principle of legal continuity, which held that de jure, Estonia remained an independent state under occupation throughout the period 1940–91.|$|E
60|$|In {{this state}} of things, (that is, {{in the case of}} a divided kingdom,) by the law of nations,[30] Great Britain, like every other power, is free to take any part she pleases. She may decline, with more or less formality, {{according}} to her discretion, to acknowledge this new system; or she may recognize it as a <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto,</b> setting aside all discussion of its original legality, and considering the ancient monarchy as at an end. The law of nations leaves our court open to its choice. We have no direction but what is found in the well-understood policy of the king and kingdom.|$|E
60|$|It is, then, plain, by a conduct which overturns a {{thousand}} declarations, {{that we take}} the Royalists of France only {{as an instrument of}} some convenience in a temporary hostility with the Jacobins, but that we regard those atheistic and murderous barbarians as the bonâ fide possessors of the soil of France. It appears, at least, that we consider them as a fair <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto,</b> if not de jure, a resistance to which, in favor of the king of Prance, by any man who happened to be born within that country, might equitably be considered by other nations as the crime of treason.|$|E

60|$|The {{necessity}} {{either of}} raising the quality of representative bodies or of replacing them not only in administration but in legislation by bureaucracies of officials appointed by elected or hereditary rulers, is one that presses on all thoughtful men, and {{is by no means}} an academic question needed to round off this New Republican theory. The necessity becomes more urgent every day, as scientific and economic developments raise first one affair and then another to the level of public or quasi-public functions. In the last century, locomotion, lighting, heating, education, forced themselves upon public control or public management, and now with the development of Trusts a whole host of businesses, that were once the affair of competing private concerns, claim the same attention. Government by hustings' bawling, newspaper clamour, and ward organization, is more perilous every day and more impotent, and unless we are prepared to see a <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> of rich business organizers override the government de jure, or to relapse upon a practical oligarchy of officials, an oligarchy that will certainly decline in efficiency in a generation or so, we must set ourselves most earnestly to this problem of improving representative methods. It is {{in the direction of the}} substitution of the Jury method for a general poll that the only practicable line of improvement known to the present writer seems to lie, and until it has been tried it cannot be conceded that democratic government has been tried and exhaustively proved inadequate to the complex needs of the modern state.|$|E

5|$|John Edward Brownlee {{served as}} Attorney-General of the {{province}} of Alberta in western Canada from 1921 until 1926, in the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) government of Herbert Greenfield. As Brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers, his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney-general, and ranged from providing legal advice to explaining {{how to write a}} business letter; he also became the <b>government's</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> leader in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.|$|R

50|$|Hong Kong Student activist group Scholarism {{began an}} {{occupation}} of the Hong Kong government headquarters on 30 August 2012.

At last, the <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> striked down the Moral and National Education.|$|E

5000|$|Religious {{buildings}} built {{prior to}} 1905 at taxpayers' expense are retained {{by the local}} or national government, and may be used at no expense by religious organizations. As a consequence, most Catholic churches, Protestant temples, and Jewish synagogues are owned by the government. The government, since 1905, has been prohibited from funding any post-1905 religious edifice, and thus religions must build and support all newer religious buildings at their own expense. Some local <b>governments</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> subsidize prayer rooms as part of greater [...] "cultural associations".|$|R

William H. Seward famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under [...] "a higher law than the Constitution." ...|$|E
50|$|Privately owned textile mills found {{themselves}} in a very lucrative market. Ever-rising prices due to scarcity and high-levels of demand made sales to the public far more profitable than fixed-price contract sales to the military. So much so, that in the first year private mills often refused or cut back on fulfillments ordered by Confederate quartermasters. The advent of conscription, giving the <b>government</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> control over the labor force, as well as control over railroads and other forms of transport, precluded such avoidance.|$|E
25|$|First, the Yongying system {{signaled}} {{the end of}} Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as a drain on resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing <b>government's</b> <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> first-line troops. Second, the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders, weakening central government's grip on the whole country. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and cronyism amongst its commanders, who laid the seeds of regional warlordism {{in the first half}} of the 20th century.|$|R
