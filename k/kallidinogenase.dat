40|$|<b>Kallidinogenase</b> {{has been}} used to treat retinal vein {{occlusion}} (RVO) in patients, although there are no evidences on the effects of <b>kallidinogenase</b> on the retinal edema and the non-perfused areas in eyes with a RVO. We have established a murine RVO model with retinal edema and non-perfused areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>kallidinogenase</b> on the retinal edema and size of the non-perfused areas in the mouse RVO model. We evaluated the thickness of the retinal layers and size of the non-perfused areas, and the blood flow by laser speckle flowgraphy in RVO model. The effects of an intravenous injection of <b>kallidinogenase</b> on the retinal edema and size of the non-perfused areas were determined. In addition, the expressions of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were measured by Western blotting. Our results showed that <b>kallidinogenase</b> reduced the degree of retinal edema and size of the non-perfused areas by an increase in the blood flow in RVO model. <b>Kallidinogenase</b> also increased the levels of phosphorylated Akt and eNOS. These findings indicate that <b>kallidinogenase</b> acted through Akt/eNOS-dependent phosphorylation. Thus, <b>kallidinogenase</b> should be considered as a possible therapeutic agent for RVO patients...|$|E
40|$|TKT- 100, a high-unit <b>kallidinogenase</b> preparation, was orally {{given to}} 21 {{patients}} who had male sterility, at the daily dose of 6 tablets for 3 to 4 months. As a result, sperm density was increased in 14 of the patients (66. 7 %), sperm motility was improved in 17 (31. 0 %), and the sperm motility efficiency index (SMEI) was raised in 16 (76. 2 %). A modification of the Eliasson Score was used for bulk measurement of seminal quality. The score was improved in 16 of the patients (76. 2 %). Impregnation was successful in 4 patients (19. 0 %). These results suggest that TKT- 100 is effective for treating substantial male sterility...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of {{edaravone}} combined with urinary <b>kallidinogenase</b> on serum ox-LDL, PCT, hs-CRP, TNF-α and T cell subsets in patients with acute cerebral infarction, so as to explore the mechanisms of combination therapy on patients with acute cerebral infarction. Methods: 86 cases of patients with acute cerebral infarction in our hospital from March 2014 to May 2016 were randomly divided into two groups: control group and observation group, 43 cases in each group. All patients were given general treatment {{according to their own}} specific conditions, including hypoglycemic, pressure adjustment, prevention and treatment of complications, symptomatic support therapy, etc. The control group were given 30 mg Edaravone Injection on this basis with once per day for 14 d; The observation group was treated with 0. 15 PNA urinary <b>kallidinogenase</b> intravenous drip with once per day for 14 d {{on the basis of the}} control group. The levels of serum x-LDL, PCT, hs-CRP, TNF-α and CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 4 +/CD 8 + were detected and compared between the two groups. Results: (1) Before treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups on the levels of serum ox-LDL, PCT, hs-CRP, and TNF-α; after treatment, the serum levels of ox-LDL, PCT, hs-CRP and TNF-α in the two groups were significantly lower than that before treatment, and the difference was significant (P< 0. 05); (2) Before treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups on the levels of serum CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 4 +/CD 8 +; after treatment, the serum levels of CD 3 +, CD 4 + and CD 4 +/CD 8 + were significantly increased in the two groups, and the level of CD 8 + was significantly decreased compared with the same group before treatment, and the difference was significant (P< 0. 05); and the levels of serum CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and CD 4 +/CD 8 + in the observation group were significantly better than those in the control group, and the difference was significant (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The treatment of combined application of urinary <b>kallidinogenase</b> and edaravone in patients with acute cerebral infarction, can significantly improve the serum levels of ox-LDL, PCT, hs-CRP, TNF-α and T cell subsets, further illustrates the synergistic effect of the combination, also shows that the two drugs for acute cerebral infarction can inhibit thrombosis to expand, reduce inflammation, relieve cerebral tissue damage, and improve neurological function...|$|E

This study aimed {{to examine how}} UK affects cognitive status and serum levels of amyloid betas (Aβs) 1 - 40 and 1 - 42 in patients with cerebral arterial stenosis. Methods: Ninety patients with cerebral arterial stenosis were enrolled, of whom 45 patients received UK + conventional treatment (UK group), and 45 patients received conventional treatment alone as control group. Cognitive status and Aβ 1 - 40 and Aβ 1 - 42 serum levels were determined before treatment and at 4  weeks and 8  weeks after treatment. Results: At 4  weeks after treatment, cognitive status in patients treated with UK clearly improved accompanied by Aβ 1 - 40 serum levels decreasing while there was no change of Aβ 1 - 42. Cognitive status in patients receiving UK continued to improve, Aβ 1 - 40 serum levels declined further as well as Aβ 1 - 42 serum levels began to decrease dramatically at 8  weeks after treatment. Conclusion: UK could improve cognitive status and decrease both Aβ 1 - 40 and Aβ 1 - 42 serum levels to prevent ischemic cerebral injury, which represents a good option for patients with cerebral arterial stenosis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the possible mechanism and the neuroprotective effect of human urinary <b>kallidinogenase</b> (HUK) in cerebral ischemia. The mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. Mice were treated with HUK (20 [*]PNAU/g per day, intravenous) or saline as control, from the beginning of reperfusion to 72 [*]h. Neurological deficits, infarct size, and BWC were measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72 [*]h after MCAO, respectively. Pathological changes of brain were observed by TUNEL assay. Inflammatory factors were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting. Activation of MAPKs, Akt, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was detected by western blotting. Our results indicated that HUK significantly improved neurofunction, decreased infarct size, and suppressed edema, as well as inflammatory mediators as compared with the vehicle group. Furthermore, HUK inhibited the NF-κB pathway and activated the MAPK/ERK pathway in this neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesisis a key {{restorative}} {{mechanism in}} response to ischemia, and pro-angiogenic therapy could be beneficial in stroke. Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence suggest that human urinary <b>kallidinogenase</b> (HUK) improves stroke outcome, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The aim of current study was to verify roles of HUK in post-ischemic angiogenesis and identify relevant mediators. In rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we confirmed that HUK treatment could improve stroke outcome, indicated by reduced infarct size and improved neurological function. Notably, the 18 F-FDG micro-PET scan indicated that HUK enhanced cerebral perfusion in rats after MCAO treatment. In addition, HUK promotespost-ischemic angiogenesis, with increased vessel density as well as up-regulated VEGF andapelin/APJ expression in HUK-treated MCAO mice. In endothelial cell cultures, induction of VEGF and apelin/APJ expression, and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation by HUK was further confirmed. These changes were abrogated by U 0126, a selective ERK 1 / 2 inhibitor. Moreover, F 13 A, a competitive antagonist of APJ receptor, significantly suppressed HUK-induced VEGF expression. Furthermore, angiogenic functions of HUK were inhibited {{in the presence of}} selective bradykinin B 1 or B 2 receptor antagonist both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that HUK treatment promotes post-ischemic angiogenesis and cerebral perfusion via activation of bradykinin B 1 and B 2 receptors, which is potentially due to enhancement expression of VEGF and apelin/APJ in ERK 1 / 2 dependent way...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To report our {{findings}} in 2 patients who developed a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and were chronic users of antipsychotic medications. Case Presentation: Case 1 was a 62 -year-old {{woman who had}} a sudden reduction of vision in her right eye to 20 / 2, 000. Her fundus showed signs of an impending CRVO with marked macular edema. She had been taking antipsychotic drugs (quetiapine fumarate and risperidone) for about 2 years. She refused anti-VEGF therapy for her macular edema but selected systemic <b>kallidinogenase.</b> Two days later, the macular edema was significantly reduced {{but the number of}} cotton wool spots (CWS) was increased. Ten days later, the macular edema was resolved and her BCVA improved to 20 / 60. The CWS gradually disappeared, and her BCVA improved to 20 / 20. Case 2 was a 43 -year-old man who presented with vision reduction in his right eye of 1 week’s duration. His BCVA was 20 / 50 and his fundus showed signs of a CRVO-related macular edema with CWS in the peripapillary area. He had been taking sulpiride (DogmatylTM) for depression for 1 year, and his blood test showed an increase in red blood cells and hematocrit. Anti-VEGF therapy was performed, and the macular edema was resolved with vision improving to 20 / 20. There has been no recurrence to date in both cases. Conclusions: These results indicate that a CRVO can be a complication of chronic use of antipsychotic medications. However, early treatment can lead to good outcomes. Clinicians should question patients who develop a sudden CRVO whether they are using antipsychotic medications...|$|E
