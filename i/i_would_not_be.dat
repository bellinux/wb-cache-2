25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

500|$|By January 1915, {{the horrific}} {{nature of the}} war was apparent. Michael felt [...] "greatly embittered towards people in general and most of all towards those who are at the top, who hold power and allow all that horror to happen. If the {{question}} of war were decided by the people at large, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> so passionately averse to that great calamity." [...] Michael confessed {{in a letter to his}} wife that he felt [...] "ashamed to face the people, i.e. the soldiers and officers, particularly when visiting field hospitals, where so much suffering is to be seen, for they might think that one is also responsible, for one is placed so high and yet has failed to prevent all that from happening and protect one's country from this disaster." ...|$|E
500|$|Disraeli toured Belgium and the Rhine Valley {{with his}} father {{in the summer of}} 1824; he later wrote that it was while {{travelling}} on the Rhine that he decided to abandon his position: [...] "I determined when descending those magical waters that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a lawyer." [...] On their return to England he left the solicitors, at the suggestion of Maples, with the aim of qualifying as a barrister. He enrolled as a student at Lincoln's Inn and joined the chambers of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevy, and then those of Benjamin Austen, who persuaded Isaac that Disraeli would never make a barrister and should be allowed to pursue a literary career. He had made a tentative start: in May 1824 he submitted a manuscript to his father's friend, the publisher John Murray, but withdrew it before Murray could decide whether to publish it. Released from the law, Disraeli did some work for Murray, but turned most of his attention not to literature but to speculative dealing on the stock exchange.|$|E
500|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} his eighth studio album, Romance, {{a collection of}} classic boleros, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre {{and was the first}} record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied [...] "I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to [...] "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies;...The creation of an album has to be part of me or else <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to interpret it, or sing in it".|$|E

500|$|But here <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> misunderstood. By {{the love}} of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|A Parisian critic, {{after seeing}} La grand' tante, {{declared}} that Massenet was a symphonist {{rather than a}} theatre composer. At {{the time of the}} British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. [...] Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, [...] "What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> myself." [...] His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. [...] Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.|$|E

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} when Garrow worked as a barrister, the sugar {{planters}} of the West Indies held large amounts of power in Parliament, allowing them to maintain a monopoly on the marketing of sugar in England that brought great profits. This industry was largely profitable due {{to the use of}} slave labour, to which Garrow had long been opposed; when the sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business, he replied that [...] "if your committee would give me their whole incomes, and all their estates, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seen as the advocate of practices which I abhor, and a system which I detest". In 1806 Thomas Picton, the Governor of Trinidad, was charged with a single count of [...] "causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted" [...] on a young free mulatto girl; he was brought before the Court of King's Bench under Lord Ellenborough. The court records run to 367 pages, and Garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel; indeed, his opening speech on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be one of his best. The case centred on whether or not Spanish law, which allowed torture, was still in effect {{at the time of the}} incident. The jury eventually decided that it was not, and Ellenborough found Picton guilty. Picton's counsel requested a retrial, which was granted; the jury in the second trial eventually decided that Picton was innocent.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by Kai Ebel, a German TV reporter, Lewis Hamilton stressed {{that it was}} important to him to [...] "strike back" [...] after his retirement in Singapore. Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: [...] "Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [...] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who have helped me get to where I am today and this team, because without them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> here." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just need to try to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment." [...] Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.|$|E

[...] According to Human Rights Watch, though many civilians in South Lebanon refused to abandon their homes and act on the IDF's warnings, many others were unable to flee due to crumbled infrastructure. Israel singled out much of Lebanese civilian infrastructure for destruction throughout the war {{and at the end}} of the conflict the damage was estimated to top 2.5 billion dollars.|$|E
2500|$|First {{revealed}} by Game Informer in December 2008, the first teaser trailer shows a weary, wounded Drake marching through a snowstorm {{to reach a}} phurba half-buried in the snow.

A second teaser trailer was released soon after, showing a badly wounded Drake stuck in {{the remains of a}} wrecked train hanging precariously over a cliff.
