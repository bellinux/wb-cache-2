An antiserum was raised against the transmembrane protein desmoglein <b>I</b> (<b>DG</b> <b>I)</b> of bovine desmosomes. In extracts of layers of plantar stratum corneum with strong intercellular cohesion, this antiserum reacted with a protein of the same apparent molecular weight as bovine <b>DG</b> <b>I.</b> In dissociated cells this DG I-like protein could not be detected; instead components with molecular weights lower than <b>DG</b> <b>I</b> which reacted with the antiserum were found.
