5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and <b>empirical</b> <b>research,</b> attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould {{published}} a landmark paper developing their theory {{and called it}} punctuated equilibria. Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr's model of geographic speciation, I.

Unlike other studies on the similar topic, this paper focuses on the connections between empirical findings, the way they are interpreted, and the policies that have been recommended. From the review, it can be concluded that despite sound arguments calling for government involvement, more information is needed to determine the appropriate policy to improve the happiness of the society.

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the journal}} shifted towards a {{preference}} for quantitative model building including econometric models and time series models, and accepted more articles by non-accountants who contributed ideas from other disciplines in solving accounting-related problems.

5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} based on the controversies which the {{existing}} <b>empirical</b> <b>researches</b> {{about the impact of the}} basic factors affecting energy efficiency have in index selection and direction, using the method of meta-regression to analyze the related domestic empirical studies comprehensively. We conduct a study on the differences of research design, data characteristics, time span and the index selection, to check whether these differences cause the controversies in index selection and direction. The result shows that the <b>research</b> design, <b>empirical</b> methods, and the characteristics of the selection of indicators have significant impact on the result of <b>empirical</b> <b>researches...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> (the studies that collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> to investigate. Building a reading model based on empirical data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, {{and see how the}} interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further empirical studies. On the other hand, <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> in eye-movements using eye-tracking {{is one of the most}} delicate measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition. Below is a brief summary of these reading models as classified by Nuthmann (2014).|$|E
