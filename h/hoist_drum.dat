Then find the position of the weak section, we calculate the force in each stage of hoisting system and draw force-timing load spectrum,we translate it into stress function of weak link. Based on above studies and conclusion, in line with the materials of the drum and Fatigue characteristic parameters and appropriate fatigue lifetime prediction model, we analysis the fatigue performance, in the end get the distribution of the drum’s fatigue life and the life of plane of weakness...|$|E
50|$|A moving <b>drum</b> <b>hoist,</b> or {{traveling}} <b>drum</b> <b>hoist,</b> is {{a variation}} on the traditional <b>drum</b> <b>hoist.</b> Moving <b>drum</b> <b>hoists</b> effectively eliminate the fleet angle between drum and block by shifting the drum along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per drum revolution is equal to the pitch of the drum's helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving <b>drum</b> <b>hoists</b> can combine <b>drum</b> and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|R

50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} {{helically}} grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable {{in the narrow}} slots. The pile-up <b>drum</b> <b>hoists</b> are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than helically grooved <b>drum</b> <b>hoists,</b> these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up <b>drum</b> <b>hoists</b> can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|R
5000|$|As cranes {{and their}} control systems became more sophisticated, it became {{possible}} {{to control the}} level of luffing directly, by winching the hoist cable in and out as needed. The first of these systems used mechanical clutches between luffing and <b>hoist</b> <b>drums,</b> giving simplicity and a [...] "near level" [...] result.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. <b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because <b>drum</b> <b>hoists</b> do not have tail ropes, the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> take up {{more space}} than a {{friction}} hoist {{for the same}} service as all of the haulage cable must be accommodated on the <b>drum</b> when the <b>hoist</b> is fully raised. <b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> require rapid fluctuations in power demand, which can pose a problem if power is generated on site rather than provided through the main power grid.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in North America, South Africa and South America. When using a <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> the {{hoisting}} cable is wound around the drum when the conveyance is lifted. Single-drum hoists can be used in smaller applications, however double-drum hoists easily allow the hoisting of two conveyances in balance (i.e. one skip being lifted while a second skip is being lowered). [...] <b>Drum</b> <b>hoists</b> are mounted on concrete slabs within a hoistroom, the hoisting ropes run from the drum, up to the top of the headframe, over a sheave wheel and down where they connect to the conveyance (cage or skip).|$|R
50|$|Electro-hydraulic {{equipment}} used in mining operations employ rotary unions including shuttle cars and coal cars, drill heads, backhoes, clam shell cranes and drag lines. In addition, boom <b>hoists,</b> retrieving <b>drums</b> and bucket drum clutches each require rotary unions.|$|R
50|$|As a lift line coils and uncoils {{from the}} drum of a <b>drum</b> <b>hoist,</b> its fleet angle (angle {{of a line}} between drum and sheave) changes. Excessive fleet angles (e.g., greater than 1.5-2.0°) cause {{unpredictable}} line behavior and can damage lines, blocks, and drums. As a result, fleet angles limit how close a dead-haul <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> can be mounted to the head block (usually about 10 feet).|$|R

5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction <b>hoists,</b> unlike <b>drum</b> <b>hoists,</b> can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|R
50|$|A dead-haul <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> {{uses the}} single drum to support all the lift lines {{running from the}} head block of a line set. The lift lines neatly wrap and unwrap in a {{side-by-side}} arrangement on the drum as it is spun by the motor.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising multiple wire strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on <b>hoisting</b> <b>drums</b> to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|R
50|$|Modern headframes {{are built}} out of steel, {{concrete}} {{or a combination of}} both. Timber headframes are no longer used in industrialized countries, but are still used in developing nations. Conventionally steel headframes are used when a <b>drum</b> <b>hoist</b> is employed, and concrete headframes are built for friction hoists; however a steel headframe can be used with a friction hoist for shafts with a smaller capacity and depth.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the surface}} stress {{detection}} {{system of the}} mine <b>hoist</b> machine <b>drum,</b> the wireless sensor nodes placed on the drum need to be powered by a battery. Since the sampling frequency is high and the wireless transmitting and receiving data is enormous, the battery needs to be replaced very frequently.

In this paper, {{the structure of the}} energy harvesting device was introduced, the working principle of wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device on the drum surface of the mine hoist was analyzed, and the piezoelectric bimorph cantilever beam energy harvesting circuit with ultra-low loss characteristics was designed. Based on these, we conducted several experiments with the wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device. The result indicates that the final storage voltage can reach 4. 4 V at both ends of C 3 in the piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit, which means it is able to charge the lithium ion battery.

In 1922 the No. 4 shaft had reached a depth of 2,832 feet and the boundary of the property, mining continued in the No. 4 shaft until 1924. In 1926 the shaft was reopened with the No. 1 shaft to supply the mill with ore. The shaft had reached a depth of 2,832 feet. The shaft would stay open until the mine closed in 1932.|$|R
500|$|The pusher-type {{ammunition}} hoists ran up a {{fixed shaft}} {{in the center}} of the mount. The shells and their powder charges were transferred to a tipping drum that was rotated to match the bearing angle of the guns and then loaded. This system was adapted from that used for the fixed [...] ammunition used in the s. Unfortunately it was not well suited for separate-loading ammunition. Each gun had its own separate shell and powder hoist, for a total of four <b>hoists.</b> The tipping <b>drum</b> had four matching separate trays to move the ammunition to the gun. Each shell was power-rammed, but the propellant charges had to be hand-rammed. Theoretically the guns could be loaded at any angle, but the power rammer was so weak that it could not ram shells at angles above 10°. This problem, coupled with the [...] "poor quality of manufacture of the guns, the unsatisfactory profile of the breech, resulted in a firing cycle of only 3-4 rounds per minute during the early trials with jams and failures frequent", rather than the planned 10 rounds per minute. A further problem was that there only two loaders assigned to the gun crew; they tired quickly during prolonged firing.|$|R
5000|$|No. 1 shaft was {{constructed}} in 1899 {{as one of the}} three original shafts on the property. This shaft is where mohawkite was first found in 1900. [...] In 1902, it was sunk down to the 8th level, with a depth of 800 feet. In 1904 shafts No. 1, 2, and 4 were equipped with Nordberg Conical <b>Drum</b> <b>Hoists,</b> which would be good up to 6000 feet. In 1906, the No. 1 shaft was extended to a depth of 1,400 feet. In 1908, it had reached a depth of 1,700 feet. After the strike in 1913, the No. 1 shaft was worked with only one 8 hour a day shift, producing 300 tons of ore per day. By 1916, the No. 1 shaft had reached a depth of 2,693 feet and had exhausted the ore deposits, which caused work in the shaft to be discontinued. In 1918 the value of copper increased, which provided extra money to resume mining in the No. 1 shaft. The shaft was mined until June 1922 because the copper content was only 4 to 5 pounds of copper per ton of rock. When the shaft closed it had reached a depth of 2,896 feet on the 26th level. In 1926 the shaft was reopened with the No. 4 shaft to supply the mill with ore. The shaft had reached a depth of 3,017 feet, making it the deepest of all the Mohawk Mining shafts. The shaft would become permanently closed, along with the mine, in 1932.|$|R
