5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His involvement in this conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to be taken up again.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> entries out in western territories.

5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E
