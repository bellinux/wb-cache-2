5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E

500|$|In the {{concluding}} statements, one prosecuting attorney {{said that what}} Till <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice and mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night Till was murdered were improbable, and said the jury's [...] "forefathers would turn over in their graves" [...] if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned) acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, [...] "If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long." ...|$|E

Hastert said he did not remember abusing Cross, [...] "but I accept his statement." [...] Hastert stated [...] "what I <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and I regret it ... I took advantage of them." [...] Hastert also acknowledged that he had misled the FBI. Judge Durkin referred to Hastert as a [...] "serial child molester" [...] and imposed a sentence of fifteen months in prison, two years' supervised release, including sex-offender treatment, and a $250,000 fine. [...] Hastert is [...] "one of the highest-ranking politicians in American history to be sentenced to prison." ...|$|E
2500|$|At work, Ambrose again serves Dan, {{who had an}} {{argument}} with Nicola whilst viewing another flat. It now transpires that Dan {{used to have a}} promising career in the Army, but was dismissed after the men he was responsible for committed some undisclosed atrocity. Although Dan accepts that what his men <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and, as the only officer present, he should carry the can, he appears to be in denial about his share of the responsibility. [...] Vaguely referring to a past relationship, Ambrose suggests that the solution may be for Dan to, at least temporarily, meet other women. Dan returns home drunk again, and this time, the row escalates and Dan mentions they break up for a while, exactly how Ambrose suggested. Feigning indifference, Nicola accepts, saying she may also meet someone else.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} debated by many critics and {{scholars}} {{whether or not}} sonnet 110 was written about Shakespeare's career in the theater or if the sonnet is a confession of love to a young man. The lines in the sonnet {{could be related to}} the stage but scholars Virginia L. Radley and David C. Redding disagree stating that sonnet 110 is, [...] "addressed to an old friend of the poet's." [...] Sonnet 110 can be interpreted as a confession of love and the mistakes the poet made when he decided to leave his original love. The poet confesses to the young man his infidelities and regrets in order to receive pity from the young man for what the poet <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> but should be forgiven since he claimed the young man is the best person he will ever love.|$|E
2500|$|Seldes {{had both}} staunch admirers and strong critics. Some {{of his contemporaries}} and later historians have judged much of his work harshly. One critic thought I. F. Stone [...] "was light years beyond Seldes." [...] Others cited his {{political}} bias and preconceptions. A study of the Dies Committee said that Seldes's account in Witch Hunt suffered from his view that everything the Committee <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Another warned that The Catholic Crisis [...] "should be read with great caution {{in view of the}} author's latent anti-Catholic and pro-Communist bias." [...] Another cited Seldes as a writer with [...] "an agenda." [...] Still another evaluated Iron, Blood, and Profits as [...] "less sober" [...] than other works on the subject of international arms dealing. Of his biography of Mussolini, another wrote: [...] "many of his sources were unreliable and his book was almost devoid of logical order." [...] A more appreciative assessment said Freedom of the Press was [...] "one-sided, but well deserves careful reading." [...] Summing up Seldes's work, another wrote that [...] "until 1947 [...] followed the Stalinist line so closely that any author must use him with the utmost care." ...|$|E

60|$|The hero-worship was {{conveniently}} forgotten, {{and none}} strove {{to conceal the}} dislike, even the contempt, which he felt for the fallen idol.

60|$|The {{question}} of his relation to Alice was not so easily settled. She had come to irritate him now. Her changeable, swift-witted, moody, hysterical invalidism had begun to wear upon him intolerably. Everything she <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was brutal even to admit this, but {{he could no longer}} conceal it either from himself or from her. It was deeply, sadly painful to recall the promise, the complete confidence and happiness with which they had both started towards the West. How sure of her recovery they had been, how gay and confident of purpose! Now she not only refused to listen to his demand for an early marriage, but hampered and annoyed him in a hundred ways. As he walked the silent night he was forced to acknowledge that she had been right in delaying their union. And yet how dependent upon him she was. Her life was so tragically inwound with his that to think of shaking away her hand seemed the act of a sordid egoist.|$|E

Of course, all my friends and relatives prophesied failure.

[...] She indicated shelves of farm books and files of farm magazines that lined the walls. [...] "And I continued to study. I was resolved {{to be up to}} date, and I sent for all the experiment station reports. I went almost entirely on the basis that whatever the old type farmer <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> and, do you know, in doing that I was not so far wrong myself. It's almost unthinkable, the stupidity of the old-fashioned farmers.
