The standard Airtraq is a <b>disposable</b> <b>article</b> with an eyepiece optic, while the AirtraqAvant allows re-use of the optical system as well as external video monitoring and recording. The Airtraq blade is anatomically formed, with a battery-powered light source {{at the tip of}} the blade. The battery power reserve is sufficient to power the bulb for 90 minutes, according to the product information. The light bulb is designed to reach an operating temperature of 40 °C in order to suppress fogging of the optical system. The visual image is transmitted from a lens at the distal tip of the blade to the optical eyepiece (or monitor) via a series of prisms and mirrors. Apart from the integrated optical system, the handle and blade of the Airtraq laryngoscope also contain a channel for the placement and insertion of the endotracheal tube.|$|E

The boy Mohammed having laid in a large store of grain, purchased with my money, having secured all my <b>disposable</b> <b>articles,</b> and having hinted that, after my return to India, a present of twenty dollars would find him at Meccah, asked leave, and departed with a coolness for which I could not account. Some days afterwards Shaykh Nur explained the cause. I had taken the youth with me on board the steamer, where a bad suspicion crossed his mind. “Now, I understand,” said the boy Mohammed to his fellow-servant, “your master is a Sahib from India; he hath laughed at our beards.” ...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} {{are used}} in an increasingly large number of mass produced applications such as packaging, paper coating, fibers, films, and other <b>disposable</b> <b>articles,</b> {{as well as in}} biomedical applications such as resorbable surgical sutures, implants, and controlled drug delivery devices. Particularly in the packaging sector, the raw materials should be annually renewable and the end products should be compostable to reduce the use of fossil resources. Furthermore, the production processes on an industrial scale should be efficient, environmentally friendly and economically competitive. Among possible monomers, lactic acid (2 -hydroxy propionic acid), which is a non-toxic, naturally occurring, and renewable raw material, fulfills most of these rigorous requirements. Pure L- and D-lactic acid can be obtained by fermentation or culture techniques, whereas synthetic lactic acid is a racemic mixture, referred to as DL-lactic acid. There has been a continued interest in more efficient process for fermentation production of lactic acid, its recovery and purification. The traditional recovery process of lactic acid from fermentation broth is quite complicated. Reactive extraction with a specified extractant has been proposed as a promising technique for the recovery of lactic acid. Lactic acid based polyesters are well known and widely studied biodegradable polymers. Poly(lactic acid), a thermoplastic polyester, is suitable for packaging applications, since PLA’s glass transition temperature (Tg about 60 °C) is above the service temperature. The existence of both a hydroxyl and a carboxyl group in lactic acid enables it to b...|$|R
40|$|Cost-effective {{microporous}} {{films and}} composites {{can be made}} by using polyolefinic material and inorganic fillers. These microporous films and their composites can be designed and manufactured at high speed using commercial equipment for <b>disposable</b> hygiene <b>articles,</b> protective health care garments, building construction and many other industrial applications where air and moisture breathability is needed. The theory, formulations and methods of making these cost-effective polyolefinic-calcium carbonate compositions are discussed. Special engineering fibers and their fabrics can be combined with these novel microporous films to achieve a variety of properties for practical applications. However, one should keep intellectual property considerations in mind when contemplating the manufacture of microporous film products, their companies and their applications...|$|R
40|$|WO 2003087191 A UPAB: 20040302 NOVELTY - A {{method for}} the {{production}} of homo- or co-polyesters by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic monomers in presence of tin-based initiators and optionally Sub-Group IV metal compounds involves adding phosphinic acid and/or phosphine derivatives to the mixture up to {{the point at which the}} required degree of polymerization is reached. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A method {{for the production}} of homo- or co-polyesters from cyclic monomers by polymerization in presence of tin(II) - or tin(IV) -based initiators (organotin compounds, tin carboxylates or tin alkoxides; optionally containing hydroxyl groups) and optionally in presence of organo-soluble Sub-Group IV metal compounds (especially titanium and/or zirconium compounds), in which a phosphinic acid and/or phosphine derivative of formula (I) is added to the mixture up to the time at which the required degree of polymerization is reached. (R 1) (R 2) P(O) X (I) R 1, R 2 = H, alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl; X = OR 3 or NR 1 R 2; R 3 = H, alkyl, aryl, MI or 1 / 2 MII; MI = an alkali metal; MII = an alkaline earth metal. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for stabilizing (co) polyester melts obtained from cyclic monomers as above by adding (I) to the melt. USE - Polyesters obtained by this method (e. g. homo- and co-polyesters of L- or DL-lactic acid) are used as biodegradable thermoplastics, e. g. in packaging materials, hygiene products, <b>disposable</b> <b>articles,</b> implants and other medical applications. ADVANTAGE - The addition of certain phosphinic acid derivatives as melt stabilizers during ring-opening polymerization reactions prevents depolymerization and reformation of the original monomers...|$|R

40|$|This study, is {{a result}} of a {{collaboration}} between Uddevalla hospital, Västra Götalandsregionen, and Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose of the study is to designing a new materials supply process of surgical material for the operation clinic at Uddevalla hospital which enables for decreased changeover time between surgeries. The study is conducted at Uddevalla hospital, a hospital which provides elective patient care. The flow of surgical material towards the part of the operation clinic that performs hip surgery is investigated. In order to map out the flow of surgical material towards the operation clinic, the project team follows the material from contamination during surgery, to it being back in the operation clinic storage, sterilised and packed. Data is collected through literature search, and a combination of structured observations and semi-structured interviews at Uddevalla hospital, NÄL hospital, and Mölndal hospital. During the data collection and the description of the current situation at Uddevalla hospital, it is made clear that material handling activities take place at the operation clinic which could be performed elsewhere by other personnel. Further, handling of separate <b>disposable</b> <b>articles</b> is identified as time consuming, and the operation table setting is appointed as the activity that effect the changeover time the most. A new materials supply process is suggested in which the activities operation cart packing and disinfection are externalised from the changeover process at the operation clinic to the central sterilisation department. Further, the project team recommends the introduction of operation table setting rooms. The project team also suggests the introduction of procedure packs, which are packages in which all disposable material needed for a type of surgery are combined in a single package. The new materials supply process, through externalisation of material handling activities, freesup time for the operation clinic personnel, and enables for more patient care, hence reduced changeover time between surgeries. The operation table setting rooms allow the operation table setting to be performed during ongoing surgery. The procedure packs simplify the cart packing by reducing the number of articles to collect, and they speed-up the operation table setting since fewer packages have to be opened. The externalisation of the disinfection process and the operation cart packing require a new ITsystem in which orders can be placed and information sharing between the central sterilisation department and the operation clinic is enabled. To further improve the communication between the two units, it would be beneficial if they could be located on the same floor, which requires a new operation building...|$|R
40|$|The first {{electrochemical}} immunosensor for {{the determination}} of 8 -isoprostane (8 -iso prostaglandin F 2 α, ISO), {{one of the most}} reliable biomarkers of lipid peroxidation in the human body and of aging related to Alzheimer´s disease or atherosclerosis is reported in this <b>article.</b> <b>Disposable</b> screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with carboxylated carbon nanohorns (CNHs) were employed as scaffolds for covalent immobilization of a specific anti-ISO antibody). A competitive immunoassay involving ISO and HRPlabeled antigen was designed and {{the determination of}} ISO was carried out by amperometry at - 200 mV using the H 2 O 2 /hydroquinone (HQ) system. Under the optimized conditions, the immunosensor provides a linear response for ISO (r 2 = 0. 998) extending up to 700 pg/mL, which is suitable for the determination of the target compound in human serum. The analytical performance of the immunosensor improves that claimed for ELISA kits in terms of linearity of the calibration plot, precision, with RSD values lower than 1 %, and assay time (1 h 30 min), and exhibits a low limit of detection, 12 pg/mL, a long storage stability (30 days), and an excellent selectivity against other proteins that may be found in human serum. The analytical utility of the developed immunosensor was demonstrated by determining ISO in two types of human serum samples: lyophilized spiked serum, and real human serum from healthy male and female individuals with good results...|$|R
40|$|Medical Devices [MD] {{represent}} special {{challenges to}} the designer and manufacturer. They range from <b>disposable,</b> single use <b>articles</b> to extremely complex and expensive technologies. While single use devices may be simple in concept and easily manufactured, they nevertheless may be invasive or could threaten human life if inappropriately used. For consumables packaging to maintain sterility from factory output to the operating tray is an important requirement. Such devices, in common with far more sophisticated equipment, may be assigned a classification requiring tightly controlled manufacturing and inspection systems that may vary between different jurisdictions. Quality management systems increase overheads to the already considerable investment incurred during R & D. Audit trails required by these systems become tortuous and difficult to validate as components are sourced increasingly from low cost base countries. The increasing use of microprocessor controlled wireless network technology increases radio frequency clutter and electromagnetic interference between medical devices can result in injury or death. Most countries now insist on guarantees that toxic substances cannot be released by a product into the environment during it's lifecycle or when disposed of. International protection of intellectual property presents challenges for New Zealand manufacturers with limited resources. Frequently the designer/manufacturer needs an in depth understanding of the clinical context for the equipment including a knowledge of human physiology and anatomy for the application. Current literature about allied technology must be reviewed and a business plan developed that exploits the opportunity presented by the proposed advances {{in the development of}} a new MD applying current theoretical knowledge. Many developments supercede historical technology, introducing challenges for the practitioner/operator to understand it's operation and optimise it's performance. Factoring patient & practitioner education into the distribution of MD's significantly increases the cost of marketing. To gain access into international markets MD's must comply with stringent standards for safety and performance. A case study examines these issues in relation to the development by the author of MD's to enhance vision and conduct tests of visual performance, the Librus 300 & 600. This study illustrates many of the difficulties the New Zealand Manufacturer faces and suggests management structures, processes and development systems that would facilitiate the process and an infrastructure to support it...|$|R
