5|$|Martin and Halcli waived {{their rights}} to the Article 32 hearing, meaning that their cases could move {{immediately}} to court-martial or administrative action. Wickson was given immunity by USAF Lieutenant General Eugene Santarelli, commander of the 17th Air Force, to testify at the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma was an open <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the 8th Air Force. May's hearing, beginning on 7 November 1994 at Sembach Air Base, Germany was a closed <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests to testify at either hearing.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments {{within the}} FBI and the Marine Corps, {{as well as}} nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics. He received awards for his marksmanship {{until the age of}} 90 and served as the coach of the Olympic shooting team until 2000. At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> memory loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E

The Judicial Committee consists of senior judges appointed as Privy Counsellors: predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth. The Privy Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire (other than for the United Kingdom itself), and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, and some independent Commonwealth states.|$|E
5|$|Denver is a {{consolidated}} city-county with a mayor elected on {{a nonpartisan}} ballot, a 13-member city council and an auditor. The Denver City Council is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and {{is responsible for}} passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public <b>hearing,</b> <b>and</b> can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is Michael Hancock.|$|E

Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Morrison notched two assists during the series. After initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks in the off-season, Morrison filed for arbitration. He won his <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> was awarded a two-year, US$4.6 million contract on August 3, 2002, more than doubling his previous year's salary of US$775,000.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>and</b> balance {{are both}} {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1993 {{creation}} of the National Native Title Tribunal, there have been four separate claims to Native Title lodged over alienated lands in the ACT by representatives of the Ngunnawal communities, in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. The first two of these were discontinued after reaching a Federal Court <b>hearing,</b> <b>and</b> the third was rejected as not meeting applicable provisions. The fourth claim was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The {{nose of the}} bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of a week or so, devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E

He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.|$|E

Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first <b>hearing,</b> <b>and</b> he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
