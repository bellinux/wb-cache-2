25|$|As {{mentioned}} in the introduction, the rules allow one to deduce different types for {{one and the same}} expression. See for instance, Example 2, steps 1,2 and <b>Example</b> <b>3,</b> steps 2,3 for three different typings of the same expression. Clearly, the different results are not fully unrelated, but connected by the type order. It is an important property of the rule system and this order that whenever more than one type can be deduced for an expression, among them is (modulo alpha-renaming of the type variables) a unique most general type in the sense, that all others are specialization of it. Though the rule system must allow to derive specialized types, a type inference algorithm should deliver this most general or principal type as its result.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as making}} use of non-retrogradable rhythm and the Hindu decî-tâlas, Messiaen also {{composed}} with [...] "additive" [...] rhythms. This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm (see <b>Example</b> <b>3),</b> or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration (adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its repeat, for example). This led Messiaen to use rhythmic cells that irregularly alternate between two and three units, a process that also occurs in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which Messiaen admired.|$|E
500|$|Messiaen {{had a great}} {{admiration for}} the music of Igor Stravinsky, {{particularly}} the use of rhythm in earlier works such as The Rite of Spring, and his use of colour. He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of Heitor Villa-Lobos, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there. Among composers for the keyboard, Messiaen singled out Jean-Philippe Rameau, Domenico Scarlatti, Frédéric Chopin, Debussy and Isaac Albéniz. He loved the music of Modest Mussorgsky and incorporated varied modifications {{of what he called}} the [...] "M-shaped" [...] melodic motif from Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, although he modified the final interval in this motif from a perfect fourth to a tritone (<b>Example</b> <b>3).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{completion}} of the sale, the investor typically has a limited time (for <b>example,</b> <b>3</b> days in the US) to borrow the shares. [...] If required by law, the investor first ensures that cash or equity is on deposit with his brokerage firm as collateral for the initial short margin requirement. [...] Some short sellers, mainly firms and hedge funds, participate {{in the practice of}} naked short selling, where the shorted shares are not borrowed or delivered.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Example</b> <b>3.</b> The [...] {{power set}} algebra, the set 2W of all subsets {{of a given}} set W. This is just Example 2 in disguise, with W serving to index the bit {{positions}}. Any subset X of W {{can be viewed as}} the bit vector having 1's in just those bit positions indexed by elements of X. Thus the all-zero vector is the empty subset of W while the all-ones vector is W itself, these being the constants 0 and 1 respectively of the power set algebra. The counterpart of disjunction x∨y is union X∪Y, while that of conjunction x∧y is intersection X∩Y. Negation ¬x becomes ~X, complement relative to W. There is also set difference X∖Y= X∩~Y, symmetric difference (X∖Y)∪(Y∖X), ternary union X∪Y∪Z, and so on. The atoms here are the singletons, those subsets with exactly one element.|$|E
2500|$|All {{examples}} {{above are}} either commutative (i.e. the multiplication is commutative) or co-commutative (i.e. Δ = T ∘ Δ where the twist map T: H ⊗ H → H ⊗ H {{is defined by}} T(x ⊗ y) = y ⊗ x). Other interesting Hopf algebras are certain [...] "deformations" [...] or [...] "quantizations" [...] of those from <b>example</b> <b>3</b> which are neither commutative nor co-commutative. These Hopf algebras are often called quantum groups, a term that is so far only loosely defined. They are important in noncommutative geometry, the idea being the following: a standard algebraic group is well described by its standard Hopf algebra of regular functions; we can then think of the deformed version of this Hopf algebra as describing a certain [...] "non-standard" [...] or [...] "quantized" [...] algebraic group (which is not an algebraic group at all). While there {{does not seem to}} be a direct way to define or manipulate these non-standard objects, one can still work with their Hopf algebras, and indeed one identifies them with their Hopf algebras. Hence the name [...] "quantum group".|$|E

6000|$|... § XXXI. The {{advance of}} the Gothic spirit was, for a few years, checked by this {{compromise}} between the round and pointed arch. The truce, however, was at last broken, in consequence of the discovery that the keystone would do duty quite {{as well in the}} form b as in the form a, Fig. XXX., and the substitution of b, {{at the head of the}} arch, gives us the window of the third order, 3 b, 3 d, and 3 e, in Plate XIV. The forms 3 a and 3 c are exceptional; the first occurring, as we have seen, in the Corte del Remer, and in one other palace on the Grand Canal, close to the Church of St. Eustachio; the second only, as far as I know, in one house on the Canna-Reggio, belonging to the true Gothic period. The other three examples, 3 b, 3 d, 3 e, are generally characteristic of the third order; and it will be observed that they differ not merely in mouldings, but in slope of sides, and this latter difference is by far the most material. For in the <b>example</b> <b>3</b> b there is hardly any true Gothic expression; it is still the pure Byzantine arch, with a point thrust up through it: but the moment the flanks slope, as in 3 d, the Gothic expression is definite, and the entire school of the architecture is changed.|$|E

40|$|The {{two-fold}} aim of {{the paper}} is to unify and generalize {{on the one hand}} the double integrals of Beukers for ζ(2) and ζ(3), and those of the second author for Euler's constant γ and its alternating analog (4 /π), {{and on the other hand}} the infinite products of the first author for e, and of the second author for π and e^γ. We obtain new double integral and infinite product representations of many classical constants, as well as a generalization to Lerch's transcendent of Hadjicostas's double integral formula for the Riemann zeta function, and logarithmic series for the digamma and Euler beta functions. The main tools are analytic continuations of Lerch's function, including Hasse's series. We also use Ramanujan's polylogarithm formula for the sum of a particular series involving harmonic numbers, and his relations between certain dilogarithm values.
