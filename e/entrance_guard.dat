50|$|The Class 1 path {{begins on}} a very long uphill stretch, {{followed}} by a long pleasant downhill ride through a pretty canyon area, part of an affluent land development named Shady Canyon. Ultimately the path leads to an <b>entrance</b> <b>guard</b> house, and continues to the left on a section of Class I path (not documented here). Taking the sidewalk {{to the right of}} the guard house leads back to surface roads. Taking the first right on Sunnyhill (Road?) leads to a crossing into a small park, where there is a sidewalk / bike path that heads back uphill. This ends on a downhill street which leads to an intersection. Turning left at the intersection and using the sidewalk, which doubles as a bike path, leads downhill to the entrance to another Class 1 bike path, which snakes downhill on a narrow greenway passing under streets in special tunnels, reminiscent of a roller coaster ride. Caution is warranted, as this is in a residential section and there are pedestrians. Riders may also find it helpful to carry a map of this section of Irvine, since there is no signage for this part of the path and the first gap in the greenway can be confusing.|$|E
50|$|Fork Castle locates on {{the north}} side Fork Village at an {{altitude}} of 1840 meters on the edge of heights of Darmian Valley leading to Asadiyeh plain. In view of location, it has a good strategic situation, because it has a view of the entire village, farms and roads around its eastern region. The area of the Castle is about 9200 square meters which extends from east to west. The main entrance of the castle is located within the eastern walls, which is also the lowest point of the castle. In general, in the architecture of the castle from the east to the west, three major parts are recognizable. The first part on the east includes a barn, living place of crew, place of keeping cattle and dock warehouse. The second part of the castle, which is {{in the center of the}} castle, is located on a higher altitude than the first part and has been constructed at a distance of 50 meters from the place of food and military supplies and place of residing soldiers, and the third part which has the centrality state of the castle has been built in the highest part of the castle on two floors overlooking the entire village and the roads the area. In the eastern part of the castle including <b>entrance,</b> <b>guard</b> towers, water storage and other spaces, it is impossible to discern the purpose of their construction, owing to high rate of their destruction. Due to existence of the remnants of tower and rampart in the middle of the section with the first part, it is likely that this part was the second defensive phase of the castle, so that the defensive layers of the main part of the castle, i.e. Kohandej, is more completed. There is a brick tower with cruciform or lozenge design decorations in the northeast corner of this part which is known as penthouse tower among the people of the village. The third part of the castle located in the utmost west and the highest part of the castle is separated from the second part by two towers and fortified and long walls. The existence of these towers and ramparts shows the great importance of this part. This part is considered as the alcove of castle has more untouched spaces than the previous two parts. The existence of spaces like the vestibule, connecting corridors, stables, food storage, watchtowers and spaces with other applications are the most important specifications of this part; Alcove or citadel consists of two floors of which the upper floor, except the limited area, have been destroyed. The other architectural element is a burrow that has an exit door, and which has been designed for water supply during castle siege or for emergency and clandestine exit.|$|E

40|$|In recognition, discriminators use sensory {{information}} to make decisions. For example, honeybee (Apis mellifera) <b>entrance</b> <b>guards</b> discriminate between nest-mates and intruders by comparing their odours with a template of the colony odour. Comb wax {{plays a major role}} in honeybee recognition. We measured the rejection rates of nest-mate and non-nest-mate worker bees by <b>entrance</b> <b>guards</b> before and after a unidirectional transfer of wax comb from a `comb donor¿ hive to a `comb receiver¿ hive. Our results showed a significant effect that occurred in one direction. Guards in the comb receiver hive became more accepting of non-nest-mates from the comb donor hive (rejection decreased from 70 to 47 %); however, guards in the comb donor hive did not become more accepting of bees from the comb receiver hive. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the transfer of wax comb increases the acceptance of non-nest-mates not by changing the odour of the bees, but by changing the template used by guards...|$|R
40|$|Honey bee (Apis mellifera) <b>entrance</b> <b>guards</b> {{discriminate}} nestmates from intruders. We {{tested the}} hypothesis that the recognition cues between nestmate bees and intruder bees overlap by comparing their acceptances with that of worker common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, by <b>entrance</b> <b>guards.</b> If recognition cues of nestmate and non-nestmate bees overlap, we would expect recognition errors. Conversely, we hypothesised that guards would not make errors in recognizing wasps because wasps and bees should have distinct, non-overlapping cues. We found both to be true. There was a negative correlation between errors in recognizing nestmates (error: reject nestmate) and nonnestmates (error: accept non-nestmate) bees such that when guards were likely to reject nestmates, they were less likely to accept a nonnestmate; conversely, when guards were likely to accept a non-nestmate, they were less likely to reject a nestmate. There was, however, no correlation between errors in the recognition of nestmate bees (error: reject nestmate) and wasps (error: accept wasp), demonstrating that guards were able to reject wasps categorically. Our results strongly support that overlapping cue distributions occur, resulting in errors and leading to adaptive shifts in guard acceptance thresholds...|$|R

Owing to their low cost, an ocean of IWC devices has been placed in indoor environment to supply context-awareness service for the target. Various positioning systems have also been proposed and unfolded satisfactory performance [16 – 20]. Meanwhile, thanks to the continual miniaturization of the microelectronic technology, cutting-edge cell phones equipped with IWC modules have been committed to remote control, intelligent <b>entrance</b> <b>guard,</b> instant payment, and tag identification via the connection with surrounding IWC devices. In this situation, if we regard {{all or part of}} the surrounding IWC devices that could provide spatial characteristic about the cell phone as cooperative partners, a cooperative localization system on the basis of traditional CPS or GPS can be established, which is reasonable to expect a higher location precision and a better stability [21 – 23].|$|E
