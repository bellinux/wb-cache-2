500|$|The {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing flaps and ailerons {{on one side and}} lowering them on the other provided roll. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. [...] Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing <b>flaps</b> <b>down</b> and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. [...] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of [...] "commercial off-the-shelf" [...] components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|E

2500|$|Stalling speeds {{were quite}} low. The typical Typhoon trait, {{as with most}} {{aircraft}} at the time, was to drop a wing sharply with flaps either up or down. The stalling speeds varied. The various loads depended on external fittings. All-up weight plus two [...] bombs (12,155lb in total) with flaps up could induce a stall at 90–100mph. With <b>flaps</b> <b>down,</b> stall was initiated at 70–75mph. Normal all-up weight (11,120lb) would see stall at 80–90 and 65–70mph respectively. With all ammunition and nearly all fuel expended (9,600lb) stall occurred at 75–80 and 65–70mph.|$|E
2500|$|After {{its first}} flight, the Curlew {{successfully}} completed its initial trials, {{which include a}} terminal velocity dive at 305mph (491km/h) and a maximum loaded weight producing a wing loading of 14lb/sq ft (68kg/m2). [...] Landing speed with <b>flaps</b> <b>down</b> was 38mph (61km/h). [...] The machine was advertised as suitable for other engines up to powers of 130hp (97kW) and the de Havilland Gipsy Major was specifically mentioned. [...] Though Cole had by this time withdrawn his financial support, things {{for a short while}} looked bright for CLW, with talk of an Australian order for 50 Curlews, but they were over extended and went bankrupt. [...] The sole Curlew, registered G-ADYU and built at a cost of £10,000 went to Essex Aero Ltd, also of Gravesend, in the asset sale. [...] It then went to Martlesham Heath and gained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 19 November 1936. It seems to have done little flying after that. [...] Stored during the war, it was broken up in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Some Me 262s were {{destroyed}} using a tactic known to 135 Wing as the [...] "Rat Scramble"; Tempests on immediate alert took off when an Me 262 {{was reported to}} be airborne. They did not directly intercept the jet, but instead flew towards the Me 262 and Ar 234 base at Rheine-Hopsten. The aim was to attack jets on their landing approach, when they were at their most vulnerable, travelling slowly, with <b>flaps</b> <b>down</b> and incapable of rapid acceleration. The Germans responded by creating a [...] "flak lane" [...] of over 150 of the dreaded Flakvierling [...] "quadmount" [...] 20mm (.79in) AA batteries at Rheine-Hopsten, to protect the approaches.

2500|$|The British Hawker Tempest {{scored a}} number of kills against the new German jets, {{including}} the Messerschmitt Me 262. Hubert Lange, a Me 262 pilot, said: [...] "the Messerschmitt Me 262's most dangerous opponent was the British Hawker Tempest—extremely fast at low altitudes, highly manoeuvrable and heavily armed." [...] Some were destroyed with a tactic known to the Tempest 135 Wing as the [...] "Rat Scramble": Tempests on immediate alert took off when an Me 262 was reported airborne.

2500|$|The plane {{suddenly}} {{shook and}} its airspeed dropped precipitously. The left wing dropped {{and the plane}} began {{to turn to the}} left. Flight Engineer Forbes noted that the fuel flow meter was not indicating any flow to the No. 4 engine. Captain Claude quickly applied full throttle and ordered Forbes to apply the booster pump, which increases the fuel flow to the engines in emergencies. The captain applied full right aileron in an attempt to raise the dropping left wing, and ordered First Officer Lewis to raise the flaps and landing gear, intending to circle the airport and attempt another landing (known as a go-around). Lewis raised the landing gear but did not raise the flaps, stating later that he “was afraid” to raise them because he assumed that the airplane would immediately stall if he complied. [...] Lewis noticed that the No. 4 engine’s fuel pressure was zero and its RPM was dropping, and he feathered the prop, hoping that the resulting reduction in drag would help the airplane accelerate and climb. However, with the <b>flaps</b> <b>down</b> and only two of the four engines working, the DC-6 did not accelerate; it continued to drop, headed on a path crossing Runway 36 approximately 40 degrees to the left. The captain raised the airplane's nose in a futile attempt to climb, but the airliner stalled instead, striking the runway tail-first.|$|E
60|$|Towards {{three in}} the morning all things are settled: the watches set, the Centre Grenadiers put into their old Guard-room, and harangued; the Swiss, and few {{remaining}} Bodyguards harangued. The wayworn Paris Batallions, consigned to 'the hospitality of Versailles,' lie dormant in spare-beds, spare-barracks, coffeehouses, empty churches. A troop of them, {{on their way to the}} Church of Saint-Louis, awoke poor Weber, dreaming troublous, in the Rue Sartory.

You see, for one thing, at once, {{how strong}} the fleur-de-lys leaf is, {{and that it}} is just twice as strong as a blade of grass, for it is the {{substance}} of the staff, with its sides flattened together, while the grass blade is a staff cut {163} open and flattened out.

And you see, with its keen edge, and long curve, and sharp point, how like a sword it is. The botanists would for once have given a really good and right name to the plants which have this kind of leaf, 'Ensatæ,' from the Latin 'ensis,' a sword; if only sata had been properly formed from sis. We can't let the rude Latin stand, but you may remember that the fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry, has a sword for its leaf, and a lily for its heart.|$|E
60|$|He sat {{upon the}} padded locker, wrapped about very carefully, for the air, though calm, was exhilaratingly cold and clear.

Over his head was a tow wig, surmounted by a large cap of Mr. Butteridge's with the <b>flaps</b> <b>down</b> over his ears. And some fur sleeping-boots of Mr. Butteridge's warmed his feet.

His face was brown-red, with a dry, bright skin, that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions. His eyes were arresting--brown, full, like a rabbit's, or like a troll's, or like the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of knowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with his watchful dark eyes, but entering into no relation with her. He had made her feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to him. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try it at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said, nevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the stability and control characteristics of a 1 / 10 -scale model of a Canadian tailless glider has been conducted in the 10 Langley free-flight tunnel. The glider designated the N. R. L. tailless glider has a straight center section and outboard panels sweptback 43 deg. along {{the leading edge of}} the wing. The aspect ratio is 5. 83 and the taper ratio is 0. 323. From the results of the investigation and on the basis of comparison with higher-scale static tests of the National Research Council of Canada, it is expected that the longitudinal stability of the airplane will be satisfactory with flap up but unsatisfactory near the stall with <b>flap</b> <b>down.</b> The airplane is expected to have unsatisfactory lateral stability and control characteristics in the design configuration with either flap up or <b>flap</b> <b>down.</b> The model flights showed very low damping of the lateral oscillation. Increasing the vertical-tail area improved the lateral stability, and it appeared that a value of the directional-stability parameter C(sub n beta) of at least 0. 002 per degree would probably be necessary for satisfactory lateral flying characteristics. A comparison of the calculated dynamic lateral stability characteristics of the N. R. L. tailless glider with those of a conventional-type sweptback airplane having a similar wing plan form and about the same inclination of the principal longitudinal axis of inertia showed that the tailless glider had poorer lateral stability because of the relatively larger radius of gyration in roll and the smaller damping-in-yaw factor C(sub nr) ...|$|R
