5|$|In January 1962, Suharto was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar. This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's Konfrontasi, against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that Konfrontasi would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.|$|E
50|$|South Seas <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (also called Nanyang <b>Communist</b> <b>Party)</b> was a <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> in South-East Asia {{established}} in 1925 when the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of China separated its exile branches {{in the region}} to make way for local <b>communist</b> <b>parties.</b> SSCP succeeded earlier efforts by the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>communist</b> Tan Malaka to build <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> in the region.|$|R
50|$|The South Seas <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was {{established}} in 1922. The South Seas <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{gave way to the}} formation of Malayan <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (MCP) in 1930. Throughout its formative years in Indonesia and Singapore, the party was actively involved in a failed revolution attempt in Indonesia and workers' union in Singapore. The failure of the 1925 uprising in Indonesia had caused a large influx of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>communists</b> into Singapore.|$|R
40|$|The mass {{killings and}} {{repression}} of the mid 1960 s that marked {{the rise of the}} "New Order" regime of Major General Suharto were a watershed in Indonesian history. Their impact continues to reverberate in Indonesian society in a series of different areas, including the discussion of Indonesian history. After 1965 a narrative of Indonesian history emerged that served to justify the human rights abuses of the regime, both at its genesis in the mid 1960 s, {{as well as those of}} later periods when it faced opposition throughout its reign. Especially since the turn of this century, activists and scholars have begun to challenge this legacy. This dissertation is a part of that movement. It takes an exploratory approach, using a detailed examination of a key source—the cultural supplement (Kebudajaan) of the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> official newspaper (Harian Rakjat) —to shed light on a key area of history in a period preceding the rise of Suharto: that of cultural politics and practice in the communist movement in early 1950 s Indonesia. The dissertation uncovers a number of unexpected phenomena in this history, as it also elaborates on ideas that have already been researched to some extent. In doing so, it helps remove the blinkers of the era of the Suharto regime and the Cold War, revealing a complex movement that managed to elicit the support of millions of Indonesians. It provides detailed evidence-based accounts of various aspects of the history of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>communist</b> cultural politics in the early 1950 s that help "normalise" the discussion of the place of the Indonesian communism in Indonesian history. This account covers a variety of areas, including the way cultural activity was organised and the development of cultural ideology. The dissertation uses three case studies—of cinema, live performing arts, and short creative prose—to develop a better understanding of how these ideas and organisation translated into the production and consumption of different forms of cultural expression. In doing so it also provides insights into the communist movement's own assessments of its cultural activities, and opens up new questions for further study...|$|R
5|$|Indonesian {{nationalism}} and movements supporting independence from Dutch colonialism, such as Budi Utomo, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), Sarekat Islam, and the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PKI), grew {{rapidly in the}} first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated Volksraad ("People's Council") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule. Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony. The most notable of these leaders were Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the Dutch Ethical Policy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s then-President Sukarno {{declared}} {{a new state}} ideology of Nasakom, which stood for Nasionalisme, Agama, dan Komunisme (Nationalism, Religion, and Communism), which would complement the existing policy of Pancasila. This declaration, viewed as proof of increasing <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI) power, led to conflict between the PKI and the military. In {{the midst of an}} escalating confrontation with Malaysia (1963–1966), Sukarno demoted General Abdul Haris Nasution, Commander of the Army, and promoted Ahmad Yani, while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA-sponsored board of generals (Dewan Jenderal) were plotting against the government, using the Gilchrist Document as proof. Eventually, a coup on 30 September 1965, thought to have been sponsored by the PKI, killed six generals, leading to the massacre of suspected communists and the fall of Sukarno's government over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party {{are the only ones}} who can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the British Government {{announcing the}} East of Suez policy in 1968, the British Government {{had begun to}} re-evaluate in the late 1950s its force {{commitment}} in the Far East. As a part of its withdrawal from its Southeast Asian colonies, the UK moved to combine its colonies in North Borneo with the Federation of Malaya (which had become independent from Britain in 1957), and Singapore (which had become self-governing in 1959). In May 1961, the UK and Malayan governments proposed a larger federation called Malaysia, encompassing the states of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, and Singapore. Initially, Indonesia was mildly supportive of the proposed Malaysia, although the PKI (Partai Komunis Indonesia— <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party)</b> was strongly opposed to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{signing of}} highly disadvantageous Renville Agreement caused even greater {{instability}} within the Republican political structure. In Dutch-occupied West Java, Darul Islam guerrillas under Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo maintained their anti-Dutch resistance and repealed any {{loyalty to the}} Republic; they caused a bloody insurgency in West Java and other areas in {{the first decades of}} independence. Prime Minister Sjarifuddin, who signed the agreement, was forced to resign in January 1948, and was replaced by Mohammad Hatta. Hatta cabinet's policy of rationalising the armed forces by demobilising large numbers of armed groups that proliferated the Republican areas, also caused severe disaffection. Leftist political elements, led by resurgent <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PKI) under Musso took advantage of public disaffections by launching rebellion in Madiun, East Java, on 18 September 1948. Bloody fighting continued during late-September until end of October 1948, when the last communist bands were defeated and Musso shot dead. The communists had overestimated their potential to oppose the strong appeal of Sukarno amongst the population.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1946, {{thousands}} of armed men assembled {{to oppose the}} big sultanates after hearing the rumours of the Dutch’s return. Violence and bloodshed was involved, where seven princes, ninety aristocrats (in Langkat) and countless officials from native states were killed. The Sultan of Langkat’s daughters were raped and a poet Tengku Amir Hamzah was killed on 9 March by the Pemuda (young Japanese-trained militant) leaders and many Malay farmers were forced {{to give up their}} plantation land that they had acquired under the Dutch to be redistributed for those former plantation workers and non-Malay farmers.The militants under the leadership of PESINDO (Pemuda Republik Indonesia), <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PKI), and Indonesian National Party (PNI) attacked almost all of the Malay aristocrats. The wives and children of the aristocrat families were interned and their houses were ransacked for treasure by the pemuda. The sympathy that Malay aristocrats had for the Dutch and the threats that they represented to the independence of Republic Indonesia were commonly seen as the two main reasons for the occurrence of this violent event.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 30 September 1965 an {{attempted}} coup took place in Jakarta. Six senior Indonesian military leaders were killed, while General Nasution narrowly escaped from his would be captors. In the ensuing confusion Sukarno agreed to allow Suharto to assume emergency command and control of Jakarta and the armed forces stationed there. Blame for the failed coup was attributed to the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PKI), and in the following weeks and months a campaign of imprisonment and lynching of PKI members and sympathisers broke out across Jakarta and Indonesia. With Suharto's grip on power in Jakarta and Indonesia delicately poised, the scale and intensity of Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo began to ease. The train of events set off by the failed coup led to Suharto's gradual consolidation of power and marginalisation of Sukarno. At the same time, the anti-communist purge spread throughout Indonesia. Suharto's steady consolidation of power after 30 September events allowed him {{to form a new}} government and in March 1967 Suharto was able to form a new Cabinet that excluded Sukarno.|$|E
500|$|In Indonesia, the {{hardline}} anti-communist General Suharto wrested {{control of}} the state from his predecessor Sukarno in an attempt to establish a [...] "New Order". From 1965 to 1966, with the aid of the United States and other Western governments, the military led the mass killing of an estimated half-million members and sympathizers of the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and other leftist organizations. A top-secret CIA report stated that the massacres [...] "rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s." [...] These killings served U.S. strategic interests and constitute a major turning point in the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Complicated and {{partisan}} theories {{continue to}} this day over {{the identity of the}} attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the [...] "New Order", was that the PKI was solely responsible. A propaganda campaign by the army, and Islamic and Catholic student groups, convinced both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup attempt, and that the killings were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes. The army in alliance with religious civilian groups led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government, and armed forces of the communist party and leftist organisations. The purge spread from Jakarta to {{much of the rest of}} the country. (see: Indonesian killings of 1965–1966). The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed. As many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another. As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno's three pillars of support, the <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> was effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam.|$|E
