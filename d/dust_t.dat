40|$|Two of {{the first}} Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) results were that galaxies have {{a wide range of}} values for the ratio of 60 micron to 100 micron flux density (0. 2 {{less than or equal to}} S 60 /S sub 100 less than or equal to 1. 0) and that this ratio is {{correlated}} with Lfir, Lb, Lfir being the total far-infrared luminosity and Lb being the luminosity at visible wavelengths (de Jong et al. 1984; Soifer et al. 1984). From these results arose the following simple model for the far-infrared emission from galaxies (de Jong et al. 1984), which has remained the standard model ever since. In this model, the far-infrared emission comes from two dust components: warm <b>dust</b> (<b>T</b> approx. equals 50 K) intermingled with, and heated by, young massive OB stars in molecular clouds and HII regions, and colder <b>dust</b> (<b>T</b> approx. equals 20 K) associated with the diffuse atomic hydrogen in the interstellar medium and heated by the general interstellar radiation field. As the number of young stars in a galaxy increases, S 60 /S sub 100 increases, because there is a greater proportion of warm dust, and so does Lfir/L sub b, because most of the radiation from the young stars is absorbed by the dust, leading to a swifter increase in far-infrared emission than in visible light. Although this model explains the basic IRAS results, it is inelegant. It uses two free parameters to fit two data (the 60 and 100 micron flux densities) -and there are now several observations that contradict it. Despite these major problems with the two-component model, it is not clear what should be put in its place. When considering possible models for the far-infrared emission from galaxies, the observational evidence for our own galaxy must be considered. Researchers suspect that the study by Boulanger and Perault (1988) of the far-infrared properties of the local interstellar medium may be particularly relevant. They showed that molecular clouds are leaky - that most of the light from OB stars in molecular clouds does not heat the dust in the clouds, but instead leaks out. The consequence of this is that that while most of the far-infrared emission from the solar neighborhood is from dust associated with diffuse HI, this dust is mostly heated by young stars...|$|E

The emission along the minor axis is probably related to large-scale outflows of gas (superwinds) which originate in the nuclear starburst and maybe to star formation in the halo.

40|$|Infrared {{emission}} of circumstellar dust was observed for almost one hundred T Tauri stars. This dust is interpreted {{to be part}} of a protoplanetary disk orbiting the central star. T Tauri stars are young stellar objects and evolve into solar type stars. Planets are believed to form in these disks. The spectral energy distribution of a disk depends on its temperature profile. Different disk regions emit at different wavelengths. The disk-star boundary layer is hot and emits H(alpha) radiation. Inner disk regions at around 1 AU with a temperature of a few hundred Kelvin can be probed in near infrared wavelength regimes. Outer disk regions at around 100 AU distance from the star are colder and emit far infrared and sub-millimeter radiation. Also, X-ray emission from the stellar surface can reveal information on disk properties. Emission from the stellar surface and the boundary layer may be shielded by circumstellar gas and <b>dust.</b> <b>T</b> Tauri stars with low H(alpha) emission, i. e. no boundary layer, show stronger X-ray emission than classical T Tauri stars, because the inner disk regions of weak emission-line T Tauri stars may be clear of material.

40|$|The {{presence}} of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of grains in SN ejecta, {{in accordance with}} current theoretical models. Yet, observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first time, the evolution of newly condensed grains {{from the time of}} formation to their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant. We find that 0. 1 - 0. 6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between 2 - 20 % of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on time-scales of about 4 - 8 x 10 ^ 4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z = 6. 2. Stochastic heating of small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports the idea that large amounts (~ 0. 1 M_sun) of cold <b>dust</b> (<b>T</b> ~ 40 K) can be present in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

Finally, I was tasked with running tests using the new system to confirm system performance. For the Z 2 communication system modifications, it was necessary to investigate alternative speakers and microphones which may have better performance than those currently used in the suit. Further, new speaker and microphone positions needed to be identified to keep them out of the way of the suit user. Once this was done, appropriate hardware (such as speaker or microphone cases and holders) could be prototyped and fabricated. For the suit material strength testing, the first task was to gather and document various test fabrics to identify the best suit material candidates. Then, it was needed to prepare samples for testing to establish baseline measurements and specify a testing procedure. Once the data was fully collected, additional test samples would be prepared and sent off-site to undergo irradiation before being tested again to observe changes in strength performance. For the Bearing <b>Dust</b> Cycle <b>Test,</b> automation was achieved through use of a servo motor and code written in LabVIEW. With this a small electrical servo controller was constructed and added to the system. For the Z 2 communication modifications speaker cases were developed and printed, and new speakers and mics were selected. This allowed us to move the speakers and mics to locations to remain out of the suit users way. For the suit material strength testing, five material candidates were identified and test samples were created. These samples underwent testing, and baseline test results were gathered, though these results are currently being investigated for accuracy. The main process efficiency developed during the course of this internship comes from automation of the Bearing <b>Dust</b> Cycle <b>Test.</b> In particular, many hours of human involvement and precise operation are replaced with a simple motor setup. Thus it is no longer required to man the test, saving valuable employee time. This internship has confirmed a few things for me, namely that I both want to work as an engineer for an aerospace firm and that in particular I want to work for the Johnson Space Center. I am also confirmed in my desire to work with electronics, though I was surprised to enjoy prototyping 3 D CAD design as much as I did. Therefore, I will make an effort to build my skills in this area so that I can continue to design mechanical models. In fact, I found the process of hands-on prototyping to be perhaps the most fun aspect of my time working here. This internship has also furthered my excitement for continual education, and I will hopefully be pursuing a masters in my field in the near future...|$|R
3000|$|In {{the plasma}} {{generated}} by an explosion, the electrons may {{not follow the}} Boltzmann distribution and, hence, their finite mass {{needs to be taken}} into account. Moreover, the relativistic effects of plasma species should be included to realize the exact behavior of the waves or instabilities. Hence, in this article, we consider the relativistic effects of the electrons and ions. Also, we take into account the dust particles which are always present in most of such plasmas and whose charge may fluctuate due to currents flowing into the dust and emissions taking place [22, 23]. Further, we consider the temperature of electrons (T e) to be higher than that of the ions (<b>T</b> i) and <b>dust</b> particles (<b>T</b> d), i.e., [...] T_e≫ T_i≫ T_d, in view of a strongly nonisothermal plasma [24, 25, 26, 27].|$|R
40|$|In this study, the air-side {{pressure}} drop and heat transfer performance of plate-fin and microchannel coils were tested under clean and fouled conditions. The heat exchangers were tested with {{two different types}} of dust, ASHRAE dust and Arizona Road <b>Test</b> <b>Dust.</b> The ASHRAE dust was found to have a very significant impact on the {{pressure drop}} of the microchannel heat exchanger, increasing the air-side pressure drop of the microchannel heat exchanger over 200 % for a dust injection of 267 g (1612. 5 g/m 2). Fouling of the microchannel heat exchanger with Arizona Road <b>Test</b> <b>Dust</b> was not found to increase the air-side pressure drop of the microchannel heat exchanger but was found to decrease the heat transfer rate by more than 10 %. In addition, from studies of the evolution of the air-side pressure drop during the fouling process, it is seen that microchannel coils with louvered fins with fin pitch below 2. 0 mm were significantly more prone to fouling than louvered heat exchangers with larger fin pitch. Particulate fouling of the wavy-plate-fin heat exchanger resulted in significantly lower reductions in heat transfer and increase in air-side pressure drop than for the microchannel heat exchanger.
