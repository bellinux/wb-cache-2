The cost to produce each new penny was 1.6 cents, which exceeded the penny's face value by 0.6 cents. The estimated savings for taxpayers from phasing out the penny is about $11 million a year. Even though the government eliminated the penny from circulation, Canadians can continue to use pennies for cash transactions indefinitely for businesses that choose to accept them or they can redeem rolled pennies at their financial institutions.|$|E

The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre brought pool facility to campus and significantly expanded the size of the gym. The Parapan American Games also brought an addition of seven accessible tennis courts to the Highland Creek valley. The Environmental Science and Chemistry Building, completed in summer 2015, was the third building to open in the north grounds. In 2016, the construction of Highland Hall began on the south grounds of the campus, where the former recreation centre was situated. After completion, Highland Hall will house lecture halls, the registrar office, accessibility services and some social science departments.|$|E

In this paper we investigated the impact of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) on profit efficiency of the Apulian dairy sheep and goat farms. Empirical results through a stochastic frontier model showed that the uninfected farms had a mean level of profit efficiency of 84 %, which dropped to 64 % in the presence of paratubercolosis as it negatively affected the productivity of feeding, veterinary and labour factors. Structural, managerial and production aspects were involved in the greater inefficiency of the infected farms compared to the uninfected ones: lower experience and schooling of farmers, no access to credit, fewer family members (women in particular) participating in the farming activities, high density of animals per hectare, small flocks, high number of goats in mixed flocks, no confinement practices for young and purchased animals and no pasture rotation. Hence, targeted interventions on these factors by decision makers can ensure effectiveness and efficiency to veterinary and <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{creative}} industries have been {{high on the}} agenda of policymakers in recent years, as is evidenced by the EU Lisbon Strategy, which identifies creativity and innovation as a means to enhance competitiveness through quality and differentiation. 1 Recent Irish policy documents have also emphasised this role of creativity and innovation in providing industry with a competitive advantage. The Irish government’s policy document entitled “Building Ireland’s Smart Economy” (2008), sets out a framework for sustainable economic development over the 2009 - 2014 period based on five action areas. 2 One of these action areas, Creating the Innovation Island, involves leveraging the Arts, Culture and Creative Sectors as world class business sector. This recognizes the arts, cultural and {{creative industries}} as key and primary economic contributors, and acknowledges that the challenges for creative industries differ from those in traditional export sectors. The action area identifies intellectual property protection and commercialisation as top priorities, and advocates a policy supporting research and development (R&D) investment in human and creative capital. The Dublin <b>Economic</b> Development <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (2009) also places a strong emphasis on creating a vibrant city, and attaining and retaining creative people. 3 Among the report’s <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> are measures to support the role of the creative industries in developing the knowledge economy through the delivery of local cultural/economic strategies in recognition that culture is essential to Dublin’s economic vitality...|$|R

Other objectives have been to maintain egalitarian income distribution and provision of basic social services to the majority of the population. In order to realize these objectives, the government has been controlling credit and has removed subsidies on certain food items and agricultural inputs; introduced a system of progressive devaluation; liberalized trade; and has been trying to reduce government expenditure by introducing cost sharing measures in the education and health sector...|$|R

3000|$|In this article, these {{immigration}} policies for TCN entrepreneurs are scrutinized on {{their level of}} welcoming. By presenting a first-time model for defining the level of ‘welcoming’, this study adds an instrument to the toolbox of both scholars and policy makers for evaluating migration policies. The model will be tested on the {{immigration policies}} of three Western- European countries ranked in the top- 20 of the Global Innovation Index, The Netherlands, Germany and France. 3 Three elements have been selected to define the ‘welcoming’ nature of immigrant policy: a material element, a procedural element and an institutional element. Materially, welcoming means that migration policy gives some leeway, first at the stage of admission. Welcoming means the host state is not focusing at the risks the proposed business might run, but is willing to give the applicant a chance, possibly even lend a hand. Defining the material test of the national interest in the admission of TCN entrepreneurs is central to this analysis. A second stage arrives when the immigrant applies for an extension of a residence permit or for long term residence. Welcoming policies may include accelerated options into permanent residence, possibly setting less evidentiary requirements. Procedurally, welcoming {{is defined as the}} time it takes to decide an application, relevant because an entrepreneur cannot wait too long to have the business up and running. Welcoming also includes formal criteria such as fees to be paid, transparency of the procedure and available legal protection. The third element of welcoming is related to the institutional or private actors deciding on an application. Selecting foreign investors, entrepreneurs (experienced, scale-ups or start-ups) and solo self-employed migrants is often interlinked with <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Regional strategies are important when it comes to retaining highly skilled migrants such as (former) students (David & Coenen, 2014), and may just as well be important in selecting entrepreneurs and designing entrepreneurship policy. Private actors, such as chambers of commerce or professional organizations may also play their part in defining economic needs. Thus, the question which institutional or private actors decide, or are involved in the decision-making process on admitting immigrant entrepreneurs, is the third element of the ‘welcoming talent’ model. Following from the above the research question addressed is: How welcoming are French, German and Dutch immigration policies and practices for TCN immigrant entrepreneurs? [...]...|$|R
40|$|Calculation {{has been}} {{recently}} discussed {{in relationship to}} market transactions as: (1) a set of operations, including classifications and computations, which support decision-making processes by <b>economic</b> actors; (2) <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> or strategies which can be evaluated against efficacy criteria; (3) broader social processes which induce behavioral modifications and transformations along (1) and (2). Calculations would appear as situated plans or strategies, bounded by institutional constraints, and anchored in classifications, computations, and evaluations, strategies which are implemented within trading interactions. Such plans make use of available resources and adapt to constraints, but are prior with respect to live trading interactions. Using a conceptual apparatus anchored {{in the work of}} Erving Goffman, I argue that calculation is situational action. Its features are shaped by the interaction order of trading, and it can be conceptualized as emerging from gaming encounters [...] i. e., competitive displays of the participants' socially relevant attributes. These arguments are supported with empirical data from online, anonymous financial trading. In these markets, gaming encounters make anonymous strangers present in the trader's situation, as a basis for assessing the relevance of displays on the trading screen and for reacting to these displays. At the same time, traders engage in repeated self-displays as a means for defining their own situation and for projecting subsequent action sequences. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: An <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> is an {{agreement}} between clinician and patient that the patient will make a spe-cific behavior change.

Methods: Forty-three clinicians in 8 primary care sites were recruited to hold action-plan discus-sions with patients. Research assistants contacted patients by telephone 3 weeks later to assess whether patients had conducted their <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Eighty-three percent of enrolled patients (228) made an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> during a primary care visit. Of the 79 % who recalled making the <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> when interviewed by telephone 3 weeks later, 56 % recalled the details of their <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> and an additional 33 % recalled the general nature of the <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> At least 53 % of patients making an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> reported making a behavior change consistent with that <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: Most patients reported making a behavior change based on an <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> may be a useful strategy to encourage behavior change for patients seen in primary care.

40|$|Objective: <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> is {{regarded}} as an important correlate and predictor of health behaviour, but {{little is known about}} antecedents of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Because personality constructs have been shown to moderate the effect of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> interventions, the present study tested associations of personality dimensions with <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and fruit consumption. Design and setting: Cross-sectional data collected with self-administered questionnaires in a university setting. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 443; mean age = 21. 45 (SD = 2. 96) years, 68. 7 % females) who participated for course credits and completed measures of personality dimensions, <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> intention, and fruit consumption based on validated questionnaires. The first set of analyses focused on antecedents of fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> employing stepwise regression analysis. The second set of analyses focused on intention and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as mediators of the personality-fruit consumption link using structural equation modelling. Results: Higher scores for fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> were found for more conscientiousness and less neurotic individuals. Further, more conscientious individuals consumed more fruits and this relationship was mediated by <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusion: Findings provide support for <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as a mediator in the Conscientiousness-fruit consumption link and suggest that personality influences may need {{to be taken into account}} when developing <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies aimed at increasing fruit consumption...|$|R
