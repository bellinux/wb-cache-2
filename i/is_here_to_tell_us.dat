6000|$|... "Well, we {{all thought}} she was sinking," [...] {{returned}} Captain Ponsberry. [...] "If she had sunk I reckon some of us wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. If I thought so, I {{should not}} <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what I thought. It is because I {{believe that you}} are injured that I am here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He is a brave fellow," [...] {{he said to}} Cuitcatl, who had {{accompanied}} them, [...] "and fought manfully and well. Had he not guarded my back during the fight, I should not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale, now." ...|$|R
60|$|Morton (slowly and seriously). He {{has left}} me <b>here</b> <b>to</b> answer the {{unanswered}} question you asked him. (Enter Don Jose and Col. STARBOTTLE, R. and L.) I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I am his father, {{and that he}} is Alexander Morton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] he remarked, [...] "you {{have had}} a pretty narrow escape. If we had not got in when we did, you would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale. I don't know that I ever saw any one much nearer to the undertaker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasant enough, sir, on the whole; {{but we were}} {{attacked}} by the Malay pirates, and I should certainly not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale, at present, {{had it not been}} for the quickness and shrewdness of a lad, who had been shipwrecked on the coast." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, National Journal named Love one of ten Republicans {{to follow}} on Twitter.

5000|$|Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly also {{commented on}} the {{relation}} between the opening scene and the episode's overall concept of truth: [...] "The truth is pliable, and it can be swayed by those with power. Making the assertion that something is fact when there is no one powerful enough to hold you accountable — ahem! — can transform the statement into a version of the truth. 'We <b>are</b> not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories,' the Stasi officer says. 'We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth.' The show itself performs its own tongue-in-cheek take on this idea each week by stating that following is true when the audience has no way to refute it." [...] He also noted that the science fiction-related elements in Ennis Stussy's house (a film on television and the books Gloria finds) are reminiscent of the occasional science fiction elements in season 2.|$|R

Whether it is {{tampering}} with radio controls, putting [...] "DIVERSION" [...] road signs in the wrong places or going on dates with the buxom clippies, they are always getting into scrapes. Jack is also the shop steward of the bus depot, and frequently abuses his position to thwart Blakey's schemes, usually with the catchphrase [...] "As shop steward I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you.....".|$|R
5000|$|He {{returned}} to Broadway on September 19, 2006, {{in the role}} of Gaston in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. He was scheduled to perform for nine weeks, but due to popular demand he extended his run through December 24. Liz Smith of the New York Post wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you he <b>is</b> charmingly campy, good-looking and grand as the villain 'Gaston', patterned after our old friend Elvis", and noting [...] "Donny is divine".

5000|$|The joke, which spread far {{and wide}} and was {{repeated}} everywhere, was said to end with an assertion that this line had caused his detention — and would cause his later self-exile from Cuba in the same year. However, this story was later denied in Miami by Fernández, who, on hearing it from an alleged theater hand present at that performance, corrected the storyteller with visible displeasure and said: [...] "Gentlemen, had I done and said those things, I would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the story… [...] ".|$|R
5000|$|Todd Mowatt of Electric Playground wrote, [...] "Like a flame broiled Whopper at Burger King, {{this game}} is being loaded with features, {{including}} an original storyline.

5000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{a little}} bit about what a Cajun is. A Cajun is a person who his {{homeland}} was France. Went into Nova Scotia, at the time Acadia, and settled there and was there for about a hundred years, and afterwards the British took over the territory and then the French-speaking people, the French descendants, known as the Acadians, came down to the South-Western part of Louisiana, and that was back in 1755.

The dogs and I did badly, after our master's death; our luck was against us. I lost one of my little brothers--the best {{performer}} of the two; he was stolen, and I never recovered him. My fiddle and my stilts were taken from me next, by main force, by a tramp who was stronger than I. These misfortunes drew Tommy and me--I beg your pardon, sir, I mean the dog--closer together than ever.|$|R
6000|$|Elinor {{glanced at}} Marian, {{and saw that}} though Douglas was {{speaking}} {{to her in a}} low voice, she was listening nervously to her husband. So she said sharply, [...] "It is a pity you <b>were</b> not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us what <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{theme of}} the book, at least as {{perceived}} from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. [...] A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: [...] "... with all due respect, I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{it does not take}} a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child."
