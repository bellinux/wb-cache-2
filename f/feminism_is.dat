5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Male {{participation}} in <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Radical {{feminism}} {{considers the}} male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression {{and the total}} uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E
50|$|Hip-hop <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> {{created by}} feminists {{who felt that}} black <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> not {{equipped}} to consider the issues of women belonging to the hip-hop generation. The term hip hop <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> coined by the provocative cultural critic Joan Morgan in 1999 when she published the book When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip Hop Feminist Breaks it Down.|$|R
5000|$|Protofeminist is a {{philosophical}} tradition that anticipates modern feminism {{in an era}} when the concept of <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> still unknown, i. e. before the 20th century. Precise usage is disputed, as 18th-century feminism and 19th-century <b>feminism</b> <b>are</b> subsumed under [...] "feminism". The utility of the term protofeminist is rejected by some modern scholars, as is the term postfeminist.|$|R

5|$|<b>Feminism</b> <b>is</b> a {{range of}} {{political}} movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes. This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to such opportunities for men.|$|E
5|$|Jewish <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> a {{movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E
5|$|Christian <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch}} of feminist {{theology}} which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} feminist {{organization}} in Europe was founded during the 1920s in modern western Ukraine or Galicia. The organization was called the Ukrainian Woman's Union, and was led by Milena Rudnytska. During the Soviet-era <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> classified as a bourgeois ideology, hence counterrevolutionary and anti-Soviet. Civil society and <b>feminism</b> <b>were</b> virtually nonexistent in the Soviet times. After independence of Ukraine in 1991, a feminist movement began taking root.|$|R

25|$|Indigenous <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> an intersectional {{theory and}} {{practice}} of feminism that focuses on decolonization and indigenous sovereignty. The focus is upon empowering indigenous women in the context of indigenous cultural values and priorities, rather than mainstream, white, patriarchal ones. In this cultural perspective, it can be compared to womanism in the African-American communities.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> {{also known}} by other, {{geographically}} specific, names such as: Native American feminism in the United States and Canada, or Aboriginal feminism in Australia. Despite {{the use of}} the more globally-applicable word “indigenous”, the majority of text that refers to “Indigenous feminism” tends to focus on North American indigenous populations (Native American, First Nations, Inuit and Métis).|$|E
25|$|British {{newspaper}} The Guardian and {{the website}} Jezebel have also reported on {{an increasing number}} of women and female celebrities rejecting feminism and instead subscribing to humanism. As a response to a pro-feminism speech by Australian Labor Senator Penny Wong, several women who identify as being humanist and antifeminist argued in an article for the Guardian that <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> a discriminatory ideology and continues to portray women as victims.|$|E

25|$|Much of Indigenous {{feminism}} {{has taken}} shape around issues {{that resulted from}} colonial practices. Indigenous <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> a direct result of, and a direct answer to the colonization and continued oppression of Indigenous peoples around the world. The need to question cultural practices from within allows Indigenous women to actively shape their own communities and helps encourage self-determination and cultural ownership. Differentiating Indigenous feminism from white feminism illuminates the ways that white feminism does not fully account for Indigenous experiences.|$|E
25|$|The women's liberation {{movement}} is closely {{connected to the}} New Left and other new social movements that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. Socialist feminism, as exemplified by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women; and Marxist feminism, as with Selma James, saw themselves {{as a part of}} the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and sexist structures within the Left. Liberal <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> closely connected with social liberalism and the left wing of mainstream American politics (e.g., National Organization for Women).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s some {{began to}} see the {{advancing}} theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This dichotomy is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> trying to break. Out of this critique rose the anti-essentialist argument. Ecofeminist and author Noel Sturgeon says in an interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.|$|E

5|$|<b>Feminism</b> <b>was</b> {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|R

25|$|Riot grrrl {{culture is}} often {{associated}} with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave <b>feminism</b> <b>is</b> said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>Feminism</b> <b>was</b> {{directly}} {{correlated with}} the abolitionist movements {{and as a result}} many famous feminists and activists began to have their voices heard. Some of these early activists include, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, Jane Addams, and Dorothy Day. The first wave of <b>feminism</b> <b>was</b> primarily led by white women in the middle class, and {{it was not until the}} second wave of feminism that women of color began developing a voice. The term <b>Feminism</b> <b>was</b> created like a political illustrated ideology at that period. Feminism emerged by the speech about the reform and correction of democracy based on equalitarian conditions. With Wollstonecraft's work, the illustrated feminist polemic was displayed, and as a result, suffragist movements were stood up. Wollstonecraft is regarded as the grandmother of British feminism and her ideas shaped the thinking of the suffragettes, who campaigned for the women's vote. After generations of work, this was eventually achieved.|$|R
