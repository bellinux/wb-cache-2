5|$|In 1865, {{a one-room}} schoolhouse {{was built on}} land donated by John Whitson {{on the south side}} of Pleasantville Road, between the Pocantico River and the New York & Putnam Railroad (now NY Route 9A/100). The {{building}} (Whitson's School, District No. 6) became the first schoolhouse in the area. George A. Todd, Jr. was the first teacher and superintendent of the school. In 1867, the school was moved to the White School, named thus due to its <b>exterior</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar XJ220 Pininfarina is {{a special}} XJ220 built in 1995 for the Sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri, who {{commissioned}} a number of rare and one-off heavily modified cars based on expensive luxury cars. This car was modified by Pininfarina, with modifications including fixed headlights, new rear lights with a redesigned double-vane rear wing, and a new interior package. The car also comes with dark green <b>exterior</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the city—a {{question in the}} original version of Trivial Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, <b>exterior</b> <b>paint</b> colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new <b>exterior</b> <b>paint</b> scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 6, 677, 000 apartment housing units in South Korea. <b>Exterior</b> wall <b>painting</b> for such multi-dwelling apartment housings in South Korea represents a typical area to which construction automation {{technology can be}} applied for improvement in safety, productivity, quality, and cost over the conventional method. The conventional <b>exterior</b> wall <b>painting</b> is costly and labor-intensive, and it especially exposes workers to significant health and safety risks. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to design a conceptual model of an <b>exterior</b> wall <b>painting</b> robot which is applicable to apartment housing construction and maintenance, and to conduct its technical?economical feasibility analyses. In this study, a design concept using a high ladder truck is proposed as the best alternative for automation of the <b>exterior</b> wall <b>painting.</b> Conclusions made in this study show that the proposed <b>exterior</b> wall <b>painting</b> robot is technically and economically feasible, and can greatly enhance safety, productivity, and quality compared to the conventional method. Finally, it is expected that the conceptual model of the <b>exterior</b> wall <b>painting</b> robot would be efficiently used in various applications in exterior wall finishing and maintenance of other architectural and civil structures such as commercial buildings, towers, and high-rise storage tanks...|$|R
25|$|The Bell Telephone Company of Canada (renamed to Bell Canada in 1968), {{which had}} {{provided}} financial and other {{support to the}} Homestead since 1921, assigned its own historian to head the Homestead's restoration committee in 1969.

25|$|For {{many years}} {{the house was}} painted gray.

Although side (quarter) window louvers (as shown in picture) are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{evidence demonstrating that}} the historical use of leaded gasoline and lead (Pb) in <b>exterior</b> <b>paints</b> in Australia has contaminated urban soils in the older inner suburbs of large cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. While significant attention {{has been focused on}} Pb poisoning in mining and smelting towns in Australia, relatively little research has focused on exposure to Pb originating from inner-city soil dust and its potential for childhood Pb exposures. Due to a lack of systematic blood lead (PbB) screening and geochemical soil Pb mapping in the inner cities of Australia, the risks from environmental Pb exposure remain unconstrained within urban population centres. Previous use of Pb in gasoline and Pb in <b>exterior</b> <b>paints</b> in Australia has contaminated urban soils in the older inner suburbs of large cities and the risks remain unconstrained. 9 page(s...|$|R
