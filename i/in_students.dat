5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher <b>in</b> <b>students</b> given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase <b>in</b> <b>students</b> necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influences of Millennial involvement <b>in</b> <b>student</b> advocacy.

For this study we will interview college <b>students</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>student</b> advocacy, specifically <b>student</b> leaders involved <b>in</b> agriculture-related advocacy organizations. The interviews will lead to potential factors that motivate students to become involved and stay involved <b>in</b> <b>student</b> advocacy.

However, there is not a clear understanding of how Millennial college <b>students</b> engage <b>in</b> <b>student</b> advocacy. The Millennial generation is known to be more confident, conventional, and team-oriented than other generations. Millennials are future oriented, more tradition learners compared to Generation X, and like working with others (Lowery, 2004).
