5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task <b>experiment,</b> <b>in</b> which a subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E
40|$|Experiments play {{a central}} role in science. The role of <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> {{computing}} is, however, unclear. Questions about the relevance of <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> computing attracted little attention until the 1980 s. As the discipline then saw a push towards experimental computer science, a variety of technically, theoretically, and empirically oriented views on experiments emerged. As a consequence of those debates, today's computing fields use experiments and <b>experiment</b> terminology <b>in</b> a variety of ways. This paper analyzes experimentation debates in computing. It presents five ways in which debaters have conceptualized <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> computing: feasibility <b>experiment,</b> trial experiment, field experiment, comparison experiment, and controlled experiment. This paper has three aims: to clarify <b>experiment</b> terminology <b>in</b> computing; to contribute to disciplinary self-understanding of computing; and, due to computing’s centrality in other fields, to promote understanding of <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> modern science in general...|$|R

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy of secrecy, these were not disclosed until well after the Apollo 1 fire. Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Jodrell Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.|$|E
40|$|Urban living labs {{have emerged}} as {{transition}} arenas for undertaking process-oriented and reflexive <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> the multi-stakeholder governance of sustainability. This paper evaluates Livewell Yarra, an urban living lab in Melbourne, Australia, that brought together academic researchers and community actors to engage <b>in</b> <b>experiments</b> for low-carbon living. This paper evaluates transition team <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> governance of the lab itself and community <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> carbon reduction {{that took place in}} people’s homes and small group settings known as decarb groups. This paper’s primary research question is: what are the direct impacts of urban living lab experiments from the participants’ perspective? The research methods utilised include action research, asset-based community development, participatory co-design and most significant change research. This paper evaluates <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> low-carbon living through data collected via stories of change from participant interviews. The results indicate that <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> urban living labs create opportunities for social learning and empowerment, but also raise issues of leadership and ownership of transition governance. The findings suggest that Livewell Yarra could have benefited from clearer agenda setting and continuous monitoring to feedback results. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions that utilise the operational processes of transition management to support <b>experiments</b> <b>in</b> urban living labs...|$|R

5|$|Nowadays, using {{oscilloscopes}} {{with time}} resolutions {{of less than}} one nanosecond, {{the speed of light}} can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror.

5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande <b>experiment</b> <b>in</b> 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
