How {{economic}} agents can make sense from imperfect information {{is a central}} challenge in economic theory. In this thesis, I first explore how voters try to infer {{the quality of their}} government based not only on the information they personally receive but also on observations of their home and foreign governments' policies. Can voters learn from such information and thus any improved accountability reduce "political pandering"? Secondly, I study two models of education where the incentives of both students and firms are profoundly affected by the imperfect informativeness of education certificates and study how increases in enrolment and tuition fees affect educational and job market outcomes. The first chapter, Pandering Across Borders, studies when voters can use information from foreign countries to reduce domestic political pandering, and when pandering is contagious between countries. The voters condition their electoral decisions not only on policies chosen in their home countries, but also on those implemented abroad. Since the policy decisions are driven by re-election concerns, both sources of information may be biased. As a result, informational linkages between the countries give rise to pandering externalities which lead to ambiguous welfare effects of access to international news. The model also shows that institutional harmonisation via <b>internal</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of election dates increases the parameter range in which pandering may occur. Beliefs, Access Constraints and Voluntary Education Decisions, the second chapter of this thesis, contributes to the debate on the negative consequences of high growth rates in university enrollment with a focus on CEE countries. I propose a theory how low education supply elasticities in the short run can lead to self-fulfilling equilibria in a setting in which signalling is reduced to an effortless binary certification technology. When the agents believe that the certification precision is low they enrol at a higher rate and, due to those inelasticities, their beliefs fulfil. The opposite holds when the agents have high beliefs on the quality. The selection among these equilibria depends on students' initial beliefs {{about the quality of the}} certification technology. The final chapter, Tuition Fees in a Signalling Model of Education, analyses the trade-off between tuition fees and educational effort. Education serves purely as a signaling device and implies a non-pecuniary cost inversely proportional to students' ability, while tuition fees are independent of ability. In this framework, higher tuition fees can be beneficial for high ability students since they reduce the enrolment rates of the less able agents reducing the effort level necessary to separate. The overall effect of tuition fees is complex and is associated with non-monotonicities in actions of the players in the model...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to fill the gap within the lean literature about teaching and introducing pulse methodology. It presents a case study where digital pulse methodology was introduced to a customer-order-driven product development and production company within the dental device industry to help the company efficiently manage the deviations arising from daily operations so that it becomes more lean by visualising important data and capturing and reusing knowledge.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have many}} {{application}} scenarios where external clock synchronisation {{may be required}} because a WSN may consist of components which are not connected to each other. In this paper, we first propose a novel weighted average-based <b>internal</b> clock <b>synchronisation</b> (WICS) protocol, which synchronises all the clocks of a WSN with the clock of a reference node periodically. Based on this protocol, we then propose our weighted average-based external clock synchronisation (WECS) protocol. We have analysed the proposed protocols for maximum synchronisation error and shown that it is always upper bounded. Extensive simulation studies of the proposed protocols {{have been carried out}} using Castalia simulator. Simulation results validate our above theoretical claim and also show that the proposed protocols perform better in comparison to other protocols in terms of synchronisation accuracy. A prototype implementation of the WICS protocol using a few TelosB motes also validates the above conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The {{weighted}} average based clock synchronisation protocols for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), viz., energy efficient and fault-tolerant clock synchronisation (EFCS) protocol, {{weighted average}} based <b>internal</b> clock <b>synchronisation</b> (WICS) protocol, and weighted average based external clock synchronisation (WECS) protocol, have several fault-tolerant properties including automatic interchangeability among these protocols, but a major problem with these protocols is that their synchronisation accuracy is not very high. In this paper, we propose a generic technique to improve the synchronisation accuracy in these three protocols. We also give a proof that the synchronisation error in the EFCS protocol is bounded. The improved protocols also make use of estimated drift rate to provide an accurate reading of time at any instant, and the logical time provided by these protocols is monotonic. The simulation and experimental studies clearly show that the average synchronisation error in the improved protocols is much less than that in the original protocols...|$|R
40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that land use/management changes (LUMCs) can impact runoff generation {{at the local}} scale; however, {{it is unclear how}} these impacts are modified as they travel through the river channel network to affect downstream catchment flooding. There is a need for data from multiscale monitoring studies in catchments undergoing known LUMCs to assess the extent to which impacts can be detected at increasing catchment scales. This understanding is needed in developing reliable methods for assessing the potential of rural based flood prevention and mitigation measures, urgently required by catchment planners. The aim of the present study is to generate and analyse a new multiscale dataset which will serve {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of local LUMCs on catchment response at increasing scales. This study investigates the impacts of recent LUMCs (drain blocking, stocking density changes, and afforestation) in the headwaters of the River Hodder (261 km²), North-West England, UK. An unusually dense nested monitoring network (28 stream gauges) was set up at scales ranging rom ~ 1 ha to 261 km². Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) modelling and a simple Storage Discharge Detection (SDD) model were used to compare pre- and post-change hydrographs at increasing scales in an effort to detect short-term change signals and their propagation to larger scales. A novel physically based Model for Upland Runoff Storage and Flow Fields (MURSAFF) was developed to further investigate the short- and long-term impacts of LUMC in complex landscapes at the micro catchment scale (~ 1 km²). The results were integrated into a semi-distributed catchment impact routing model to explore the effects on the downstream catchment response. No statistically significant evidence was found in the DBM and SDD results to suggest that any of the LUMCs had a short-term impact on catchment response at scales from 1 km² up to the Hodder catchment scale (261 km²). This is attributed to the proportion of area affected by change, the timescale of impacts, and the natural variability in catchment response. Short-term small scale (< 1 km²) field observations and MURSAFF predictions of the impacts of drain blocking involved an increase in the local storage and change in the flow fields. However, these changes are insignificant at the micro catchment scale. The MURSAFF simulated impacts of reductions in stocking density involve attenuation of the flood hydrograph mainly. Predictions of the downstream effects suggest they will be relatively small and different for each storm, with the lack of <b>internal</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of the sub-catchment responses and the natural variability therein being dominant factors in determining the impacts on the catchment outlet response. These predictions are consistent with the failure to detect any significant impacts in the post-change records. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Requirements for {{multicast}} capabilities {{have been}} identified in object based distributed systems {{for a wide range of}} purposes. This paper describes the design and implementation of a group invocation facility in the Advanced Networked Systems Architecture (ANSA). The design allows the construction of groups of interfaces which may be invoked as a single unit. There are options of fully transparent group usage or explicit access to lists of results from individual group members. The model allows groups to be configurable by means of well-defined policies which users can provide. Such policies allow control over the criteria for group membership, patterns of invocation, and <b>internal</b> group <b>synchronisation,</b> but do not address higher level group management requirements such as failure transparency of members or member coordination and consistency. Instead, it is argued that such considerations should be the responsibility of external management entities. 1. Introduction An increasingly wide [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} {{modification}} of the Kuramoto model for phase oscillators coupled on a network. Here, two populations of oscillators are considered, each with different network topologies, internal and cross-network couplings and frequencies. Additionally, frustration parameters for the interactions of the cross-network phases are introduced. This may {{be regarded as a}} model of competing populations: internal to any one network phase synchronisation is a target state, while externally one or both populations seek to frequency synchronise to a phase in relation to the competitor. We conduct fixed point analyses for two regimes: one, where <b>internal</b> phase <b>synchronisation</b> occurs for each population with the potential for instability in the phase of one population in relation to the other; the second where one part of a population remains fixed in phase in relation to the other population, but where instability may occur within the first population leading to `fragmentation'. We compare analytic results to numerical solutions for the system at various critical thresholds. Comment: 31 pages, 9 figures, accepted by Physica...|$|R
