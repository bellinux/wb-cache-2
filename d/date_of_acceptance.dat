Column densities were derived from fits to the 3 pπ(0) absorption band whose oscillator strength is well established. These are the first reported measurements for ^ 13 C^ 18 O.

40|$|Element {{diffusion}} {{is expected}} to occur {{in all kinds of}} stars : according to the relative effect of gravitation and radiative acceleration, they can fall or be pushed up in the atmospheres. Helium sinks in all cases, thereby creating a gradient {{at the bottom of the}} convective zones. This can have important consequences for the sound velocity, as has been proved in the sun with helioseismology. We investigate signatures of helium diffusion in late F-type stars by asteroseismology. Stellar models were computed with different physical inputs (with or without element diffusion) and iterated in order to fit close-by evolutionary tracks for each mass. The theoretical oscillation frequencies were computed and compared for pairs of models along the tracks. Various asteroseismic tests (large separations, small separations, second differences) were used and studied for the comparisons. The results show that element diffusion leads to changes in the frequencies for masses larger than 1. 2 Msun. In particular the helium gradient below the convective zone should be detectable through the second differences.

Methods: We performed an intensive study of a sample of thirteen INTEGRAL sources, through multi-wavelength optical to NIR photometric and spectroscopic observations, using EMMI and SofI instruments at the ESO NTT telescope. We performed accurate astrometry and identified candidate counterparts for which we give the optical and NIR magnitudes. We detected many spectral lines allowing us to determine the spectral type of the companion star.

Furthermore, the molecule has been recently identified at the EU-wide level as one of the novel psychoactive substances. This paper aims at investigating the potential of misuse, taking into account both the existing literature and the analysis of the misusers' experiences as described in venlafaxine misuse web reports. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Medline. Posts/threads relating to venlafaxine misuse issues were identified through Google?? and Yahoo?? English-language searches. Resulting websites' data were then qualitatively assessed, and information was collected on a range of issues, including dosage, drug intake modalities, untoward drug effects, and association with other recreational drugs. Results: A few literature case reports focusing on venlafaxine as a misusing drug were here identified. The molecule was here typically ingested or snorted at dosages up to 10 ??? 15 times higher than those clinically advised, obtaining MDMA/amphetamine-like stimulant and psychedelic effects.

Despite this, to date, the promise of an empirically derived typology has largely been neglected. In addressing this gap, this article sets out a typology developed from Social Movement Theory. Using a novel statistical technique to derive a three-dimensional framework for categorising militant groups, the typology incorporates both organisational characteristics and the wider political context. The result is a typology defined by three conceptual constructs: political capacity, war-making capacity, and network capacity. Alongside these organisational features, imposing measures of the wider political opportunity structure reveals eight types of militant organisation. To explore the utility of the framework, a preliminary analysis interprets the typology in light of the presence of wider conflict. That a robust relationship is found between the various types and whether groups were operating in peacetime, civil war, or low-intensity conflict, goes some way to demonstrating its utility as an analytical tool. Conclusions draw attention to the importance of contextualising militant groups in their socio-political setting, and the benefits of combining theory alongside empirical analysis to develop robust characterisations of violent organisations.

40|$|Context. Red giant branch (RGB) {{stars are}} very bright objects in galaxies {{and are often}} used as {{standard}} candles. Interferometry is the ideal tool to characterize the dynamics and morphology of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim at precisely characterising the surface dynamics of a sample of RGB stars. Methods. We obtained interferometric observations for three RGB stars with the MIRC instrument mounted at the CHARA interfer- ometer. We looked for asymmetries on the stellar surfaces using limb-darkening models. Results. We measured the apparent diameters of HD 197989 (Epsilon Cyg) = 4. 61 +- 0. 02 mas, HD 189276 (HR 7633) = 2. 95 +- 0. 01 mas, and HD 161096 (Beta Oph) = 4. 43 +- 0. 01 mas. We detected departures from the centrosymmetric case for all three stars with the tendency of a greater effect for lower logg of the sample. We explored the causes of this signal and conclude that a possible explanation to the interferometric signal is the convection-related and/or the magnetic-related surface activity. However, {{it is necessary to}} monitor these stars with new observations, possibly coupled with spectroscopy, in order to firmly establish the cause.

Context: The INTEGRAL mission {{has led to}} the discovery of a new type of supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs), whose physical properties differ from those of previously known SGXBs. Those sources are in the course of being unveiled by means of multi-wavelength X-rays, optical, near- and mid-infrared observations, and two classes are appearing. The first class consists of obscured persistent SGXBs and the second is populated by the so-called supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs). Aims: We report here mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the companion stars of twelve SGXBs from these two classes in order to assess the contribution of the star and the material enshrouding the system to the total emission. } Methods: We used data from observations we carried out at ESO/VLT with VISIR, as well as archival and published data, to perform broad-band spectral energy distributions of the companion stars and fitted them with a combination of two black bodies representing the star and a MIR excess due to the absorbing material enshrouding the star, if there was any.

Determination of physical parameters for these stars has also been carried out to locate them on the HR diagram and check the instability strip for this type of pulsators. Multichannel photomultiplier and CCD time series photometry in the uvby Strömgren and BVI Johnson bands were obtained during four consecutive years from 2007 to 2010. The light curves have been analysed, and a variability criterion has been established. Among the objects classified as variable stars, we have selected those which present periodicities above 4 d^(- 1), which was established as the lowest limit for δ Scuti-type pulsations in this investigation. Finally, these variable stars have been placed in a colour-magnitude diagram using the physical parameters derived with the collected uvbyβ Strömgren-Crawford photometry. Five PMS δ Scuti- and three probable β Cephei-type stars have been detected. Two additional PMS δ Scuti stars are also confirmed in this work.

The goal {{of this study is to}} obtain the stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in the X 1908 + 075 high-mass X-ray binary system with a stellar atmosphere model to check whether previous studies from X-ray observations and spectral morphology lead to a sufficient description of the donor star. We obtained H- and K-Band spectra of X 1908 + 075 and analysed them with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. For the first time, we calculated a stellar atmosphere model for the donor star, whose main parameters are: M_spec = 15 ± 6 M_, T_∗ = 23 _- 3 ^+ 6,kK, g_eff = 3. 0 ± 0. 2 and L/L_ = 4. 81 ± 0. 25. The obtained parameters point towards an early B-type (B 0 [...] B 3) star, probably in a supergiant phase.

The exsolution process was found to initially induce {{the formation of a}} 20 - 30 nm deep pit on the oxide surface followed by the emergence of a Ni particle {{at the bottom of the}} pit. Continued emergence of the particle results in it nearly filling the pit producing a unique structure in which the Ni particle is socketed into the oxide surface. We also show that this morphological evolution can be explained using a simple energy-based model that accounts for the interplay between the surface free energy and the strain energy induced by the included metal nucleate. The unique socketed structure results in strong anchorage between the exsolved particles and the oxide host lattice which imparts both high thermal stability and unique catalytic activity.

Our optical and near-infrared photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy indicate that S Ori J 053825. 4 - 024241 is a likely cluster member with a mass estimated from evolutionary models at 0. 06 + 0. 07 - 0. 02 Msol, which makes the object a probable brown dwarf. The radial velocity of S Ori J 053825. 4 - 024241 {{is similar to the}} cluster systemic velocity. This target, which we have classified as an M 6. 0 +- 1. 0 low-gravity object, shows excessemission in the near-infrared and anomalously strong photometric variability for its type (from the blue to the J band), suggesting the presence of a surrounding disc. The optical spectroscopic observations show a continuum excess at short wavelengths and a persistent and resolved Halpha emission (pseudo-equivalent width of ~- 250 AA) in addition to the presence of other forbidden and permitted emission lines, which we interpret as indicating accretion from the disc and possibly mass loss.
