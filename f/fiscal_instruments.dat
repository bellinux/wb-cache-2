40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the study of}} optimal fiscal policy in a growing economy by exploring {{a case in which}} the government simultaneously provides three main categories of expenditures with distortionary tax finance: public production services, public consumption services, and state-contingent redistributive transfers. The paper shows that in a general equilibrium model with given exogenous fiscal policy, a nonlinear relation exists between the suboptimal longrun growth rate in a competitive economy and distortionary tax rates. When fiscal policy is endogenously chosen at a social optimum, the relation between the rate of growth and tax rates is always negative. These two conclusions suggest that the interaction between fiscal policy and growth may be complicated enough that it cannot be captured in a simple linear model using an aggregate measure of fiscal policy. The sources of nonlinearity include expectation and coordination of fiscal policy, impluse response of government policies, and the presence of positive externality due to government spending.

Third, in the short run, all <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> except labor taxes react strongly to debt, but long-run intertemporal financing comes from all components of the government’s budget constraint.

40|$|Extending Gali and Monacelli (2004), {{we build}} an N-country open economy model, where each economy {{is subject to}} sticky wages and prices and, potentially, has access to sales and income taxes as well as {{government}} spending as <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> We examine an economy either as a small open economy operating under flexible exchange rates or {{as a member of}} a monetary union. In a small open economy when all three <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> are freely available, we show analytically that the welfare impact of technology and mark-up shocks can be completely eliminated (in the sense that policy can replicate the efficient flex price equilibrium), whether policy acts with discretion or commitment. However, once any one of these <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> is excluded as a stabilisation tool, costs can emerge. Using simulations, we find that the useful fiscal instrument in this case (in the sense of reducing the welfare costs of the shock) is either income taxes or sales taxes. In constrast, having government spending as an instrument contributes very little. The results for an individual member of a monetary union facing an idiosyncratic technology shock (where monetary policy in the union does not respond) are very different. First, even with all <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> freely available, the technology shock will incur welfare costs. Government spending is potentially useful as a stabilisation device, because it can act as a partial substitute for monetary policy. Finally, sales taxes are more effective than income taxes at reducing the costs of a technology shock under monetary union. If all three taxes are available, they can reduce the impact of the technology shock on the union member by around a half, compared to the case where fiscal policy is not used. Finally we consider the robustness of these results to two extensions. Firstly, introducing government debt, such that policy makers take account of the debt consequences of using <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> as stabilisation devices, and, secondly, introducing implementation lags in the use of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> We find that the need for debt sustainability has a very limited impact on the use of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> for stabilisation purposes, while implementation lags can reduce, but not eliminate, the gains from fiscal stabilisation. ...|$|E

40|$|August 2005. Very {{preliminary}} draft. Please do not quote without permission. Abstract: Extending Gali and Monacelli (2004), {{we build}} an N-country open economy model, where each economy {{is subject to}} sticky wages and prices and, potentially, has access to sales and income taxes as well as government spending as <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with technology shocks once the monetary policy instrument as been given up as part of monetary union. We find that, with empirically plausible degrees of price and wage-stickiness, joining a monetary union imposes significant welfare costs on an economy’s inhabitants when that economy is subject to technology shocks. These costs could be reduced by up to half by utilising <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments,</b> with government spending being particularly effective in responding to idiosyncratic shocks due to its assumed home bias in the purchase of goods. However, even employing all three <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> could not reduce the costs of these shocks to the levels found when the economy stayed out of monetary union and retained use of a monetary policy (and therefore exchange rate) instrument. We also found that implementation lags could significantly affect the ability of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with shocks, but that the need to ensure fiscal solvency when utilising tax and spending instruments had negligible welfare consequences.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} the damage based tax mechanism to induce socially optimal outcomes in a controlled laboratory environment which incorporates important aspects of nonpoint pollution problems. Our experimental setting combines a strictly convex damage function with uncertainty in measuring the ambient level of pollution, indefinitely repeated interactions among heterogeneous polluters, limited information on the regulator's side about the polluters' profit functions, and, in half of the experimental conditions, limited information on the polluters' side about the strategic environment. We additionally investigate whether the relative position of the social optimum in the polluters’ emission space has an impact on the efficiency of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument.</b> In almost all implemented conditions, the observed total pollution level is not significantly different from the socially optimal level but compliance at the individual level is rarely observed. Experimental conditions in which polluters have to dramatically reduce their emissions in order to comply with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument</b> lead to higher efficiency levels than those where compliance implies less dramatic reductions. Our most striking result is that less information on the polluters' side is beneficial from a social point of view as the performance of the damage based tax mechanism is higher the less information polluters have about the strategic environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{the most}} pernicious {{economic}} institutions and policies create entry barriers or manipulate factor prices to transfer resources from entrepreneurs and workers to groups that hold political power. These inefficiencies partly result {{from the fact that}} direct and efficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> {{that can be used for}} taxation and redistribution of resources are absent. One might then conclude that increasing state capacity and expanding the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> should improve the allocation of resources by preventing the use of these inefficient, indirect methods of redistribution. This reasoning ignores the effect of greater state capacity and the change in the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> on the political equilibrium, however. Because the availability of more efficient means of taxation increases the potential benefits of controlling state power, it also intensifies costly political conflict aimed at capturing the control of the state. This indirect effect counteracts the benefits from more efficient taxation and may dominate the direct benefits. The paper establishes the possibility that the allocation of resources may deteriorate substantially in response to an autonomous increase in state capacity and the set of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> It also argues that in the British case, which is a key historical example that points to the central role of increased state capacity in economic development, this change was not autonomous; instead, it was an equilibrium response to changes in political institutions that placed better checks on the exercise of power by the executive. This reasoning suggests that the study of the effect of fiscal capacity and the evaluation of policies aimed at increasing state capacity in less-developed economies should be done in the context of dynamic models of political economy, in which fiscal capacity and political constraints are jointly determined. ...|$|E
