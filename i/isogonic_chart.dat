40|$|The {{study of}} the {{geomagnetic}} field began {{with the publication of}} the book De Magnete (1600) of Sir William Gilbert (1504 - 1603). By influence of Sir Edmund Halley the British Marine is obligated to make measurements of the declination of the magnetic field wherever theirs ships go. Thus, Sir Edward Belcher measured it at the Cocos Island on board of The British ship Sulphur on 3 of april 1838, it gave a value of 8 ° 23 ` 49 `` East. At the end of last century and {{at the beginning of this}} one, Henri Pittier did a sort of measurements of the magnetic declination of Costa Rica, thus allowing the publications of the first <b>isogonic</b> <b>chart</b> of Costa Rica for the year 1901. But it is not until 1965 when Gutiérrez Braun published a more actualized <b>isogonic</b> <b>chart.</b> In 1978 G. Leandro and J. Páez did the more sustained effort to get a detailed data of the magnetic field of Costa Rica, allowing the chart of 1978, actualized afterward by G. Leandro in 1984. El estudio del campo geomagnético se inicia con Sir William Gilbert (1540 - 1603) al publicar su libro De Magnete (1600). Por influencia de Sir Edmund Halley se abliga al almirantazgo inglés a que hagan medidas de la declinación magnética en sus viajes. Es por eso que Sir Edward Belcher de la nave británica Sulphur la determinó el 3 de abril de 1838 en la isla del Coco, con un valor de 8 ° 23 ` 49 `` Este. A finales del siglo XIX y principios de este, Henri Pittier realiza medidas de la declinación del campo magnético en el territorio de Costa Rica permitiendo publicar la primera carta isogónica correspondiente al año de 1901. No es sino hasta 1965 que Gutiérrez Braun publica una carta isogónica más actualizada. Pero en 1978 G. Leandro y J. Páez hacen el estudio más detallado del campo magnético de Costa Rica, permitiendo la carta para 1978 y actualizada después por G. Leandro en 1984...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{changes in}} magnetic declination in the Adriatic Sea {{from the first}} measurements in 1806 to the latest <b>isogonic</b> <b>charts</b> from 1995. The basis of analysis are data provided by the Adriatic pilot books as literature that mariners used as an indispensable instrument in sailing {{that has not been}} properly evaluated in the scientific research so far. It is emphasized the the magnetic declination was relevant primarily to overseas ferries, and was less important in coastal navigation, usually along the archipelagos of the eastern Adriatic maritime zone as terrestrial navigation was used in sailing in this belt with over a thousand islands and islets...|$|R
40|$|The Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (SCHA) is a {{regional}} modeling technique based on appropriate functions which are solutions of Laplace’s equation over a constrained, cap-like {{region of the}} Earth. The concept was introduced in 1985 {{in the context of}} geomagnetism as a local or regional extension of the classic global spherical harmonic analysis. Starting from the basic principles in which the analysis method is founded, this paper describes the latest applications for the modeling of the main magnetic field and its secular variation. Although examples of applications over small areas will be given, it will be shown that, in general, the bigger the region the more appropriate the technique. Therefore, this paper focuses on the results and perspectives over continental areas, like Antarctica or Europe. The possible application to the derivation of <b>isogonic</b> <b>charts</b> for navigational purposes with suitable time predictions will be emphasized. At the same time, the limitations of the method will be examined. Although recent revisions of the technique seem to solve some of the problems, our present research focuses on the quest for solutions to the still unanswered questions...|$|R
