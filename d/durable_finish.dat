50|$|The 'fad' {{is often}} {{lubricated}} with an oil that then becomes {{integrated into the}} overall finish. This helps to prevent the 'fad' from lifting previously applied layers of shellac. Typically, softer/ thinner oils such as mineral oil will produce a glossier though less <b>durable</b> <b>finish</b> whereas harder/ more viscous oils such as walnut oil and olive oil will produce a more <b>durable</b> <b>finish.</b> Although boiled linseed oil is commonly used as a wood treatment, it is too viscous to use for French polishing.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 30 - 31) Newly <b>finished</b> <b>durable</b> press fabrics {{have been}} shown to have a bacteriostatic agent as a constituent of the finish. It has not been shown what happens to the antibacterial constituent after prolonged storage or periods of laundering. This study investigated the hypotheses that the bacteriostatic effects of <b>durable</b> press <b>finishes</b> are dissipated during prolonged storage a:nd that laundering of fabrics removes any residual bacteriostatic effect present as a result of application of <b>durable</b> press <b>finishes.</b> Two types of bacteria were used. One, Escherichiacoli, represents a gram-negative bacteria and the other, Bacillus megaterium represents a gram-positive bacteria. Fabric blends composed of cellulose and polyester and <b>finished</b> with a <b>durable</b> press <b>finish</b> were the objects of the experiment. The fabric had been stored in a dark, closed area in a laboratory for eight months. Control samples were held and test samples were laundered to check th eeffect of laundering. Subsequent laundry periods were given the fabric to obtain samples which rep resented two, seven, twelve, twenty-two, and thirty-two launderings. See more in text...|$|R
50|$|After the steek is cut, {{the edges}} are tacked {{down on the}} wrong side of the fabric in order to create a neat finishing, or the {{adjacent}} stitches are sewn or crocheted together to prevent unraveling. The stitches can also be picked up and knit from, for example, to create a sleeve. Alternatively, a sleeve can be made separately and sewn onto the steek.

40|$|Severe tensile {{strength}} loss and poor abrasion resistance {{have been the}} major disadvantages for <b>durable</b> press <b>finished</b> 100 % cotton fabrics.

Based on the understanding of the mechanism, {{we will be able to}} reach the final objective of optimizing the strength retention and improving the performance of <b>durable</b> press <b>finished</b> cotton fabrics and garments. The tensile strength of <b>durable</b> press <b>finished</b> cotton fabrics is significantly reduced as a result of the crosslinking process. In this research, we investigated the effects of acid degradation and crosslinking of cellulose on the mechanical strength of the cotton fabric crosslinked with polycarboxylic acids, and evaluated various factors influencing the mechanical strength of <b>durable</b> press <b>finished</b> cotton fabrics. The strength loss caused by acid degradation is irreversible. The magnitude of fabric strength loss is affected by the temperature and time of the exposure, the concentration of the acid applied to the fabric, the dissociation constant of the acid, and the pH of the acid solution applied to the fabric. Crosslinking of cellulose with a polycarboxylic acid causes a reversible loss in fabric strength. The magnitude of the fabric strength loss increases as the degree of crosslinking increases. In order to optimize the mechanical strength of crosslinked cotton fabrics, it is necessary to minimize the acid-catalyzed depolymerization by controlling the finish bath pH and the curing conditions.

50|$|Urushiol-based {{lacquers}} {{differ from}} most others, being slow-drying, and set by oxidation and polymerization, {{rather than by}} evaporation alone. In order for it to set properly it requires a humid and warm environment. The phenols oxidize and polymerize under the action of an enzyme laccase, yielding a substrate that, upon proper evaporation of its water content, is hard. These lacquers produce very hard, <b>durable</b> <b>finishes</b> that are both beautiful and very resistant to damage by water, acid, alkali or abrasion. The active ingredient of the resin is urushiol, a mixture of various phenols suspended in water, plus a few proteins. The resin is derived from a tree indigenous to China, species Toxicodendron vernicifluum, {{commonly known as the}} Lacquer Tree. The fresh resin from the T. vernicifluum trees causes urushiol-induced contact dermatitis and great care is required in its use. The Chinese treated the allergic reaction with crushed shellfish, which supposedly prevents lacquer from drying properly. Lacquer skills became very highly developed in Asia, and many highly decorated pieces were produced.|$|R
50|$|These {{lacquers}} {{are also}} used on wooden products, furniture primarily, and on musical instruments and other objects. Nitrocellulose lacquers {{are also used}} to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of lacquer dissolves some of the previous coat. These lacquers were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in colour retention. The preferred method of applying quick-drying lacquers is by spraying, {{and the development of}} nitrocellulose lacquers led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose lacquers produce a hard yet flexible, <b>durable</b> <b>finish</b> that can be polished to a high sheen. Drawbacks of these lacquers include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. Lacquer grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since at this point, the lacquer has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.|$|E
30|$|Silver kills {{bacteria}} by strangling {{them in a}} {{warm and}} moist environment. Highly bioactive silver ions bind with proteins inside and outside bacterial cell membranes thus inhibiting cell respiration and reproduction. Silver is {{three to four times}} more active at pH 8 than at pH 6. Silver products are effective against bacteria but not as effective against other organisms like fungi, mould and mildew; they can be used with polyester where many other products cannot. Alginate and chitosan have also been used to make novel antimicrobial materials in combination with silver. Various techniques have been explored to attach silver to textile materials. To prepare antimicrobial fabrics suitable for sterilisation of air, cellulose was grafted with acrylic acid and treated with silver nitrate to bind the silver ions to the COOH group of graft copolymer. To develop a <b>durable</b> <b>finish</b> on wool, it was treated with a complexing agent such as tannic acid or ethylene diaminetetraaceticdianhydride. Thus, treated wool can react easily with copper and silver and inhibit the propagation of S. aureus and intestinal bacteria effectively. Deposition or interstitial precipitation of tetrasilver tetroxide crystals within the interstices of fibres, yarns and/or fabrics has also been reported in a US patent[17, 18, 19, 20, 21].|$|E

Thus, the necessity of imparting <b>durable</b> fragrance <b>finishing</b> with the consideration of its influence {{on the performance of}} the treated cotton is immensely vital.|$|R
40|$|<b>Durable</b> press <b>finishing</b> {{processes}} are generally {{used in the}} textile industry to produce wrinkle-free fabrics and garments. A <b>durable</b> press <b>finishing</b> agent forms covalent bonds with cellulosic hydroxyl groups, thus crosslinking the cellulose molecules. The cross linking of cellulose increase creases resistance of treated fabrics, {{and in the case}} of cotton, reduces its strength. Crease recovery angle (CRA) and tensile strength are the two most important parameters which are used to evaluate the performance of the crosslinked cellulosic fabrics and garments. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMDHEU resin on the crosslinking of cotton, bamboo, tencel and viscose fabrics. Three levels of resin concentration and four levels of curing temperature were employed for crosslinking treatments. The curing time was kept at 4 min in all the cases. The results show that the crease recovery angle has improved in all the cases and the improvement was found to be excellent for viscose, With the exception of cotton, in all the other cases, the tensile strength was unchanged. Thus resin treatment is strongly recommended for bamboo, viscose and tencel fabrics as it is found to improve wrinkle resistance without causing any deterioration in strength...|$|R
5000|$|Primer is a paint {{product that}} allows {{finishing}} paint to adhere {{much better than}} if it were used alone. [...] For this purpose, primer is designed to adhere to surfaces and to form a binding layer that is better prepared to receive the paint. Because primers {{do not need to}} be engineered to form a <b>durable</b> <b>finished</b> surface, they can instead be engineered to have improved filling and binding properties with the material underneath. Sometimes this is achieved by chemistry, as in the case of aluminium primer, but more often this is achieved through controlling the primer's physical properties, such as porosity, tackiness, and hygroscopy. In practice primer is often used when painting many kinds of porous materials, such as concrete and especially wood (see detailed description below). Priming is mandatory if the material is not water resistant and will be exposed to the elements. Priming gypsum board (drywall) is also standard practice with new construction because it seals the wall and aids in preventing mold. Primers can also be used for dirty surfaces which cannot be cleaned, or before painting light colors over existing dark colors.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{the study of the}} surface {{modification}} of cotton fibers to confer hydro and oil repellency to the fabrics. A surface treatment not involving the bulk of the fibers was chosen, so fabrics can maintain comfort properties. Moreover the study focused on an economical and environmental friendly process, in order to obtain an effective treatment with good fastness to washing. A modified silica based film was applied on fibers surface by sol-gel, comparing laboratory grade reagents with a commercial product as precursors and optimizing process parameters. From obtained results sol-gel can be indicated as a promising process to confer an effective and <b>durable</b> <b>finishing</b> to cotton fibers with low add-ons. Long impregnation times can significantly improve the treatment fastness, while ironing the washed samples can restore, at least partially, hydro and oil repellency lost after the washing. Obtained results were supported by a deep surface characterization of untreated, treated and washed samples. The best results were obtained using the commercial product as the only precursor. This is interesting for an industrial application, due to the low cost of this product if compared with the laboratory grade reagents investigated. Some applications of finished textiles can be for household use, technical garments, umbrellas or outdoor textiles...|$|R
