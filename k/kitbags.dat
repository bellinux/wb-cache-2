5000|$|The {{fighting}} started prematurely {{when one}} of Hoare's men accidentally got in the [...] "something to declare" [...] line and the customs officer insisted on searching his bag. The rifles were well-concealed in the false-bottomed <b>kitbags</b> but the rifle was found and the customs man, running from the scene, sounded the alarm. One of Hoare's men pulled his own, disassembled AK-47 from the concealed compartment in the luggage, assembled it, loaded it and shot the escaping customs man before he could reach {{the other side of}} the building. The plan for the coup proceeded despite this set-back with one team of Hoare's men attempting to capture a barracks. Fighting ensued at the airport and in the middle of this, an Air India jet (Air India Boeing aircraft Flight 224), landed at the airport, damaging a flap on one of the trucks strewn on the runway. Hoare managed to negotiate a ceasefire before the aircraft and passengers were caught in the crossfire. After several hours, the mercenaries found themselves in an unfavorable position and some wanted to depart on the aircraft, which needed fuel. Hoare conceded and the captain of the aircraft allowed them on board after Hoare had found fuel for the aircraft. On board, Hoare asked the captain why he had landed when he had been informed of the fighting taking place and he responded that once the aircraft had started to descend, he did not have enough fuel to climb the aircraft back to cruising altitude and still make his destination.|$|E

40|$|Youth {{work is a}} {{distinct}} professional discipline that has clear parameters to its practice base. These parameters form the reference points for professional youth workers and are enshrined in the Victorian Youth Sector Code of Ethical Practice (Corney and Hoiles 2007). The parameters for youth work are underpinned by {{an understanding of the}} social, political and economic context in which young people live and operate (Maunders and Broadbent 1995). This article discusses a youth-work practice framework, using the analogy of a 'kitbag' that defines us as professionals and, more importantly, the distinct set of skills and knowledge that is called 'youth work'. Youth work has built up professional resources, including codes of ethical practices and a research body of knowledge, and has become a defined industry, with education and training and labour-market definitions. All of these, as well as a set of ethics, values, practice reference points, principles, knowledge and skills, should be contained in the <b>kitbag</b> of each professional youth worker and provided through training and mentoring. The analogy of a <b>kitbag</b> seems appropriate when referring to all of the tools that a professional may need. Interestingly, industry representatives used the term 'toolbox' in the past, based on similar connections to the need for tools in order to be successful in any profession. The establishment of what is included in the professional <b>kitbag</b> of youth work requires the sort of advocacy that is found in the strong collective voice of a professional association. Victoria has a history of attempts to establish a professional association to be that advocate. In recent times there has been yet another call to align the code of ethical practice with a professional association. With an increasing number of other professions scrambling over the youth worker's terrain, {{there seems to be a}} looming imperative for youth work to professionalise or perish...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} ethics {{is complex and}} contentious. For public {{relations}} it is also critical, as the industry will only win the struggle to salvage its own reputation if it can clearly demonstrate not only a commitment to ethics, but also some means to enforce ethical standards. There are many ethical reasoning tools, both intricate and useful, that public relations practitioners use {{to try to make}} ethical decisions, and these have been widely discussed in textbooks and specialist articles (e. g. Johnston & Zawawi, 2000; Bivins, 1992; Wright, 1989 a; Pratt, 1993; Kruckeberg, 1996). This article does not attempt a comprehensive overview of ethical schemas; rather, it takes one corner of the ethical practitioner’s <b>kitbag</b> of tools, the association code of conduct, and examines one aspect of code content; its stand on social duty. As practical ethics tools, codes clearly have strengths and weaknesses beyond their incorporation or otherwise of a specific ‘duty to society’ clause (c. f.

However, this article suggests that the absence or flimsiness of such clauses in some of the world’s leading PR association codes is too important a weakness to pass without comment. This article is intended not as a definitive word on ethics code requirements, nor an overview of their effectiveness and enforcement, but rather as a means to ensure that the important debate about ethics continues...|$|R
