5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Parcells had grown restless as coach of the Giants and yearned for {{complete}} control of the team. Knowing that he would not <b>get</b> <b>that</b> opportunity with George Young as GM, Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|After {{a longer}} hiatus, Rodman {{returned}} {{to play basketball}} for the Long Beach Jam of the newly formed American Basketball Association during the 2003–04 season, with hopes of being called up to the NBA midseason. While he did not <b>get</b> <b>that</b> wish that season, he did help the Jam win the ABA championship in their inaugural season. He also played in Mexico, with Fuerza Regia in 2004. In the following 2004–05 season, he signed with the ABA's Orange County Crush and the following season with the league's Tijuana Dragons. In November 2005, he played one match for Torpan Pojat of the Finland's basketball league, Korisliiga.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will <b>get</b> <b>that</b> piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

To {{go out there and}} face one of the best pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people <b>get</b> <b>that</b> out of it.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and <b>get</b> <b>that</b> vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Shelley {{worked in}} Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then {{returned}} to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore. It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore. Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships; {{he wrote a book}} entitled How to Interview Well and <b>Get</b> <b>that</b> Job! (2004). For service to the people of Singapore, the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) on him in 1978, awarding an additional Bar the following year.|$|E

Despite Peugeot's sportscar racing program, the company is not prepared to build a pure sportscar any more hardcore than the RC Z sports-coupe.

25|$|Born in Rutherglen, Bryson {{began his}} career with non-league side Westwood Rovers. He signed a {{professional}} contract with Scottish First Division club Clyde {{at the beginning of}} the 2003–04 season. He turned down the opportunity to sign for Scottish Premiership club Motherwell because he wanted to play regular first team football and he didn't feel that he would <b>get</b> <b>that</b> at Motherwell. He didn't make a first team appearance that season, but was loaned out to junior outfit East Kilbride Thistle for the latter part of the season. He made a big impression in his time at East Kilbride, scoring two goals in eight league appearances and winning the club's Young Player of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return for a man of his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even <b>get</b> <b>that</b> chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E
25|$|Ryan {{signed a}} lucrative free-agent {{contract}} with the Houston Astros after the 1979 season. The normally light-hitting Ryan got his Houston years started with a bang in a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 12, 1980, when he hit a three-run home run off Don Sutton. It {{was the first of}} two homers in Ryan's career and produced half of the six RBI he would <b>get</b> <b>that</b> year. On July 4 of that season, at Riverfront Stadium, Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being César Gerónimo of the Cincinnati Reds (Gerónimo had also been Bob Gibson's 3,000th strikeout victim, in 1974). Ryan got his third taste of postseason play in 1980, but the Astros were stopped one game short of the World Series.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem with}} clutch hitting {{is that some}} people {{interpret}} it as always <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> big hit in a critical situation, while {{the reality is that}} it is unreasonable to think a player can get a hit each time out.

No one remembers a poor batting average in a series where a player hits a game-winning home run.|$|R
