500|$|For the 1981 season, Ferrari {{introduced}} {{their first}} turbo engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve [...] "had a little family [...] {{but he made}} me welcome and made me feel at home overnight... treated me as an equal in every way." [...] Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him {{for most of the}} race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: [...] "That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> that car was." [...] At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being black flagged but eventually the wing became detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.|$|E

During a WWE house show in Munich, Germany early in June 2004, {{in an attempt to}} draw heel heat, he gave the crowd several Nazi salutes while goose-stepping around the ring. Such a display is illegal in Germany, and CNBC fired Layfield {{as a result of the}} controversy. In an {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Layfield explained [...] "I'm a bad guy [...] I'm supposed to incite the crowd. I've done it for decades. I really didn't think anything of – I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> it is, I've lived [...] I've been to Dachau, seen those places where they exterminated millions of Jews. I draw the line between me and my character. That's like saying Anthony Hopkins (who portrays Hannibal Lecter) really enjoys cannibalism".|$|E

He also managed burlesque shows.Willie Hammerstein managed his father's Olympia Theater, which opened in 1895.In November 1896 Willie Hammerstein brought the Cherry Sisters to the Olympia roof garden.

He provided a net that protected them when the audience, as expected, started throwing produce and garbage at the stage. The word spread, and the sisters became a big draw.|$|R
