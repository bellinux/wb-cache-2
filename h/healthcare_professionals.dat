5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E

This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{opportunities}} and barriers to appropriate employment for <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees in Finland. Moving beyond a simplistic dichotomy between employment and unemployment, this study seeks to identify the factors that, may inhibit, or potentially enhance, <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees' ability. to reestablish their careers in Finland. This research is built' on a notion that a strategy enabling more effective integration of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees'skills into the Finnish workforcecould benefit both refugees and Finnish society. Previous research suggests that a profession is often the main axi~ of highly educated refugees',identity, and being forced to abandon one's profession thus means a loss of identity {{as well as a}} loss of income and social statils. Although paid labour market participation is now widely recognised as one of the main factors _,hat facilitate, successful resettlement and social integration, the requirements set by the Finnish authorities make formal recognition ofoverseas qualifications difficult to achieve. In the case of refugees, this problem is exacerbated by the 'victimisation' of refugees and integration practices that do not meet the needs of highly educated refugees. Approaching the topic'from a constructivist standpoint, this thesis focuses on <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees' personal accounts of their experiences. In addition to 13 interviews with <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees, 10 interviews were conducted with key respondents from relevant professional associations and the institutional sector. The findings suggest that <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees' skills remain largely underutilised. An examination of the effects of different inhibiting and enhancing factors on <b>healthcare</b> <b>professional</b> refugees' career prospects in Finland indicates that the positive effects ofthe enhancing factors are effectively outweighed by the inhibiting factors. While an established qualification recognition procedure makes it possible for refugee doctors to obtain official recognition for their overseas qualifications, the training that is intended to prepare them for the examinations is inadequate. _In the absence of a suitable qualification recognition-procedure, refugee nurses are commonly advised to forget their aspirations of returning to nursing, and encouraged to fe-educate themselves for the loweer) -paid pr~fession ofa healthcare assistant.
