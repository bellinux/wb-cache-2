The frog's hideous large eyes were goggling {{out of his head}} in a manner which appeared quite ridiculous to the old blackamoor, who watched the splay-footed slimy wretch with that peculiar grim humour belonging to crows.

60|$|It {{was a very}} {{different}} Sunday from those to which Henrietta had been accustomed, in the complete quiet and retirement of Rocksand. The Hall was so far from the church, that there was but just time to get back in time for evening service. After which, according to a practice of which she had often heard her mamma speak with many agreeable reminiscences, the Langford family almost always went in a body on a progress to the farmyard, to visit the <b>fatting</b> <b>oxen</b> and see the cows milked.|$|R

60|$|Whatever {{might be}} the {{ultimate}} designs of the Kafir--for such he was-- his intentions at the time being were evidently peaceful, for he carried neither weapon nor shield. He touched nothing belonging to the white men, though guns and blankets and other tempting objects were more than once within reach of his hand. Neither did he attempt to steal that which to the Kafir is the most coveted prize of all--a <b>fat</b> <b>ox.</b> Gradually he melted away into the darkness from which he had emerged. No eye in all the emigrant band saw him come or go in his snake-like glidings, yet his presence was known {{to one of the}} party--to Ruyter the Hottentot.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a low}} four-poster, {{shelving}} downward in {{the centre}} like a trough, {{and the room was}} crowded with impracticable tables and exploded chests of drawers, full of damp linen. A graphic representation in oil of a remarkably <b>fat</b> <b>ox</b> hung over the fireplace, and the portrait of some former landlord (who might have been the ox's brother, he was so like him) stared roundly in, {{at the foot of the}} bed. A variety of queer smells were partially quenched in the prevailing scent of very old lavender; and the window had not been opened for such a long space of time that it pleaded immemorial usage, and wouldn't come open now.|$|E
60|$|The hour of {{the feast}} drew on and, {{according}} to custom, it {{was held in the}} Temple, and thither went all men. When they were seated in the nave of the Hof, the <b>fat</b> <b>ox</b> that had been made ready for sacrifice was led in and dragged before the altar on which the holy fire burned. Now Asmund the Priest slew it, amid silence, before the figures of the Gods, and, catching its blood in the blood-bowl, sprinkled the altar and all the worshippers with the blood-twigs. Then the ox was cut up, and the figures of the almighty Gods were anointed with its molten fat and wiped with fair linen. Next the flesh was boiled in the cauldrons that were hung over fires lighted all down the nave, and the feast began.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} meals of the wealthier social class, as illustrated in the stories of Abraham and Sinuhe, was the more frequent consumption of meat. A description of the provisions for Solomon's kitchen also illustrates this: [...] "Solomon's daily provisions consisted of 30 kor of fine flour and 60 kor of flour, 10 <b>fat</b> <b>oxen,</b> 20 pasture-fed oxen, and 100 sheep and goats, in addition to deer and gazelles, roebucks and fattened geese" [...] (...) [...] This account describes the provisions that were possible to obtain for those with the resources to purchase them and indicates they were sufficient to provide sumptuous meals for thousands of people.|$|R
5000|$|Later, his Earl of Essex {{came back}} to the boards in a revival. Again, Samuel Johnson offered his public support of Brooke, but when he heard the Earl saying at the end of Act II, [...] "Who rules o'er free men must himself be free," [...] Johnson replied, [...] "Who drives <b>fat</b> <b>oxen</b> must himself be fat." [...] Although Johnson was objecting to the misuse and overuse of [...] "freedom" [...] and was at that time in a {{vexatious}} debate over the United States War of Independence (saying, [...] "Why is it that we hear the loudest cries for liberty from the drivers of Negroes?"), Brooke was mortified by Johnson's parody and changed the line for his Collected Works.|$|R

There's no non sequitur, I think, in that, [...] And this is logic plain as a, b, c. Now, Hector Stuart, you're a Scottish prince, [...] If right you fathom your descent--that fall From grace; {{and since you}} have no peers, and since [...] You have no kind of nobleness at all, 'Twere better to sing little, lest you wince [...] When made by heartless critics to sing small.

60|$|Near the king's throne (though I {{had no time}} to {{tell you}} so before) stood his {{daughter}} Ariadne. She was a beautiful and tender-hearted maiden, and looked at these poor doomed captives with very different feelings from those of the iron-breasted King Minos. She really wept indeed, at the idea of how much human happiness would be needlessly thrown away, by giving so many young people, in the first bloom and rose blossom of their lives, to be eaten up by a creature who, no doubt, would have preferred a <b>fat</b> <b>ox,</b> or even a large pig, to the plumpest of them. And when she beheld the brave, spirited figure of Prince Theseus bearing himself so calmly in his terrible peril, she grew a hundred times more pitiful than before. As the guards were taking him away, she flung herself at the king's feet, and besought him to set all the captives free, and especially this one young man.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the country}} through which we were passing is good game-veldt, but we saw very little and killed nothing. This was chiefly owing {{to the fact that}} we did not dare go out of hearing of the waggon-wheels, for fear of getting lost in the bush, a thing very easily done. A few years back this veldt swarmed with big game, with {{elephants}} and giraffes, and they are even now occasionally seen. We managed now and again to get a glimpse of some of the beautiful [...] "Impala" [...] buck, or of a small lot of blue wilderbeestes vanishing between the trees, like a troop of wild horses. There are still plenty of lions about, but we did not hear any: whether it was that they had gone to the high-veldt after the cattle, or that they do not roar so much in summer, I do not know. Perhaps it is as well that we did not, for the roar of a lion is very generally followed by what the Dutch call a [...] "skrech." [...] After roaring once or twice to wake the cattle up, and make them generally uneasy, the lion stations himself about twenty yards to the windward of the waggon. The oxen get wind of him and promptly [...] "skrech," [...] that is, break their rims and run madly into the veldt. This is just what the lion wants, for now he can pick out a <b>fat</b> <b>ox</b> and quietly approach him from the other side till he is within springing distance. He then jumps upon him, crushes his neck with one bite, and eats him at his leisure.|$|E

60|$|I should reply, that {{to expect}} to profit by other men's discoveries when you do not pay for them--to let others labour {{in the hope of}} {{entering}} into their labours, is not a very noble or generous state of mind--comparable somewhat, I should say, to that of the <b>fatting</b> <b>ox,</b> who willingly allows the farmer to house him, till for him, feed him, provided only he himself may lounge in his stall, and eat, and NOT be thankful. There is one difference in the two cases, but only one-- that while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox, the scientific man cannot repay himself by eating you; and so never gets paid, in most cases, at all.|$|R
60|$|There are {{few things}} {{in this world that}} have filled me with so much astonishment as the fact that man can kill a whale! That a fish, more than sixty feet long, and thirty feet round the body; with the bulk of three hundred <b>fat</b> <b>oxen</b> rolled into one; with the {{strength}} of many hundreds of horses; able to swim at a rate that would carry it right round the world in twenty-three days; that can smash a boat to atoms with one slap of its tail, and stave in the planks of a ship with one blow of its thick skull;--that such a monster can be caught and killed by man, is most wonderful to hear of, but I can tell from experience that it is much more wonderful to see.|$|R

2500|$|Khufu is {{depicted}} in several relief fragments found scattered in his necropolis and elsewhere. All reliefs were made of finely polished limestone. Some of them originate from the ruined pyramid temple and the destroyed causeway, where they once covered the walls completely. Others were found re-used in the pyramid necropolis of king Amenemhet I at Lisht and at Tanis and Bubastis. One of the relief fragments shows the cartouche of Khufu with the phrase: [...] "Building of the sanctuaries of the gods". Another one shows a row of <b>fat</b> <b>oxen</b> decorated with flowers – they were obviously prepared as sacrifices during an offering procession. The guiding inscription calls them [...] "the surroundings of Tefef serve Khufu", [...] "beautiful bulls of Khufu" [...] and [...] "bawling for Khufu". A third one shows the earliest known depiction of royal warfare: the scene is called [...] "archers prepare", since it shows archers drawing their bows. And a fourth example shows the king with the double crown impaling a hippopotamus.|$|R
