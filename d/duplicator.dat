25|$|The stencil <b>duplicator</b> or {{mimeograph}} {{machine is}} a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875.|$|E

25|$|When the Netherlands was {{occupied}} in World War II by Germany in May 1940 Van Norden {{and his group}} of friends decided on resisting the occupation forces. He, Nord, Carmiggelt and their families all lived in the Reguliersgracht in Amsterdam. In autumn 1940 he became involved in spreading the illegal Nieuwsbrief (English: Newsletter) of Pieter 't Hart, the war pseudonym of Frans Goedhart. In 1941 he became contributing editor to the newsletter after being invited by Goedhart. Van Norden also worked on the <b>duplicator</b> which produced the stencils on which the newsletter was made.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control <b>duplicator</b> because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E
50|$|Mimeographs, {{along with}} spirit <b>duplicators</b> and hectographs, were a common {{technology}} in printing small quantities, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins. Early fanzines were printed with this technology, {{because it was}} widespread and cheap. In the late 1960s, mimeographs, spirit <b>duplicators,</b> and hectographs began to be gradually displaced by photocopying.|$|R

500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image <b>Duplicator</b> (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E
500|$|The {{stories in}} Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories, {{but they were}} only {{occasionally}} science fiction, as {{in many cases the}} science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, [...] "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by Arthur B. Reeve, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. [...] The murderer in [...] "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is [...] "The Perfect Counterfeit" [...] by Captain S.P. Meek, in which a matter <b>duplicator</b> has been used to counterfeit paper money. [...] Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, The Bishop Murder Case, began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since the hardcover edition of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. [...] It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science: most of Scientific Detective Monthlys contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. [...] The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.|$|E

He takes a <b>duplicator</b> ray to Earth and makes Bizarro duplicates of Wonder Woman (referred to as Bizarro Wonder Woman), Firestorm and Cyborg. Planning on taking them back to protect Bizarro World, Mister Mxyzptlk convinces Bizarro to train his new friends on Earth, which causes havoc for the real Super Powers Team.|$|E

Near {{the end of the war}} in 1945 the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. Plates for this note were completed in Manila shortly before U.S. troops entered the city on 3 February 1945, and the Japanese printed the 1,000 Pesos note while they were retreating from Manila to Baguio.
