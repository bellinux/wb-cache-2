According to Bede, Ealdbeorht I was Bishop of Dommoc and Headulacus Bishop of Elmham in 731, but by 746 or 747, Heardred (II) had replaced Aldberct.|$|E
5|$|El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290–1342) {{imported}} {{and bred}} numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm record {{was made of}} his purchases describing many of the horses {{as well as their}} abilities, and was deposited in <b>his</b> <b>library,</b> becoming a source for later study. Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, to Americans.|$|E
5|$|Griswold's {{funeral was}} held on August 30. His pallbearers {{included}} Leland, Charles Frederick Briggs, George Henry Moore, and Richard Henry Stoddard.

5|$|John Sigismund {{had made}} his last {{testament}} and will {{in the presence of}} Chancellor Mihály Csáky and Treasurer Gáspár Bekes during his earlier illness in the summer of 1567. Despite his recovery, he did not alter the text in the following years. He willed most of his wealth to his uncle, Sigismund August of Poland, and his three aunts, Sophia, Anna and Catherine. He bequeathed <b>his</b> <b>library</b> to the Protestant school of Gyulafehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Professor Kilian Stobæus, natural scientist, {{physician}} and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, {{as well as}} the use of <b>his</b> <b>library,</b> which included many books about botany.

5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering {{the structure of}} <b>his</b> <b>library</b> soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} <b>his</b> <b>library</b> on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Owsley {{taught at}} a country school, and in 1803, he married Elizabeth Gill, {{one of his}} students. Gill was almost seventeen; Owsley was twenty-one. The couple had six children. During his time as a teacher, Owsley also studied {{surveying}} and eventually became a deputy surveyor. Later, {{he served as a}} deputy sheriff under his father, who was High Sheriff of Lincoln County. While in this capacity, he attracted the attention of John Boyle, who offered Owsley the use of <b>his</b> <b>library.</b> Owsley availed himself of this opportunity, and read law with Boyle. In 1809, Owsley opened a legal practice in Garrard County.|$|E

5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost <b>his</b> <b>library</b> and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Further {{material}} was {{gleaned from the}} De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt…), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist. Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in <b>his</b> <b>library,</b> no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E
5|$|Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. Following {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His {{departure}} on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and <b>his</b> <b>library</b> of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>library</b> and {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved <b>his</b> <b>library</b> and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E
5|$|Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American {{librarian}} and self-declared reformer. He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for <b>his</b> <b>library</b> classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E

5|$|Sorting out his affairs, Childe donated most of <b>his</b> <b>library</b> {{and all of}} {{his estate}} to the Institute. After a holiday visiting archaeological sites in Gibraltar and Spain in February 1957, he sailed to Australia, {{reaching}} Sydney on his 65th birthday. Here, the University of Sydney, which had once barred him from working there, awarded him an honorary degree. Travelling around the country for six months, visiting family members and old friends, he was unimpressed by Australian society, believing it reactionary, increasingly suburban and uneducated. Looking into Australian prehistory, he found it a lucrative field for research, and lectured to archaeological and leftist groups on this and other topics, taking to Australian radio to attack academic racism towards Indigenous Australians.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} for {{the book}} stayed in the White family until 1895, when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The purchaser was Stuart M. Samuel, who mounted the letters and bound the book in green Morocco leather. <b>His</b> <b>library</b> was sold in 1907. The manuscript was bought by the dealer A.S.W. Rosenbach in 1923, and passed into the collection of Arthur A. Houghton. The Houghton collection was auctioned by Christie's in 1980, where the manuscript was purchased by and for Gilbert White's museum at The Wakes, Selborne, where it is displayed.|$|E
5|$|To avert the {{collapse}} of Moore & Schley, Morgan called an emergency conference at <b>his</b> <b>library</b> Saturday morning. A proposal was made that the U.S. Steel Corporation, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of Andrew Carnegie and Elbert Gary, would acquire TC This would effectively save Moore & Schley and avert the crisis. The executives and board of U.S. Steel studied the situation and offered to either loan Moore & Schley $5 million, or buy TC for $90 a share. By 7 p.m. an agreement had not been reached and the meeting adjourned.|$|E
