His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E

It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't want no money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I think that for a long time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E

Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: [...] "They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night.

The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
