40|$|Emergency rescues {{require that}} first {{responders}} provide support to evacuate injured and other civilians who are obstructed by the hazards. In this case, the <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> can take actions strategically {{in order to}} rescue people maximally, efficiently and quickly. The paper studies {{the effectiveness of a}} random neural network (RNN) -based task assignment algorithm involving optimally matching <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> and injured civilians, so that the <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> can aid trapped people to move towards evacuation exits in real-time. The evaluations are run on a decision support evacuation system using the Distributed Building Evacuation Simulator (DBES) multi-agent platform in various emergency scenarios. The simulation results indicate that the RNN-based task assignment algorithm provides a near-optimal solution to resource allocation problems, which avoids resource wastage and improves the efficiency of the emergency rescue process...|$|R

40|$|Copyright 2008 Elsevier B. V., All rights reserved. This {{research}} paper provides {{an analysis of}} humour expression as a primary coping mechanism by <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> involved in sudden deathwork in the accident and emergency environment. For a number of decades, the expression of humour has been of interest to philosophers, social psychologists, sociologists, and social anthropologists. More recently the subject {{captured the attention of}} researchers of the service professions particularly, in relation to the beneficial expression of humour by <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel.</b> The research took place in accident and emergency departments at hospitals in the North of England. Nine focus groups were conducted on three sets of nurses in three accident and emergency departments, three groups of paramedics at their respective hospital ambulance station, and three groups of traffic officers from one Constabulary covering the geographical area of the three hospitals. The results identified seven themes containing examples of the expression of humour in sudden death encounters from everyday practice. The discussion explains how sudden death has become an existential problem generating societal fears about mortality, decay, and decomposition, which impact on how <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> feel about and handle the sudden death aspect of their role. The value of humour as a stress reducing mechanism is recognized by <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> and acknowledged as a normalizing characteristic of emergency care culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{doctoral thesis}} provides an ethnographic account of sudden deathwork performed by <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel.</b> The study centres on three accident and emergency {{departments in the}} North East of England. Sudden death practices and perceptions are revealed using thick description from focus groups, narratives and informant accounts. Three emergency disciplines: accident and emergency nurses, police traffic officers and paramedics provide the backdrop to describing three sudden death trajectories, which take the dead body from a state of collapse to a mortuary. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the significance of status passage as a temporal dimension of deathwork with due consideration being given to the concept of body handling as 'dirty work'. A feminist concept of embodiment challenges the dominant discourse of the death processing industry in relation to beneficence and non- maleficence for those who are left behind to grieve. The theatrical representation of the body to relatives is discussed within a dramaturgical frame, questioning what is appropriate and achievable within the boundaries of an emergency care environment. An exploration of the roles of <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> illuminates problems of dealing with a phenomenon, which annihilates the possibility of a sense of order and emotionally incapacitates <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel.</b> The procedural base to sudden death is presented through accounts of <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> contact with human suffering and emotional pain with the intention to build a substantive theory of a sudden death milieu. Finally, Schutzian relevances highlight key concepts of significance within the data demonstrating how, despite an evidence-base to practice, some myths are highly influential in shaping the behaviours of <b>emergency</b> <b>personnel</b> throughout the sudden death event. It is hoped that insight gained may provide a catalyst to inform change where needed, in service provision and enhance interprofessional working relationships...|$|R
