500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.".

2500|$|This was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iceberg. A {{group of}} fundamentalists {{began to develop}} a world view of {{creation}} based on the story in Genesis in the Holy Bible. The creationists rejected {{the notion of a}} 5 billion year old Earth, instead claiming that biological life began approximately five to six thousand years ago. One of the forceful voices in the creation science movement was Henry Morris. In an article published in the American Biology Teacher, he set out the differences, from his point of view, between the creation model and the evolution model. Essentially the creationists [...] "theorized" [...] that all living things were brought about by the acts of a Creator. The evolutionary model proposed that all living things were brought about by naturalistic processes due to properties inherent in inanimate matter. The creationists, in their literature, set the creation model alongside the evolutionary model, and insisted that good science education would provide alternative views on the same topic, and let the students evaluate them to form their own position.|$|E

2500|$|Adrian Ballinger and Cory Richards were {{sponsored}} by Eddie Bauer to climb Everest, and they relayed {{information from the}} Everest climb using the smartphone software application and service Snapchat. Mount Everest has had a 3G wireless data communication network since 2010. One {{of the things that}} was reported by them, was that bottled oxygen was stolen from them and there was some bad behaviour up there. The bottled oxygen was there for emergency back-up if they ran into trouble. Cory Richards summited Mount Everest without oxygen and returned safely, and Adrian made it almost to the top also. Another famous mountaineer, British climber Kenton Cool achieved his 12th Everest summit (the second-highest number of Everest summitings for a foreigner after Dave Hahn), and US celebrity mountaineer Melissa Arnot, completed her sixth summit, and achieved her personal goal of climbing Everest without supplementary bottled oxygen. This also turned out to be the most summits for a foreign female (not Nepali or Chinese), and one of the first US women to summit and survive without supplementary oxygen. In 1998 Francys Arsentiev had made it to the summit, but died during the descent; she went on to become a famous corpse as a landmark known as [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] until she was buried on Everest in 2007 by one of the people who had tried to help her. Another woman from the Americas, the Ecuadorian woman Carla Perez also summited Mount Everest in 2016 without supplementary oxygen. Perez and Arnot became the fifth and sixth women to summit Everest without supplementary oxygen. There is an ongoing discussion about the use of extra bottled oxygen in mountaineering. Also at issue is Dexamethasone (Dex), which is valuable as a lifesaver as it reduces swelling in the brain if someone comes down with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). When American Bill Burke was interviewed for his attempt, he noted how one of his team members had overdosed on Dex, prompting a medical evacuation even as in his more recent expedition, someone had 25 doses of Dex. He also noted it was hard to argue against large supplies of Dex, due its life-saving properties against some types of altitude sickness, especially HACE. An example of a death in which Dex was implicated was Dr. Eberhard Schaaf in 2012 on Everest. Schaaf died on descent at the south summit from altitude sickness. It has a good reputation as a life saver, and is commonly given to Everest climbers for its ability to intervene in last desperate moments when altitude sickness sets in. For example, in the 2016 season Robert Gropel said he gave Dex to his wife (as reported by the Telegraph) in attempt to save her as they tried to descend Everest. Of course, Dex is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iceberg, with the UIAA noting the aforementioned dexamethasone, but also [...] acetazolamide (aka Diamox), amphetamine, and alcohol use; and another noted Diamox (acetazolamide) use among trekkers. It is not really a matter of some authorities being for or against medications, but awareness, as misuse can cause drug interactions and various side effects. [...] In particular it was noted that supplementary oxygen significantly lowers death rate on ultra-high altitude mountain climbing, and is generally not regulated as a drug, whereas the safe use of medications is less understood or even acknowledged in many cases. (see also: Effects of high altitude on humans) ...|$|E
