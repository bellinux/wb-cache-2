25|$|This {{method of}} {{detonation}} produces energies over 100keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable {{not only for}} nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D–D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved {{to be in a}} predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3–6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the <b>detonation</b> <b>wave</b> at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The <b>detonation</b> <b>wave</b> in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases, focuses {{at the center of the}} hemisphere (50microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high-density plasma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Continuing {{the program}} {{initiated}} by Humpherys, Lyng, & Zumbrun [17] for strong <b>detonation</b> <b>waves,</b> {{we use a}} combination of analytical and numerical Evans-function techniques to analyze the spectral stability of weak <b>detonation</b> <b>waves</b> in a simplified model for gas-dynamical com-bustion. Combining these new spectral stability results with the pointwise Green function analysis of Lyng, Raoofi, Texier, & Zumbrun [22], we conclude that these waves are nonlinearly stable. The principal novelty of this analysis is the treatment of weak <b>detonation</b> <b>waves.</b> In contrast to the case of strong <b>detonation</b> <b>waves,</b> weak <b>detonation</b> <b>waves</b> are undercompressive and the stability of these waves is delicate and has not been treated by standard weighted-norm techniques. The present analysis thus provides a case study illustrating the flexibility and power of the Evans-function-based approach to stability.

Three types of stoichiometric test gases, C 2 H 4 + 3 O 2, 2 H 2 + O 2, and 2 C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 + 7 Ar, are evaluated.

The stabilized curved <b>detonation</b> <b>waves</b> eventually attain a specific curved shape as they propagate through the curved channels.

The propagation behavior of the stabilized curved <b>detonation</b> <b>waves</b> is controlled by the Dn/DCJ−λκ relation.
