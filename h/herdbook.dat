40|$|Pedigree {{collected}} by the Interbeef service allowed genetic diversity to be assessed by using pedigree analyses for the European Charolais (CHA) and Limousin (LIM) cattle populations registered in national <b>herdbooks</b> in Denmark (DNK), France (FRA), Ireland (IRL), Sweden (SWE), and, solely for the LIM breed, the United Kingdom (UK). The CHA data set included 2, 563, 189 calves with weaning performance, of which 96. 1 % were recorded in FRA, 3. 0 % in SWE, 0. 5 % in IRL, and 0. 4 % in DNK. The LIM data set included 1, 652, 734 calves with weaning performance, of which 91. 9 % were recorded in FRA, 4. 9 % in UK, 1. 8 % in DNK, 0. 9 % SWE, and 0. 5 % in IRL. Pedigree files included 3, 191, 132 CHA and 2, 409, 659 LIM animals. Gene flows were rather limited between populations, except from FRA toward other countries. Pedigree completeness was good in all subpopulations for both breeds and allowed the pedigree to {{be traced back to}} the French population. A relatively high level of genetic diversity was assessed in each CHA and LIM subpopulation by estimating either effective population sizes (Ne > 244 and Ne > 345 in the CHA and LIM subpopulations, respectively), relationship coefficients within subpopulations (< 1. 3 % in both breeds), or probability of gene origins. However, in each subpopulation, it was shown that founders and also ancestors had unbalanced genetic contributions, leading to a moderate but continuous reduction in genetic diversity. Analyses between populations suggested that all European CHA and LIM populations were differentiated very little. The Swedish CHA population was assessed as genetically more distant from the other CHA populations because of fewer gene flows from other countries and because of the use of North American sires to introgress the polled phenotype. In each European subpopulation, most of the main ancestors, which explained 50 % of gene origin, were born in FRA. However, those main ancestors were different between countries. Moreover, in both breeds, the main ancestors, which explained 50 % of the gene origin in DNK, IRL, SWE, and UK for the LIM breed, were found to be infrequently used in FRA. Those results were consistent with the low relationship coefficients estimated between subpopulations (< 0. 6 % in both the CHA and LIM breeds). Therefore, in both breeds, each subpopulation may constitute a reservoir of genetic diversity for the other ones...|$|R

To get the full text please contact the other Georg Erhardt and Christina WeimannBiotechnology has been part of human culture for a very long time. Farm animals of today ensure food and agriculture production and have mainly developed over thousands of years of domestication. They are the result of selection on the basis of phenotypic parameters by humans and adaptation to different environments and environmental challenges and represent genetically distinct species and breeds of different purposes within species. While breeding with the definition of breeds and <b>herdbooks</b> started in most species about 100 years ago, the consequent use of biotechnology began about 50 years ago with the introduction of artificial insemination. Major fields of biotechnology applied to animal production are further reproductive techniques, marker assisted selection including detection of deleterious alleles, genomic selection, and conservation of genetic resources. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer are important methods used in animal breeding, especially in cattle production to multiply the population of animals at a rapid rate. Both techniques are essential to improve the genetics of animals by having a high impact on selection intensity and accuracy and are usually implemented in breeding programs all over the world. Supporting methods such as embryo splitting/sexing, semen sexing, cloning and in vitro maturation have improved the efficiency of artificial insemination and embryo transfer, while transgenic farm animals do not exist on farm level. The implementation of molecular genetic methods in animal breeding resulted in remarkable advances {{over the last two decades}} in the identification of chromosomal regions and loci affecting economically important traits in livestock production. Basis for this were the advances in the availability of whole genome sequences and the identification of genetic variation on a large scale within international research projects. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology (SNPChip) has, in the meantime, enabled profiling animals for thousands of marker loci in a single analysis. This amount of information in combination with phenotypic records of the breeding organizations and with reproductive technologies supports high input breeding with a dramatic increase in the level of productivity. While this technology is already successfully used in breeding programs of breeds/species where the economic environment supports high input breeding, the situation for local breeds/species with at the moment less importance is difficult as they lack at the necessary infrastructure especially in developing countries and are declining in number. On the other hand, biotechnology is an effective tool that allows the characterization and conservation of animal genetic resources at risk of loss of genetic diversit...|$|R
