5|$|Videoball {{rules are}} fully customizable. Players choose from several color schemes, field layouts and patterns, {{and number of}} balls in play. They can also choose the time limit and allow for special scoring, in which special shots count as more than one point. The game is visualized in all solid, bright colors and basic shapes, and {{features}} voiceover announcers. <b>Games</b> <b>last</b> an average of four minutes, though they can last several times more.|$|E
5|$|<b>Games</b> <b>last</b> {{longer than}} their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in {{a football game}} {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|Football <b>games</b> <b>last</b> for a {{total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E

25|$|Six-a-side Cricket is a {{very short}} form of the sport {{designed}} to be played by teams of only six players. Each team receives one innings, with a maximum of only five overs. Naturally, with far fewer fielders, runs are much easier to score, and sixes matches are typically frenetic affairs. As the <b>games</b> <b>last</b> less than an hour, sixes cricket is typically played in a tournament format with multiple teams competing at the same ground.|$|E

He joined Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby and Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Ray Emery, who ranked as the Second and Third Stars, respectively. Stamkos had a season-high six-game goal streak, six multi-point outings and recorded at least one point in 11 of 14 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> month. He ended February on an eight-game point streak (seven goals and seven assists).|$|E
25|$|On September 17, 2015, the Lightning {{announced}} {{the signing of}} defenseman Daniel Walcott to a three-year, two-way contract. Walcott, skated in 54 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> season with Blainville-Boisbriand Armada of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, recording 7 goals and 41 points. He was first on the team among defensemen in goals, assists and points. He also appeared in six playoff games, recording a goal and four points. In his QMJHL career, he has appeared in 121 games, all with the Armada, collecting 17 goals and 80 points. He made his professional debut last season with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League on an ATO.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} for reintroducing the 15-man game to the Olympics is the 7-day {{turnaround}} required by World Rugby regulations for players to rest between games. Since the Olympics only officially run for 16 days, with only slight expansions allowed to accommodate {{sports such as}} football, this effectively {{makes it impossible to}} conduct a 15s tournament within the current Olympic schedule. This limitation does not apply to sevens, as <b>games</b> <b>last</b> only 14 minutes (20 in championship finals) instead of the 80 minutes in the 15s game. All of the events in the current men's and women's Sevens Series, which feature a minimum of 16 national teams for men and 12 for women, are conducted within a single weekend.|$|E

25|$|For a {{more direct}} comparison, matches in Twenty20 cricket, a form of limited overs cricket in which <b>games</b> <b>last</b> {{about the same time}} as a {{regulation}} baseball game, frequently produce combined run totals of 300 or more, with the all-time record being 469. Each run in a baseball game is roughly 75 times as important as a run in a Test cricket match (or 10–20 times the value of a cricketer scoring 4 or 6 runs off a single ball); therefore moments of poor pitching and individual fielding mistakes are much more costly. A baseball player who is a good batter but who is not a competent fielder will not play regularly, or only in the designated hitter position in leagues that use it.|$|E
25|$|Rugby seven {{teams have}} seven {{players on the}} field and can {{nominate}} five substitutes, but only three may play any one game. <b>Games</b> <b>last</b> for 14 minutes (7-minute halves) except for finals which can consist of two ten-minute halves. In international competitions there are two ingoal touch judges (one at each end) that assist the referee in determining successful shots at goal, touch in-goal and tries. Conversions are drop goals that must be taken within 40 seconds and the opposition must wait near the halfway. A player temporarily suspended must leave the game for two minutes. The scoring team restarts play by kicking off from the halfway. Free kicks are awarded to the opposition at the halfway if the ball does not travel ten metres, goes directly into touch or into the in-goal, or the kickers team are in front. Scrums are formed with three players.|$|E

500|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Using solely one analog stick and one button, players control triangles that shoot {{projectiles}} to knock a circular {{ball into the}} opposing team's endzone. Holding the button creates a projectile (a [...] "unit") that fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, nullify other projectiles, or incapacitate opponents. The projectile charges the longer the button is held, such that a charged [...] "slam" [...] shot can sail across the full screen. <b>Games</b> <b>last</b> an average of four minutes.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{discussion}} of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves, the role {{was assigned to}} Kelley. Agreeing to terms with George Dovey, president of the Doves, McGann played 135 games during the 1908 season, but batted only [...]240. During an April 1908 game between the Doves and the Giants, McGraw insulted McGann as slow, referring {{to him as a}} [...] "damned ice wagon", noting [...] "that's how the Giants lost a lot of <b>games</b> <b>last</b> season". After the game, McGann went to the Giants' hotel, waited for McGraw to return from the theatre, and fought him in a billiard room. Dovey released McGann from the Doves after the 1908 season.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954, {{he heard}} his minutes would be slashed, and after the second {{exhibition}} game, Pollard retired from the Eagles. As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally. He avoided the legal tangle by never officially signing with another team again, thus voiding the reserve clause on his contract. Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give me {{much of a chance}} to play... I carried the ball only 23 times in 12 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> year, so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four <b>games</b> <b>last</b> year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, like last year, PSU {{is a bit of a}} wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{free agent}} in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million {{contract}} with the Chicago White Sox. [...] "I looked at the different opportunities that I had {{and this was a}} team that won 83 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's {{going to be hard to}} replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E
500|$|Nutter {{started in}} the club's {{first game of the}} 2009–10 season; as Gillingham marked their return to the third tier of English {{football}} with a 5–0 victory over Swindon Town at Priestfield. He scored his only goal of the campaign, the second of his Gillingham career, in a 3–1 win over bottom-placed Stockport County in December 2009, marking his 100th appearance for the club with an [...] "angled volley" [...] that beat Owain Fôn Williams in the Stockport goal. Gillingham were relegated {{at the end of the}} season, finishing in 21st place. A 3–0 away loss to one of Nutter's former employers, Wycombe Wanderers, cemented their fate. Nutter made 41 appearances during the campaign. Stimson left the club by mutual consent days after the Wycombe match, and was replaced by Andy Hessenthaler. This meant that Nutter would be playing under a manager other than Stimson for the first time in six years (aside from a three-week spell under Peter Taylor at Stevenage). Nutter's contract was extended for a further year in June 2010 after he had [...] "played sufficient <b>games</b> <b>last</b> season to trigger a new deal". During the campaign, Nutter received the first red card of his career in a 2–0 home defeat to Dover Athletic in the FA Cup, earning the dismissal for a [...] "professional foul". He made 37 appearances during the 2010–11 season, scoring once, as Gillingham narrowly missed out on a play-off position. In May 2011, Nutter left Gillingham when his contract expired at the end of the month. During his three-and-a-half-year spell with the Kent side, he made 157 appearances and scored three goals.|$|E
