The rest of the remains, meanwhile, were turned over to the Burke Museum to be used for research purposes; the Burke owns the remains to the present day.|$|E

25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of <b>his</b> <b>cage,</b> and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E
500|$|Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) {{wakes up}} {{on the floor of a}} locker room. Tom (M.C. Gainey) allows her to have a shower and afterwards, forces her to change into a dress, after which she is led to an elegant breakfast on the beach with Ben, who tells her to put on {{handcuffs}} before she can eat. She asks him why he is doing this, and he tells her that he wanted to give her something pleasant to remember, as the next two weeks will be [...] "very unpleasant". James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) wakes up in a cage in the jungle. A teenager, Karl (Blake Bashoff), in a nearby cage initially ignores Sawyer but then later expresses interest in Sawyer's camp and unlocks <b>his</b> <b>cage</b> then Sawyer's. [...] However, they are both caught and Tom makes Karl, who is now beaten and bloody, apologize to Sawyer before taking the teen away. [...] Sawyer figures out the mechanical puzzle in <b>his</b> <b>cage,</b> though Tom says it [...] "only took the bears two hours." [...] Kate is then put in Karl's (now empty) cage.|$|E
5000|$|Goodfellow {{began his}} career as a {{wildlife}} collector by collecting specimens for museums, but later concentrated on capturing live birds for private aviaries. He took great care of <b>his</b> <b>caged</b> birds, often releasing those which appeared distressed, and refused to participate in the extensive trade in dead birds for women's fashions.

Limbo, a slave trader in captured humans, sees them but is taken prisoner to ensure his silence. General Thade and Colonel Attar march ape warriors in pursuit of the humans.

Sawyer realizes that the injury was inflicted by someone back at camp, and then devises a plan to break out from the cage; he intends to electrocute an off-guard Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) using a puddle he created outside <b>his</b> <b>cage.</b> However, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) overhears him via surveillance and switches off the electricity prior to visiting him. When Sawyer attempts {{to carry out his}} plan, Ben knocks him unconscious and has him carried into the [...] station.|$|E

Another tourist caught the event on tape. [...] Binky kept the woman's shoe for three days {{before it could be}} retrieved by zoo officials, and the day after the attack Alaska Star photographer Rob Layman took a photo of Binky, holding the shoe in his mouth, that was printed in almost every press account of the incident. Warburton gave the other shoe to the Bird House, a bar in nearby Bird Creek that has since burned down.|$|E
500|$|Jack is {{put into}} the bear cage, and notices a handcuffed Juliet being led to his old prison. She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become {{infected}} following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is {{in trouble with the}} Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' [...] "sheriff," [...] arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she can read the Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to <b>his</b> <b>cage.</b> Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying they are here to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from <b>his</b> <b>cage,</b> and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, [...] "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us". Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean {{considers}} that José {{is the central}} figure of the opera: [...] "It is his fate rather than Carmen's that interests us". The music characterizes his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, {{the result of his}} experiences as a prisoner, {{but it is clear that}} by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave <b>his</b> <b>cage</b> even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: [...] "He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} {{after only}} half a day's rehearsal and without a finished script; the actors received {{the rest of their}} lines in daily dispatches. According to Warren, [...] "dear old Max Cuff was {{trying to keep up with}} us. He was writing like mad." [...] Certain scenes were partly or wholly improvised: one example is a sex scene between the characters of Jessica and Jo, which was added mainly to boost the film's overseas distribution prospects. Many of the crew had recently come off the production of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, on which Marcel had served as assistant director. They completed an average of 35 camera set-ups per day, employing hand-held shots whenever they fell behind schedule and filming scenes in no more than three takes to lower costs. Stokes needed injections to ease the discomfort caused by the contact lenses that he was required to wear as part of his alien make-up. The bird Wally was a cockatoo that often refused to perform when needed and squawked loudly off-camera, frequently causing problems with the sound recording.
