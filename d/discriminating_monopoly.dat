40|$|A {{number of}} Joan Robinson's classic results on third-degree monopolistic price {{discrimination}} are generalized and extended. The relation between demand function curvature {{and the impact}} of monopolistic discrimination on total output is clarified in the general N-market case. It is shown that unless total output is increased sufficiently, monopolistic discrimination produces a net (Marshallian) efficiency loss. Qualifications necessary if discrimination allows new markets to be served are discussed. Under pure Pigouvian third-degree price discrimination, a monopolist maximizes profits by charging different prices to different markets or classes of customers, with no (second-degree discriminatory) bulk discounts or other nonlinear pricing allowed. The standard comparison of such conduct with that of a single-price monopoly remains that presented by Joan Robinson (Book V) almost a half-century ago. Using an algebraic approach, this note generalizes and extends some of her main results. Robinson (pp. 190 - 2) shows geometrically that if a single-price monop-oly selling in two markets under constant costs is allowed to discriminate between them, total output is unchanged if both markets have linear demand 1 curves. This result is easily extended to the N-market case below. If demand curves are not linear, she argues (pp. 192 - 5) that a comparison of their "adjusted concavities " at the nondiscriminating monopoly price deter-mines whether total output rises or falls. Her formal argument depends critically {{on the assumption that the}} <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly's</b> prices are nearly equal, however, and Melvin Greenhut and H. Ohta show by (non-pathological) example that her proposed test does not work when those prices differ substantially. The general relation between curvature of demand functions and total output changes due to monopolistic discrimination is analyzed below, Robinson's discussion of the welfare implications of discrimination (ch. 16) is very brief and informal, and it emphasizes equity as much as efficiency. Perhaps because of this, much of the subsequent literature seems to equate the efficiency effects of discrimination with its impact on total output. Basil Yamey uses a rather special example to argue that this equation is invalid; he asserts that in general the usua...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} model of {{discrimination}} {{in the market for}} mortgages. The model explains accepted loan applications and determines loan sizes and interest rates simultaneously. A competitive, and a <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> version of the model are proposed. O®ered interest rates and loan sizes are a function of observable borrower characteristics. The competitive model rests on a marginal condition, re°ecting contract optimality, to which a zero-pro¯t condition is added. In contrast, the <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> maximizes pro¯ts under a borrower participation constraint, re°ecting the availability of a rental market as an outside option. Each version of the model is a bivariate, nonlinear model, and is estimated by standard maximum likelihood methods. The data used for estimation is a sample of clients of a French network of mortgage lenders. We show the presence of "social discrimination " in the data, the loan conditions depending, not only on the borrower's wage and downpayment, but also on the borrower's occupational status. Abnormally high risk premia in the competitive version of the model suggest the presence of market power, justifying an attempt at estimating its monopolistic version.

The data distinguish establishments that have incremental wage scales with automatic progression by seniority. For unions with seniority scales, the union wage differential is increasing with seniority. This {{is not the case}} for unions without seniority scales. Taking account of this heterogeneity, the authors are able to reconcile previous paradoxical empirical findings. The results provide support for <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> models of the trade union and have important efficiency and distributional implications.

40|$|Based on the {{critical}} assumption of strategic complementarity, this paper builds a general model to describe and solve the screening problem faced by the monopolist seller of a network good. By applying monotone comparative static tools, we demonstrate that the joint presence of asymmetric information and positive network effects leads to a strict downward distortion for all consumers in the quantities provided. We also show that the equilibrium allocation is an increasing function of the intensity of network effects, and that a <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> may supply large quantities for all consumers than a competitive industry. network effects, strategic complementarities, contracting with externalities, second-degree discrimination, monotone comparative statics...|$|E
40|$|In {{standard}} durable-goods monopoly models, {{both the}} set of buyers and {{the set of}} prices {{are assumed to be}} continua. If the set of buyers is finite, the perfectly <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> outcome is a unique subgame perfect equilibrium when the seller is sufficiently patient. Introducing instead a smallest unit of account yields the Coasian outcome as a generically unique subgame perfect equilibrium for patient enough buyers. A folk theorem is obtained if both sets are finite. These results reflect a strategic disadvantage of having to make moves with a large impact on other players' payoffs. The analysis is extended to durable-goods oligopoly. Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{several decades}} {{up to the}} late 2000 s, the netback market pricing formula â which links gas prices (principally) to oil product prices â {{dominated}} international gas transactions in Europe. This type of price formation is consistent with charging different prices to different national markets, {{as well as to}} different end-use sectors within the same market, depending on: their location, the fuels which compete with gas in their energy markets, and their ability to access alternative gas supplies (which was severely limited prior to the introduction of liberalization and competition). The formula institutionalized the practice of <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> pricing â charging the highest possible price just short of a level which would cause customers to switch to other fuels and thereby maximizing the returns from sales to different markets â which was practised by all gas sellers (and European utility companies) prior to the arrival of competition...|$|E
40|$|The {{tradition}} that views Dupuit {{only as a}} brilliant engineer-economist who trained at the Ecole nationale des Ponts et Chaussees remained strong in the fifty years that followed World War II. Within this tradition, research on Dupuit mostly was focused on his publications on surplus theory, road tolls and <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly.</b> His participation in the debates about other issues taking place within the various learned societies to which he belonged (Societe d'economie politique de Paris, Societe d'economie sociale, Societe de statistique de Paris) long remained unexplored. But recent research has begun filling the gap. This paper follows on these latter research efforts. It aims at uncovering a largely unknown facet of Dupuit, endeavouring to fully elicit {{his role in the}} various controversies that took place in France between 1850 and 1866 on the issues of population and the Malthusian principle of population.

On {{the assumption that the}} fishermen's monopoly is able to discriminate between plants and end use alternatives in its pricing policy, the conditions for profit maximization are derived and compared with the conditions for social efficiency. It is found that the monopoly would be efficient if (I) its costs for obtaining the fish are identical to the social costs, (2) the marginal processing cost is constant, and (3) either the price of the finished product is constant or the product is exported so that consumer's surplus is {{not a part of the}} social benefit. A fishermen's monopoly may thus achieve the objectives of an export cartel. When the marginal processing cost is rising the monopoly will overconserve the fish resource, provided that its cost of providing the fish is not sufficiently below the social cost. Finally, the analysis is extended to the special case in which processors have established a price <b>discriminating</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the market for finished products but distribute the resulting profit through higher accounting prices while leaving individual processors to decide how much fish to buy for processing. This system passes the benefits from price discrimination in the markets for finished products on to the fishermen's monopoly.
