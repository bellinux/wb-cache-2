Different methods are being used for different <b>image</b> <b>noises</b> such as Wiener filter for Gaussian noise, Frost filter for speckle noise and median filter for impulse noise. LULU filters are widely being used for impulse noise too. LULU filters are nonlinear rank selector operators which are computationally more competent and the performance of the operator is straightforward to describe.

2500|$|In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also {{known as}} Gaussian smoothing) {{is the result}} of {{blurring}} an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, [...] typically to reduce <b>image</b> <b>noise</b> and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales—see scale space representation and scale space implementation.|$|E
2500|$|GEN-III OMNI-V - VII devices can {{differ from}} {{standard}} Generation 3 {{in one or}} both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions. The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the Standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less <b>image</b> <b>noise</b> and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2,850K of only 700, compared to operating with a luminous sensitivity of at least 1,800 for GEN III image intensifiers. [...] The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical 20,000 hrs mean time to failure (MTTF) for Gen III type, to 15,000 hrs MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach 15,000 hrs of operation before replacement.|$|E

40|$|Despite recent advances, robust {{automatic}} segmentation for vertebrae {{computed tomography}} (CT) image still presents considerable challenges, mainly {{due to its}} inherent limitations, such as topological variation, irregular boundaries (double boundary, weak boundary) and <b>image</b> <b>noises,</b> etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel automatically initialized level set approach based on region correlation, which is {{able to deal with}} these problems in the segmentation. First, an automatically initialized level set function (AILSF) is designed to automatically generate a smooth initial contour. This AILSF comprises hybrid morphological filter (HMF) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which can guarantee the initial contour precisely adjacent to the object boundary. Second, we introduce a region correlation based level set formulation, which simultaneously consider the histogram information of inside and outside the level set contour, to overcome the weak boundary leaking and <b>image</b> <b>noises</b> problem. Experimental results on clinical lumbar vertebrae CT images demonstrate that our proposed approach is more accurate in segmenting with irregular boundaries and more robust to different levels of salt-and-pepper noises.
