25|$|Shortly {{after the}} transfer, Grant began his {{campaign}} to capture Vicksburg and open the Mississippi River. After the initial failure of his traditional overland approach, he devised several plans aimed at bypassing the fixed defenses of the city. One of these {{became known as the}} Steele's Bayou Expedition. Mound City, now commanded by Lieutenant Commander Byron Wilson, {{was a member of a}} flotilla that attempted to reach the Yazoo River through a web of bayous, sloughs, creeks, and rivers. Porter himself accompanied the expedition and made the important decisions. Progress was slow because of the tight turns in the narrow streams, the trees that overhung the channels, and willow roots that clung to the hulls of the vessels as they attempted to pass; they were brought to a complete halt by Confederate soldiers who felled trees in the intended path. Unable to dislodge the enemy, Porter ordered a retreat, but then found that a party of Rebels had circled behind him and were cutting him off. Porter sent an immediate appeal for help to Grant, and then had his subordinates prepare to destroy their vessels rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The appeal was passed on to Major General William T. Sherman, commanding the Fifteenth Army Corps and already in the vicinity. He ordered two of his regiments <b>forward</b> <b>immediately,</b> and they met up with Porter's flotilla on the afternoon of 21 March. Sherman himself accompanied a larger body of troops that arrived in the enemy's rear the next day. The surprised Confederate soldiers immediately fled. Although the expedition was no longer opposed by the Rebels, Porter and Sherman concluded that nothing would be gained by resuming the advance. Accordingly, the retreat continued, and the flotilla was back on the Mississippi on 27 March.|$|E
500|$|When the Swedish king {{arrived to}} find half {{the city in}} flames and the Danes {{willing to put up}} a fight he had a {{difficult}} decision to make; whether to press <b>forward</b> <b>immediately</b> or to lay siege on the city and try to starve it out. His advisers were divided on the issue, and the king ultimately decided on the latter route. The wisdom of this decision has been questioned, since the Danish defenses were in poor shape initially. However, the population of Copenhagen rallied behind Frederick III, and the walls, moats and other defensive structures of the city were quickly improved. A large number of cannons were brought into the city from ships anchored in the harbor and placed along likely attack routes. The city also had plenty of defensive materiel: [...] of lead, 4,000 muskets, and a staggering [...] of slow match.|$|E
500|$|Gellibrand then {{ordered the}} 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to {{immediately}} take up {{positions on the}} forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was {{in full view of}} the approaching Germans. The 47th moved <b>forward</b> <b>immediately,</b> came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some [...] short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have [...] "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, [...] "ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as [...] "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only the latest in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.|$|E

5000|$|Even though Autotote {{officials}} {{characterized the}} scheme as {{the actions of}} a [...] "rogue software engineer,", the National Thoroughbred Racing Association took swift action {{in the face of a}} growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to allow bets to be <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately</b> after it closed. It also pressured its member tracks into not doing business with parlors that didn't have the ability to record wagers taken over the phone.|$|R
2500|$|The RCN ordered 70 {{original}} and 34 modified Flower-class vessels from Canadian shipbuilders. The Canadian shipbuilders also built seven original Flowers {{ordered by the}} USN; however, these vessels were transferred to the RN under the Lend-Lease Programme upon completion as wartime shipbuilding production in the United States had reached the level where the USN could dispense with vessels it had ordered in Canada. The RCN vessels had several design variations from their RN counterparts: the [...] "bandstand," [...] where the aft pom-pom gun was mounted, {{was moved to the}} rear of the superstructure; the galley was also moved <b>forward,</b> <b>immediately</b> abaft the engine room.|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, 2015, Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt {{announced}} that Canada {{has agreed to}} pay the entire cost to build a $250 million U.S. Customs plaza adjacent to the planned new Detroitâ€“Windsor bridge, now the Gordie Howe International Bridge. [...] Canada had already planned to pay for 95% of the bridge, which will cost $2.1 billion, {{and is expected to}} open in 2020. [...] "This allows Canada and Michigan to move the project <b>forward</b> <b>immediately</b> to its next steps which include further design work and property acquisition on the U.S. side of the border," [...] Raitt said in a statement issued after she spoke in the House of Commons.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton also {{admitted}} {{he had very}} little memory of the night after getting drunk, {{and did not know}} about the contents of the photos. Hamilton did not see the photos after their release, but listened on the phone as his wife described them to him. After the press conference Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said [...] "My first reaction in January was one of concern. Since then I've {{talked to a lot of}} people and they say it was significant that he came <b>forward</b> <b>immediately</b> and was honest about it." [...] Major League Baseball tested Hamilton for illegal drugs two days after the incident and he passed that test.|$|E

A D.O.R. with a rating of one (1) for two (2) consecutive training days will be <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately</b> to the FTO Commander.The program described above is a base program modeled after the San Jose FTEP. It {{is important to note}} that many departments have longer and very restrictive FTE programs. The San Jose is only a base model and many departments develop similar programs with the differences ranging from minimal to the very extensive.|$|R
5000|$|American {{sources said}} that no inquiry about ships in the area was made until after the Liberty attack ended. In a message sent from U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk to U.S. Ambassador Walworth Barbour, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Rusk asked for [...] "urgent confirmation" [...] of Israel's statement. Barbour responded: [...] "No request for info on U.S. ships {{operating}} off Sinai was made until after Liberty incident." [...] Further, Barbour stated: [...] "Had Israelis made such an inquiry {{it would have been}} <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately</b> to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept of State." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had written}} the letter rapidly, and then, as if afraid of again {{changing}} her mind about it, thrust it unread into the envelope, and directed it to her brother's London agent, to be <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately.</b> Then {{she went to the}} window and raised the sash to look out and listen. There was no sound at that hour except the occasional faintly-heard distant rattling of a cab. Only half-past two! What should she do to pass the time before three o'clock? Smiling to herself {{she went back to the}} table, and still pausing at intervals to listen, wrote a note to Fan.|$|R
2500|$|The need on the Gallipoli {{peninsula}} for {{means to}} carry {{water to the}} troops was considered so urgent that in mid-April, a request was forwarded to Egypt for the Zion Mule Corps to be sent immediately, regardless of its lack of equipment. Its commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, DSO, an Irish Protestant, and Captain Trumpeldor was Second-in-command. The Zion Mule Corps landed at Cape Helles from [...] four weeks after being raised, having been stranded at Mudros when its ship ran aground. The corps was embarked in the same ship as the Indian 9th Mule Corps bound for Gaba Tepe and so a detour to Helles was ordered. The Zion Mule Corps was disembarked under artillery fire from the Asiatic shore, with help of volunteers from the 9th Mule Corps and began carrying supplies <b>forward</b> <b>immediately.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rosecrans faced {{significant}} logistical challenges if {{he chose}} to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans {{would be forced to}} fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move <b>forward</b> <b>immediately</b> and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of [...] "recklessness, conceit and malice" [...] of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until at least August 17.|$|E
2500|$|DieudonnÃ©, the {{designer}} of the NiD 37, paid {{particular attention to the}} pilot's field of view, and the open cockpit, with screen and faired headrest, was placed well <b>forward,</b> <b>immediately</b> behind the engine. To improve the his view downward, the leading edges of the main wing, which outboard were straight and unswept, were curved sharply in towards the root, meeting the fuselage just behind the pilot's head. [...] He could thus look vertically down between this edge and the trailing edge of the foreplane, aligned with {{the leading edge of the}} outer sections of the mainplane and mounted well below on the undercarriage struts. Apart from long, curved tips, this foreplane had straight edges and constant chord; it had a span of about 40% that of the mainplane and less than 20% of its area. [...] Its function was largely to bring the centre of pressure forward. [...] The main wing was slightly tapered away from its roots and with square tips. [...] It was built around four spars and covered in stressed 3-ply, with long-span ailerons but no flaps. [...] On each side a V-form pair of tubular struts within aerofoil fairings braced the lower fuselage to the wing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{security}} of Autotote {{software for the}} racing industry garnered media attention in 2002 when one of their software developers attempted to steal $3 million {{through a hole in}} their software and processes described as [...] "... an example of a very simple exploitation of a rather stupid design flaw." [...] The role of Autotote's software in the 2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal caused the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to take swift action {{in the face of a}} growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to allow bets to be <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately</b> after a race closed. The Autotote racing division was sold to Sportech PLC in 2010.|$|R

Supposing you might not be returned from Scotland, I have deferred offering my thanks for this mark of your attention: and about the time when I should otherwise probably have written, I was seized with an inflammation in my eyes, from the effects of which I am not yet so far recovered as to make it prudent for me to use them in writing or reading.[143] ...|$|R
30|$|A Fast data {{collection}} for the node Faraway sink and Slow {{data collection}} for the node Close to sink (FFSC) approach is proposed to meet energy efficient, and the end-to-end delay can be minimized in Ref. [4]. In FFSC approach, {{for the region}} which is {{far away from the}} sink, nodes adopt a routing strategy of <b>forwarding</b> <b>immediately</b> if there is a forwarding node available. Thus, the remaining energy of the node in this region can be fully utilized. For nodes closer to the sink, the optimized relay nodes need to be selected before forwarding so as to save energy and maintain high network lifetime. Therefore, as a whole, the energy efficient utilization of FFSC approach is improved, and the network delay is reduced [4].|$|R
2500|$|Just before [...] German barrages {{began on}} the 99th Brigade front, between two battalions {{on the lower east}} slope of the Talus des Zouaves, on the Talus and on the {{communication}} trenches. The jumping-off trenches were destroyed, the 1st Battalion, royal Berkshire Regiment lost 100 men and after a platoon advanced and lost half its men, the attack was cancelled on local initiative. Communication with the rear was cut but a wireless stayed operational for long enough to inform the 99th Brigade and a liaison officer was sent to the 22nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers on left flank and runners went <b>forward</b> <b>immediately.</b> B Company and its section of the 226th Field Company did not receive a message and attacked at [...] reaching the German front line, despite German machine-gun fire sweeping across no man's land. Officers went forward to lead the company back but found only dead and wounded. The attack by the battalions on the flanks of the 99th Brigade went ahead and the 3rd Battalion Worcestershire Regiment of the 7th Brigade captured the objective. On the left flank, the 1/24th London and 1/21st London bombed their way into the old support line and front line, were driven out, recaptured them and were pushed back a second time.|$|E

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the Hungarian monarchy at the Battle of MohÃ¡cs (1526) first opened up a wider avenue for Laski's adventurous activity. Contrary to the wishes of his own sovereign, Sigismund I, whose pro-Austrian policy he detested, Laski entered the service of Janos ZÃ¡polya, the Magyar competitor for the Hungarian throne, thereby seriously compromising Poland both with the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and with the Pope. ZÃ¡polya despatched him on an embassy to Paris, Copenhagen and Munich for help. France granted ZÃ¡polya 20,000 in gold, five thousand of {{which was to be}} <b>forwarded</b> <b>immediately,</b> but on Laski's return, he found his patron a refugee in Transylvania, whither he had retired after his defeat by Ferdinand I in the Battle of Tarcal in 1527.|$|R

On arriving before Galway, he permitted that town and garrison to surrender on {{the terms of a}} pardon for all, security of property and estate, freedom of religious worship, and permission for the garrison to march away to Limerick, with drums beating and colours flying, the British furnishing horses for the transport of their cannon and baggage.|$|E

He selected the ablest and most active, both of foot soldiers and horsemen, ordered them to take two days' provisions, and then set forth with them that very evening. The party pressed on all that night, and the next day till noon. They halted till evening, and then set forth again. Very early the next morning they arrived at the encampment which the Persian nobleman had described. They found the remains of the camp-fires, and all the marks usually left upon a spot which has been used as the bivouac of an army. The army itself, however, was gone.|$|E

She knew the Major {{did not like to}} be seen at a surprise, and required a little preparation before he cared to be visible. Pen, when a boy, had incurred sad disgrace by carrying off from the Major's dressing-table a little morocco box, which it must be confessed contained the Major's back teeth, which he naturally would leave out of his jaws in a jolting mail-coach, and without which he would not choose to appear. Morgan, his man, made a mystery of mystery of his wigs: curling them in private places: introducing them mysteriously to his master's room;--nor without his head of hair would the Major care to show himself to any member of his family, or any acquaintance. He went to his apartment then and supplied these deficiencies; he groaned, and moaned, and wheezed, and cursed Morgan through his toilet, as an old buck will, who has been up all night with a rheumatism, and has a long duty to perform. And finally being belted, curled, and set straight, he descended upon the drawing-room, with a grave majestic air, such as befitted one who was at once a man of business and a man of fashion.|$|E
