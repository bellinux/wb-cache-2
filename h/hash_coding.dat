40|$|Similarity search {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many applications involving high-dimensional data. Due to the known dimensionality curse, the performance of most existing indexing structures degrades quickly as the feature dimensionality increases. Hashing methods, such as locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variants, have been widely used to achieve fast approximate similarity search by trading search quality for efficiency. However, most existing hashing methods make use of randomized algorithms to generate <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> without considering the specific structural information in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing method, namely, robust hashing with local models (RHLM), which learns a set of robust hash functions to map the high-dimensional data points into binary <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> by effectively utilizing local structural information. In RHLM, for each individual data point in the training dataset, a local hashing model is learned and used to predict the <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> of its neighboring data points. The local models from all the data points are globally aligned so that an optimal <b>hash</b> <b>code</b> can be assigned to each data point. After obtaining the <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> of all the training data points, we design a robust method by employing l(2),(1) -norm minimization on the loss function to learn effective hash functions, which are then used to map each database point into its <b>hash</b> <b>code.</b> Given a query data point, the search process first maps it into the query <b>hash</b> <b>code</b> by the <b>hash</b> functions and then explores the buckets, which have similar <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> to the query <b>hash</b> <b>code.</b> Extensive experimental results conducted on real-life datasets show that the proposed RHLM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of search quality and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|For {{efficiently}} retrieving nearest neighbours from large-scale multi-view data, recently hashing {{methods are}} widely investigated, which can substantially improve query speeds. In this paper, we propose an effective probability-based Semantics-Preserving Hashing method {{to tackle the}} problem of cross-view retrieval, termed SePH. Considering the semantic consistency between views, SePH generates one unified <b>hash</b> <b>code</b> for all observed views of any instance. For training, SePH firstly transforms the given semantic affinities of training data into a probability distribution, and aims to approximate it with another one in Hamming space, via minimizing their Kullback-Leibler divergence. Specifically, the latter probability distribution is derived from all pair-wise Hamming distances between to be-learnt <b>hash</b> <b>codes</b> of the training data. Then with learnt <b>hash</b> <b>codes,</b> any kind of predictive models like linear ridge regression, logistic regression or kernel logistic regression, can be learnt as hash functions in each view for projecting the corresponding view-specific features into <b>hash</b> <b>codes.</b> As for out of-sample extension, given any unseen instance, the learnt hash functions in its observed views can predict view-specific <b>hash</b> <b>codes.</b> Then by deriving or estimating the corresponding output probabilities w. r. t the predicted view-specific <b>hash</b> <b>codes,</b> a novel probabilistic approach is further proposed to utilize them for determining a unified <b>hash</b> <b>code.</b> To evaluate the proposed SePH, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets,and the experimental results demonstrate that SePH is reasonable and effective...|$|R

40|$|Hashing {{is widely}} applied to {{approximate}} nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimodal retrieval with storage and computation efficiency. Cross-modal hashing improves {{the quality of}} <b>hash</b> <b>coding</b> by exploiting semantic correlations across different modalities. Existing cross-modal hashing methods first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors, and then generate binary codes by another separate quantization step. However, suboptimal hash codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes. This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal hashing, which jointly learns good data representation tailored to <b>hash</b> <b>coding</b> and formally controls the quantization error. The proposed CHN is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good image representations, a multilayer perception for learning good text representations, two hashing layers for generating compact binary codes, and a structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical study shows that CHN yields {{state of the art}} cross-modal retrieval performance on standard benchmarks. Comment: 7 page...|$|E

40|$|As {{the rapid}} growth of {{multi-modal}} data, hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval have received considerable attention. Deep-networks-based cross-modal hashing methods are appealing as they can integrate feature learning and <b>hash</b> <b>coding</b> into end-to-end trainable frameworks. However, it is still challenging to find content similarities between different modalities of data due to the heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem, we propose an adversarial hashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi-modal data. The proposed new adversarial network, HashGAN, consists of three building blocks: 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations, 2) the generative attention module to generate an attention mask, which is used to obtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature representations, 3) the discriminative <b>hash</b> <b>coding</b> module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework, the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in an adversarial way: the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w. r. t. the background feature representations, while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w. r. t. both the foreground and the background feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.

The paradigm problem considered {{is that of}} testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hashcoding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are {{the size of the}} hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended {{to reduce the amount of}} space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch " the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.
