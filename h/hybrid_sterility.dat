2500|$|Theodosius Dobzhansky, an {{emigrant}} {{from the}} Soviet Union to the United States, {{who had been}} a postdoctoral worker in Morgan's fruit fly lab, {{was one of the first}} to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with Drosophila pseudoobscura. He says pointedly: [...] "Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority." [...] Not surprisingly, there were other Russian geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the West. His 1937 work Genetics and the Origin of Species was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others. Further, Dobzhansky asserted that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the chromosomes, and linked more or less strongly to each other according to their physical distances from each other on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky's [...] "evolutionary genetics" [...] was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro- and macroevolution. His work emphasized that real world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models, and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of Sergei Chetverikov, who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population before his work was shut down by the rise of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union. By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue [...] that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies.

My dissertation addresses a variety of evolutionary genetic questions using this system. Rigorous studies {{of the relationships between}} host races of D. mojavensis and the relationships among the members of the species group (D. mojavensis, D. arizona, and D. navojoa) are lacking. I used mitochondrial CO 1 sequence data to address the phylogenetics and population genetics of this species group (Appendix A). In this study I have found that the sister species D. mojavensis and D. arizonae share no mitochondrial haplotypes and thus show no evidence for recent introgression. I estimate the divergence time between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae to be between 0. 66 and 0. 99 million years ago. I performed additional population genetic analyses of these species to provide a basis for future hypothesis testing. In Appendix B, I report the first example of substantial intraspecific polymorphism for genetic factors contributing to <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility.</b> I show that the occurrence of <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> in crosses between Drosophila mojavensis and its sister species, D. arizonae is controlled by factors present at different frequencies in different populations of D. mojavensis.

40|$|Recent genetic {{analyses}} of {{closely related species}} of Drosophila have indicated that <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> is the consequence of highly complex synergistic effects among multiple genes, both conspecific and heterospecific. On the contrary, much evidence suggests the presence of major genes causing <b>hybrid</b> female <b>sterility</b> and inviability in the less-related species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Does this contrast reflect the genetic distance between species? Or, generally, is the genetic basis of <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> more complex than that of <b>hybrid</b> female <b>sterility</b> and inviability? To clarify this point, the D. simulans introgression of the cytological region 34 D- 36 A to the D. melanogaster genome, which causes recessive male sterility, was dissected by recombination, deficiency, and complementation mapping. The 450 -kb region between two genes, Suppressor of Hairless and snail, exhibited a strong effect on the sterility. Males are (semi-) sterile if this region of the introgression is made homozygous or hemizygous. But no genes in the region singly cause the sterility; this region has at least two genes, which in combination result in male sterility. Further, the males are less fertile when heterozygous with a larger introgression, which suggests that dominant modifiers enhance the effects of recessive genes of male sterility.

40|$|Crosses between {{closely related}} animal species often result in male hybrids that are sterile, and the {{molecular}} and functional basis of genetic factors for <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> {{is of great}} interest. Here, we report a molecular and functional analysis of HMS 1, a region of 9. 2 kb in chromosome 3 of Drosophila mauritiana, which results in virtually complete <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> when homozygous in the genetic background of sibling species Drosophila simulans. The HMS 1 region contains two strong candidate genes for the genetic incompatibility, agt and Taf 1. Both encode unrelated DNA-binding proteins, agt for an alkyl-cysteine-S-alkyltransferase and Taf 1 for a subunit of transcription factor TFIID {{that serves as a}} multifunctional transcriptional regulator. The contribution of each gene to <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> was assessed by means of germ-line transformation, with constructs containing complete agt and Taf 1 genomic sequences as well as various chimeric constructs. Both agt and Taf 1 contribute about equally to HMS 1 <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility.</b> Transgenes containing either locus rescue sterility in about one-half of the males, and among fertile males the number of offspring is in the normal range.

40|$|Postzygotic {{reproductive}} isolation {{is characterized by}} two striking empirical patterns. The first is Haldane’s rule—the preferential inviability or <b>sterility</b> of species <b>hybrids</b> of the heterogametic (XY) sex. The second is the so-called large X effect—substitution of one species’s X chromosome for another’s has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid fitness compared to similar substitution of an autosome. Although the first rule has been well-established, the second rule remains controversial. Here, we dissect the genetic causes of these two rules using a genome-wide introgression analysis of Drosophila mauritiana chromosome segments in an otherwise D. sechellia genetic background. We find that recessive hybrid incompatibilities outnumber dominant ones and that hybrid male steriles outnumber all other types of incompatibility, consistent with the dominance and faster-male theories of Haldane’s rule, respectively. We also find that, although X-linked and autosomal introgressions are of similar size, most X-linked introgressions cause <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> (60 %) whereas few autosomal introgressions do (18 %). Our results thus confirm the large X effect and identify its proximate cause: incompatibilities causing <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> have a higher density on the X chromosome than on the autosomes.

Their experiments consisted of cross-breeding Drosophila mutants and documenting offspring. Another highly regarded figure in Drosophila research was Theodosius Dobzhansky, who invented the use of genetic markers and used them to study <b>hybrid</b> <b>sterility</b> between Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis (Futuyma 1997).

50|$|In all {{parthenogenetic}} reptile species {{studied to}} date, chromosomal evidence supports {{the theory that}} parthenogenesis arose through a hybridization event, although members of the genus Lepidophyma may be exceptions to this rule. The original hybridization event is believed to occur between two related species and is often followed by backcrossing to either parent species to create triploid parthenogenetic offspring. As no crosses of two sexual species in captivity have ever produced parthenogenetic offspring, {{it is unclear how}} a hybridization event would actually lead to asexual reproduction. It is possible that parthenogenesis evolved as a way of overcoming sterility due to improper chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis in hybrids, and that rare hybrid individuals that could premeiotically duplicate their chromosomes could escape <b>hybrid</b> <b>sterility</b> by reproducing through parthenogenesis. The ability to premeiotically duplicate chromosomes would be selected for in this scenario as it would be the only option for successful reproduction.|$|E

We used a series of reciprocal crosses between wild-derived strains of Mus musculus and M. domesticus to examine F 1 <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility,</b> one of the primary phenotypes thought to isolate these species. We report four main results. First, we found significantly smaller testes and fewer sperm in hybrid male progeny of most crosses. Second, in some crosses <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> was asymmetric and depended on the species origin of the X chromosome. These observations confirm and extend previ-ous findings, underscoring the central role that the M. musculus X chromosome plays in reproductive isolation. Third, comparisons among reciprocal crosses revealed polymorphism at one or more hybrid incompatibilities within M. musculus. Fourth, the sper-matogenic phenotype of this polymorphic interaction appears distinct from previously described hybrid incompatibilities between these species.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of microorganisms in the cytoplasm of certain species. The presence of these organisms in a species and their absence in another causes the non-viability of the corresponding hybrid. For example, in the semi-species of the group D. paulistorum the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, {{this is due to}} the presence of a Wolbachia in the cytoplasm which alters spermatogenesis leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of D. simulans have been studied that show <b>hybrid</b> <b>sterility</b> according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism Wolbachia and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific antibiotic to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this symbiont. It has been suggested that, in some cases, the speciation process has taken place because of the incompatibility caused by this bacteria. Two wasp species Nasonia giraulti and N. longicornis carry two different strains of Wolbachia. Crosses between an infected population and one free from infection produces a nearly total reproductive isolation between the semi-species. However, if both species are free from the bacteria or both are treated with antibiotics there is no reproductive barrier. Wolbachia also induces incompatibility due to the weakness of the hybrids in populations of spider mites (Tetranychus urticae), between Drosophila recens and D. subquinaria [...] and between species of Diabrotica (beetle) and Gryllus (cricket).|$|E

Traditionally, research strategies have been based on contrasting introgressions of chromosome segments that produce male sterility with those that allow fertility. Few studies have investigated the phenotypes associated with the boundary between fertility and sterility. In this study, we cointrogressed three different X chromosome segments from Drosophila mauritiana into D. simulans. Hybrid males with these three segments are usually fertile, by conventional fertility assays. However, their spermatogenesis shows a significant slowdown, most manifest at lower temperatures. Each of the three introgressed segments retards the arrival of sperm to the seminal vesicles. Other small disturbances in spermatogenesis are evident, which altogether lead to an overall reduction in the amount of motile sperm in their seminal vesicles. These results suggest that a delay in the timing of spermatogenesis, which might be brought about by the cumulative action of many different factors of minor segment, may be the primary cause of <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility...</b>|$|R
40|$|The X {{chromosome}} often plays {{a central}} role in <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> between species, but it is unclear if this reflects underlying regulatory incompatibilities. Here we combine phenotypic data with genome-wide expression data to directly associate aberrant expression patterns with <b>hybrid</b> male <b>sterility</b> between two species of mice. We used a reciprocal cross in which F 1 males are sterile in one direction and fertile in the other direction, allowing us to associate expression differences with sterility rather than with other hybrid phenotypes. We found evidence of extensive over-expression of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis in sterile but not in fertile F 1 hybrid males. Over-expression was most pronounced in genes that are normally expressed after meiosis, consistent with an X chromosome-wide disruption of expression during the later stages of spermatogenesis. This pattern was not a simple consequence of faster evolutionary divergence on the X chromosome, because X-linked expression was highly conserved between the two species. Thus, transcriptional regulation of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis appears particularly sensitive to evolutionary divergence between species.

We report the results of a large experiment focused on the reciprocal introgression of the X chromosome between two species of house mice, Mus musculus and M. domesticus. Introgression of the M. musculus X chromosome into a wild-derived M. domesticus genetic background produced male-limited sterility, qualitatively consistent with previous experiments using classic inbred strains to represent M. domesticus. The genetic basis of sterility involved a minimum of four X-linked factors. The phenotypic effects of major sterility QTL were largely additive and resulted in complete sterility when combined. No sterility factors were uncovered on the M. domesticus X chromosome.
