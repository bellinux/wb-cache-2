5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who grabbed land from the aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided them up and <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> over – allegedly without making a penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E
5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} banners {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them and <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> to the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers.|$|E

5|$|The report {{compiled}} by Halbish and Crompton was privately forwarded to the ACB's remaining directors and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC was not informed directly; the ACB delivered {{the news to}} their chairman Clyde Walcott and chief executive David Richards.

5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August 1972, Amin {{issued a}} decree {{ordering}} {{the expulsion of}} the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> over to his supporters. The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> over to the French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed {{to make contact with}} a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a janitor}} of Sony/ATV Music Publishing {{found in a}} {{dumpster}} the unfinished lyrics written by Williams that {{had been found in}} his car the night he died. The worker claimed that she sold Williams' notes to a representative of the Honky-Tonk Hall of Fame and the Rock-N-Roll Roadshow. The janitor was accused of theft, but the charges were later dropped when a judge determined that her version of events was true. The unfinished lyrics were later returned to Sony/ATV, which <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> to Bob Dylan in 2008 to complete the songs for a new album. Ultimately, the completion of the album included recordings by Alan Jackson, Norah Jones, Jack White, Lucinda Williams, Vince Gill, Rodney Crowell, Patty Loveless, Levon Helm, Jakob Dylan, Sheryl Crow and Merle Haggard. The album, named The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams was released on October 4, 2011.|$|E

In what turned out to be the highest scoring match involving Bengaluru FC, the home team won the game 5–3 in spite of missed chances and defensive blunders. Bengaluru FC registered their third consecutive win in the group stage with 2–1 home win against Lao Toyota. A goal each from Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Kim Song-Yong in each half took Bengaluru FC to a win and with the win the team also advanced to round of 16 for the second year in running.

5|$|Queen's Park {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the teamwork of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked it behind the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led to a shot from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2–1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had been expected to be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> over in the dressing rooms.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{never reached}} divisional strength, being {{at most a}} brigade-sized {{formation}} of between 6,000 and 6,500 troops. In May 1944, members of the division arrested 281 Jews in Pristina and <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> over to the Germans, who transported them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. The division itself was better known for this action and for murdering, raping, and looting in predominantly Serb areas than for participating in combat operations {{on behalf of the}} German war effort. Its only significant military actions took place during a German anti-Partisan offensive in the German occupied territory of Montenegro in June and July 1944. Following those operations, the unit was deployed as a guard force at the chromium mines in Kosovo, where it was quickly overrun by the Partisans, leading to widespread desertion. Reinforced by German Kriegsmarine personnel and with fewer than 500 Albanians remaining in its ranks, it was disbanded on 1 November 1944. The remaining members were incorporated into the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. After the war, divisional commander SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS August Schmidhuber was found guilty of war crimes by a court in Belgrade and executed in 1947.|$|E
