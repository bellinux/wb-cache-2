40|$|We analyse Czech {{intraday market}} for {{electricity}} {{and its impact}} on day- ahead prices. We inspect effect of fundamental drivers of price deviation between intraday and day-ahead market in form of positive and negative forecast errors and examine intraday price's role in explaining next trading period's <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price.</b> Our findings suggest photovoltaic and load fore- cast errors to be most statistically significant fundamental factors, together with autoregressive term and <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price,</b> determining intraday market price deviation from day-ahead. Variables' influences on intraday market are in accordance with hypothesised expectations, except for the effect of export and excessive import of electricity to and from German TSO, 50 Hertz, and extreme day-ahead prices. We confirmed symmetric effects of forecast errors on intraday price for all observed variables. In the second part, intraday prices are found to be statistically significant factor affecting next day's day-ahead market price. The results support the conclusion that Czech spot market for electricity possesses mean-reverting properties. Keywords electricity, intraday market for electricity, price modelin...|$|E
30|$|Reference [22] {{forecasts}} the mid-term UK baseload {{electricity prices}} by forecasting {{the prices of}} each day and averaging the forecasts afterwards. As is known, block transaction is adopted in the UK spot market. The UK baseload electricity price has a lower price fluctuation. Therefore, it is less sensitive to load variation and fuel price fluctuation. However, the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> in Electric reliability council of Texas (ERCOT) varies {{from time to time}} and day to day. It is highly sensitive to load variations and fuel price fluctuations. Month ahead daily load forecasting and daily fuel price forecasting is not accurate enough, which may result in low accuracy of hourly <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> forecasting if we forecast the daily electricity prices of ERCOT and average the forecasts afterward. The month ahead monthly load forecasting accuracy is approximately 98 %. The month ahead fuel price forecasting can learn from the future price, which usually has good results [23]. Hence, the advantage of forecasting the average daily electricity price profile directly instead of forecasting the hourly electricity prices and average the forecasts afterwards is clear due to the higher accuracy of monthly load forecasting and average fuel price forecasting.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the importance of a set of explanatory (input) variables for the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> forecast in the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The available input variables include extensive hourly time series records of weather forecasts, previous prices, and regional aggregation of power generations and power demands. The paper {{presents the}} comparisons of the forecasting results achieved with a model which includes all these available input variables (EMPF model) with respect to those obtained by other forecasting models containing a reduced set of input variables. These comparisons identify the most important variables for forecasting purposes. In addition, a novel Reference Explanatory Model for Price Estimations (REMPE) that achieves hourly price estimations by using actual power generations and power demands of such day is described in the paper, which offers the lowest limit for the forecasting error of the EMPF model. All the models have been implemented using the same technique (artificial neural networks) and have been satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The relative importance of each explanatory variable is identified for the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> forecasts in the MIBEL.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new modelling framework for <b>day-ahead</b> electricity <b>prices</b> based on multivariate Levy semistationary (MLSS) processes. <b>Day-ahead</b> <b>prices</b> specify the prices for electricity delivered over certain time {{windows on the}} next day and are determined in a daily auction.

We extend the work by Barndorff-Nielsen et al.

Furthermore, we provide a detailed empirical study using data from the European Energy Exchange (EEX) and give new insights into the intra-daily correlation structure of electricity <b>day-ahead</b> <b>prices</b> in the EEX market. The flexible structure of MLSS processes is able to reproduce the stylized facts of such data rather well. Furthermore, these processes can be used to model negative prices in electricity markets which started to occur recently and cannot be described by many classical models...|$|R

Abstract: This chapter presents some {{results of an}} econometric analysis (developed in Patrick and Wolak 2001 b) of customer-level demands for electricity of large and medium-sized industrial and commercial customers purchasing electricity under half-hourly spot prices and demand charges coincident with system peaks in the England and Wales (E&W) electricity market. These estimates {{can be used to}} forecast customer-level price responsiveness, design alternative time-of-use and fixed retail pricing options, and develop demand side bids. Here, we focus on how customers respond to real-time prices and how this response can be used in designing demand side bids. A significant price response in the market price determination process will reduce the magnitude and volatility of spot prices in restructured electricity markets. <b>Day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> elasticity estimates vary substantially by time-of-day, industry, and firms within industries; with sample mean averages ranging from essentially zero to 0. 86 in absolute value.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{suggests}} a decentralized optimization of residential demand {{to minimize the}} cost to the utility company and customers while maintaining customer satisfaction. As an impor-tant feature, distribution system constraints such as equipment ca-pacity, line flow limits, and phase balance constraints are taken into account. Due to the large amount of uncertainty in the residen-tial demand, a two-stage pricing is considered. In the first stage, <b>day-ahead</b> <b>prices</b> as well as residential appliance scheduling are determined through interaction of the utility company and res-idential customers. Uncertainty of the customer demand is also considered in the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>pricing.</b> In the second stage, on the other hand, prices will be updated based on the actual residential loads. Similar to locational marginal price (LMP) in transmission system, customers on different nodes are charged with different prices.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new scheme for autonomous electricity cooperatives, called predictive cooperative (PCP), which aggregates {{commercial and residential}} electricity consumers and participates in the electricity market on behalf of its members. An axiomatic approach is proposed to calculate the day-ahead bid and to disaggregate the collective cost among participating consumers. The resulting formulation is shown to keep the members incentivized to both participate in the cooperative and remain truthful in reporting their expected loads. The scheme is implemented using PJM (world's largest wholesale electricity market) real-time and <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> data for 2015 {{and a collection of}} residential and commercial load profiles.

40|$|We study price {{convergence}} {{between the}} two major markets for wholesale electricity in California from their deregulation in April 1998 through November 2000, nearly the end of trading in one market.

Instead of using price se-ries, one-period continuously compounded return series is used to achieve more attractive statistical properties. The autoregres-sive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX) model is used to catch the linear relationship between price return se-ries and explanatory variable load series, the generalized autore-gressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model is used to un-veil the heteroscedastic character of residuals, and AWNN is used to present the nonlinear, nonstationary impact of load series on electricity prices. The Monte Carlo method is adopted to generate more evenly distributed random numbers used for time series and AWNN models to accelerate the convergence.

We estimate {{the impact of the}} German supply of wind and solar electricity on the Dutch <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> of electricity and the utilisation of the conventional power plants. We take cross-border capacity constraints into account and use hourly plant-level data over 2006 – 2014. We find that the price elasticity of German wind on Dutch day-ahead prices is − 0. 03. However, this effect vanishes when the cross-border capacity is fully utilised. We find a modest negative impact on the utilisation of the Dutch power plants. As such, we conclude that the German Energiewende has had modest spill-over effects to the Dutch market. The recent dramatic performance of the Dutch gas-fired plants {{can be attributed to the}} changes in the relative prices of coal versus natural gas.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} model of a {{purchaser}} of electricity in Norway, bidding into a wholesale electricity pool market that operates a day ahead of dispatch. The purchaser must arrange purchase for an uncertain demand that occurs the following day. Deviations from the day-ahead purchase are bought in a secondary market at a price that differs from the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> by virtue of regulating offers submitted by generators. Under an assumption that arbitrageurs are absent in these markets, we study conditions under which the purchaser should bid their expected demand and examine the two-period game played between a single generator and purchaser {{in the presence of a}} competitive fringe. In all our models, it is found that purchasers have an incentive to underbid their expected demand, and so the day-ahead prices will be below expected real-time prices. We also derive conditions on the optimal demand curve that purchasers should bid if the behavior of the other participants is unknown but can be modeled by a market distribution function.

40|$|Electricity markets {{may become}} more {{sensitive}} to weather conditions because of a higher penetration of renewable energy sources and climatic changes. We investigate whether weather conditions had a growing influence on the average daily <b>day-ahead</b> <b>price</b> in the Dutch electricity market in the period 2006 - 2011, a period when renewable energy production increased. We account for weather conditions in both the Netherlands and Germany, as these two markets are closely connected. We find that the average wind speed in Germany negatively affects Dutch electricity prices. This effect is fairly constant despite the significant increase in German wind energy capacity. The impact of wind speed in the Netherlands on Dutch electricity prices slightly increased. We do not find a robust effect of the intensity of sunshine on electricity prices. The Dutch electricity price remains {{to a large extent}} related to the marginal costs of conventional gas-fired power plants. Although renewable energy sources have an increasing share in the generation portfolio, their impact on the electricity price in the Dutch electricity market is modest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of optimal dynamic pricing for retail {{electricity}} with an unknown demand model is considered. Under the <b>day-ahead</b> dynamic <b>pricing</b> (a. k. a. real time pricing) mechanism, a retailer obtains electricity in a twosettlement wholesale market and serves its customers in real time. Without knowledge on the aggregated demand function of its customers, the retailer aims to maximize its retail surplus by sequentially adjusting its price based {{on the behavior of}} its customers in the past. An online learning algorithm, referred to as piecewise linear stochastic approximation (PWLSA), is proposed. It is shown that PWLSA achieves the optimal rate of learning defined by the growth rate of cumulative regret. In particular, the regret of PWLSA is shown to grow logarithmically with respect to the learning horizon, and no other on-line learning algorithm can have the growth rate slower than that of PWLSA.

A Stackelberg game {{is used to}} model interactions between a retailer and its customers; the retailer sets the <b>day-ahead</b> hourly <b>price</b> of electricity and consumers adjust real-time consumptions to maximize individual consumer surplus. For thermostatic demands, the optimal aggregated demand is shown to be an affine function of the <b>day-ahead</b> hourly <b>price.</b> A complete characterization of the trade-offs between consumer surplus and retail profit is obtained. The Pareto front of achievable trade-offs is shown to be concave, and each point on the Pareto front is achieved by an optimal <b>day-ahead</b> hourly <b>price.</b> Effects of integrating renewables and local storage are analyzed. It is shown that benefits of renewable integration all go to the retailer when the capacity of renewable is relatively small.
