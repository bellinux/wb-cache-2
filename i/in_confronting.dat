5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> the khagan, and {{the wise}} strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|PedroII {{was faced}} by three crises between 1848 and 1852. The first test came <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> {{the trade in}} {{illegally}} imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 {{as part of a}} treaty with Great Britain. Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade. While Brazil grappled with this problem, the Praieira revolt erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The Eusébio de Queirós Law was promulgated on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.|$|E
5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate the importation of slaves and Britain recognized that the trade had been at last suppressed.|$|E

These men were not trying to enter into an armed conflict on the French-Spanish border and were not interested <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> Franco, but the French feared they might and so held these Spaniards in Gurs for a short time. The camp also briefly housed German prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some kind}} of reform was {{obviously}} needed to contrast the criminal problems of the streets, nowadays critics believe that watchmen were actually vigorously engaged in catching offenders, and that their work might be concealed in the records because the official arrest would be recorded by the constable {{in charge of the}} watch. The Old Bailey Session Papers report many examples of watchmen being very capable and brave <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> and arresting offenders. Probably the statutory reward to be earned from the arrest of a street robber or a burglar was quite a good incentive, not to mention possible private gratuities and local rewards.|$|E
25|$|A {{more direct}} {{manifestation of the}} growing {{reaction}} against secularism was {{the revival of the}} Sufi brotherhoods. Not only did suppressed Sufi orders such as the Kadiri, Mevlevi, Nakşibendi, Khālidiyyā and Al-Ṭarīqah al-Tijāniyyah reemerge, but new movements were formed, including the Nur Cemaati, Gülen movement, Sülaymānīyyā, Community of İskenderpaşa and İsmailağa. The Tijāni became especially militant <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> the state. For example, Tijāni damaged monuments to Atatürk to symbolize their opposition to his policy of secularization. This was however a very isolated incident and only involved one particular Sheikh of the order. Throughout the 1950s, there were numerous trials of Ticani and other Sufi leaders for antistate activities. Simultaneously, however, some movements, notably the Süleymancı and Nurcular, cooperated with those politicians perceived as supportive of pro-Islamic policies. The Nurcular eventually advocated support for Turkey's multiparty political system, and one of its offshoots, the Gülen movement, had supported the True Path Party while the Işıkçılar and Enver Ören had openly supported the Motherland Party since the mid-1980s.|$|E

Gandhi reiterated his stance that [...] "the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart", and use [...] "satyagraha <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> the Arabs" [...] in 1947. According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.|$|E

During {{the early months of}} 1122, the Song empire mobilized its armed forces to assist the Jurchen <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> their common enemy, the Liao Dynasty. Therefore, it appears that Zhou died in late 1121, before the call to arms was issued.|$|E

500|$|Arshagouni, on {{the other}} hand, {{describes}} the Devotions as Donne's most mature, perhaps most complex work: a remarkable, sustained prose-poem that not only expresses conflicting and powerful internal emotions but also consciously provides its readers with a touching model of the experiences of God's elect <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> the inexorable course of human sinfulness that characterizes life on earth. Helen Wilcox writes that [...] "the mixture of elaborate rhetoric, painstaking argument, and the frank details of his melancholic 'ridling distemper' creates a particularly powerful impact" [...] and draws particular attention to Meditation XVII, noting that despite the apparent self-interest of the Devotions, that piece highlights Donne's recognition of the ultimate interconnectedness of humanity. Meditation XVII was also the focus of Robert Jungman, who, writing in American Notes and Queries, noted it as the most forceful statement of Donne's theme in what was ultimately a [...] "powerful psychological analysis".|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage <b>in</b> <b>confronting</b> the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E
