50|$|Structure 5D-91, {{the central}} {{structure}}, is a twin facade structure facing both north and south. This building {{is the main}} section of the southern range and is the largest building in the whole Plaza of the Seven Temples. The structure consists of three parts, a stepped basal platform with five levels, the superstructure containing the building's rooms, and a roof comb. The structure was accessed via wide symmetrical stairways on both {{the northern and southern}} sides. It has been restored by archaeologists and possessed a long gallery that was later split into three rooms with the addition of 1 m thick dividing walls. This structure has small sculpted anthropomorphic masks on each of its corners and possibly two further masks in the centre of the north and south sides, although very little remains of these. It possesses a small roof comb that is decorated with a further ten masks. The masks are still partly visible and show feather decorations and, in some cases, necklaces. The masks have stylistic similarities with sculpted monuments at the city. The roof comb was built from five small vaulted sections, each with a mask on both its north and south face. Structure 5D-91 had 6 doors, with three on the north side and three on the south. The three rooms had small <b>doors</b> <b>linking</b> them; and each room had a lower ceiling at each end, with a higher section in the middle. Structure 5D-91 has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|R

The original host image {{can be obtained}} upon the extraction of the embedded information. Driving application of reversible date hiding is authentic {{and can be used}} in some special applications, such as law enforcement, banks, medical and military fields, where original cover media is required for legal reason. Embedding data into cover media while keeping the media reversible opens a new <b>door</b> for <b>linking</b> some data with original media. With this proposed method we ensure that the Host information improves the compression efficiency, and thus the lossless data embedding capability is achieved.

Most surveillance of internal doors is accomplished by direct listening while other methods may be used for external doors. Because of the multiple paths of sound through and around a door, vibration sound maskers are used on doors. The figure on the right shows one such installation.|$|R
40|$|Since Cajal 2 ̆ 7 s early drawings, the {{characterization}} of neuronal architecture has been paramount in understanding neuronal function. With the development of electrophysiological techniques that provide unprecedented access to the physiology of these cells, experimental questions of neuronal function have also become more tractable. Fluorescent tracers that can label the anatomy of individual or populations of neurons have opened the <b>door</b> to <b>linking</b> anatomy with physiology. Experimentally however, current techniques for bulk labeling of cells in vitro often affect neuronal function creating a barrier for exploring structure-function questions. Here we describe a new technique for highly localized electroporation within a cell or cell population that enables the introduction of membrane impermeable charged dyes including dextran-conjugated fluorophores, hydrazide tracers, and calcium indicator dyes in vitro. We demonstrate that this technique is highly versatile, allowing for labeling of large or small areas of tissue, allowing for the investigation of both cellular morphology and physiological activity in identified neuronal circuits in acute brain slices. Furthermore, this approach allows subsequent targeted whole-cell patch recording based on well-defined connectivity as well as assessment of physiological activity in targeted circuits on a fast time scale...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{back door}} has been {{proposed}} to be an exit pathway from the myosin active site for phosphate (Pi) generated by adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate hydrolysis. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of Pi with {{the back door and}} the plausibility of Pi release via this route. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the Dictyostelium motor domain with bound Mg·adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) and Pi, modeled upon the Mg·ADP·BeFx and Mg·ADP·Vi structures. Simulations revealed that the relaxation of ADP and free Pi from their initial positions reduced the diameter of the back door via motions of switch 1 and switch 2 located in the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains, respectively. In neither simulation could Pi freely diffuse out the back door. Water molecules, however, could flux through the back door in the Mg·ADP·BeFx-based simulation but not in the Mg·ADP·Vi-based simulation. In neither structure was water observed fluxing through the main (front door) entrance. These observations suggest that the ability of Pi to leave via the back <b>door</b> is <b>linked</b> tightly to conformational changes between the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains. The simulations offer structural explanations for 18 O-exchange with Pi at the active site, and Pi release being the rate-limiting step in the myosin adenosine 5 ′-triphosphatase...|$|R

A Geometric model was developed to understand the path traced by the <b>door</b> for various <b>link</b> angles and lengths. Solid modeling of the door was carried out using Solidworks R and simulation of the path of the door for various angles and lengths of the links of the 4 bar mechanism was also done.

40|$|The {{air pumping}} {{effect of a}} fire plume, {{proposed}} years ago, to give a higher air intake rate through vertical openings in a compartment fire is further investigated in this paper. Equations for the air intake rate through vertical openings {{found in the literature}} are reviewed. As most of the reported correlation expressions were derived empirically from experiments, results might be different if the fire geometry, fuel type and ambient conditions are different. Furthermore, most of the data on heat release rates in earlier experiments were measured from the mass loss rate of fuel, not by the oxygen consumption method. Values used therefore might deviate from the actual heat release rates. Aerodynamic flow through a doorway, induced by a compartment fire, is commonly simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Factors which are difficult to control in experiments but affecting the doorway airflow can be studied more easily with CFD. In the study presented in this paper a two-room structure with a fire room connected to an adjacent room through a door was selected. Different <b>door</b> widths <b>linking</b> the two rooms were set to give different ventilation factors. A total number of 16 simulations using the popular CFD software, Fire Dynamics Simulator, based on large eddy simulations, were carried out with different heat release rates of a fire in the fire room. Predicted horizontal velocity components were used to estimate the air intake rates through the door to justify the air pumping action. It appears that there is an air pumping effect of the fire plume for cases with lower ventilation factors, even for pre-flashover fires. Results further confirmed earlier experimental data on post-flashover fires. Therefore, further study on possible air pump effects in a room fire is strongly recommended.

50|$|In Pursuit of Beauty, a major {{exhibition}} of Aesthetic Movement decorative arts, was mounted at MMA in 1986. The cover of its catalogue was {{a photograph of}} the cabinet. Contributor Marilynn Johnson wrote:The most successful American interpretations of the Talbert style of Modern Gothic furniture were apparently the result of a collaboration between a highly skilled Philadelphia cabinetmaker and carver, DANIEL PABST, and FRANK FURNESS, a Philadelphia architect. Furniture believed to have been produced by Pabst and Furness includes a desk that was handed down in the Furness family, at least two suites of furniture owned by Theodore Roosevelt, and, most impressive of all, a cabinet that has only recently come to light. Its rooflike pediment, angular base, chamfered edges, truncated columns, elaborate strap hinges, and decorated <b>door</b> panels all <b>link</b> this cabinet to the Modern Gothic furniture of British architect-designers such as Burges. The scrolling, finely carved brackets, however, specifically suggest the form of Talbert's wall cupboard, and the cutaway pattern of stylized flowers on the upper doors is reminiscent of the decoration on a sideboard that relates closely to the Holland and Sons sideboard of 1867 and is illustrated as number 20 in Gothic Forms. Talbert's work may well have been the source for the design of the cabinet.|$|R

According to style, the {{selected}} woodcarving motifs, and the iconography of the Annunciation these doors belong to the group of Royal <b>Doors</b> that are <b>linked</b> to Ohrid and its existing artistic workshops from the mid 16 th century. Namely, the Royal Doors from the church of St. Clement in Ohrid (now housed in the National Museum in Ohrid), from the church of St. George in the Vlach district of the city, from an unidentified church in Ohrid or its surrounding (now kept in the National Museum in Belgrade) from St. Panteleimon in Nerezi, and the those from the church of St. Nicholas at Korenica. The Royal Doors from Prisovjani bear two key features from the above mentioned works, the carving and the painting. The carving is distinct by the concept of the tablets, and the motifs: the interlacing ornament, known as 'Solomon's seal', the running meander, and the ornament resembling a maggoty effect. The style of the icon painting, and the manner in which the depiction of Archangel Michael and the Holy Virgin were achieved had led previous scholars to believe that these works were accomplished under the influence of the Cretan painting of this period.
