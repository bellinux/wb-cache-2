5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the show {{with a duration of}} 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown {{over the top}} rope and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and HÃ©ctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle, but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Final Resolution was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Monty Brown. On the December 24 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, authority figure Dusty Rhodes announced a Three Way Elimination match for Final Resolution involving Brown, Kevin Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). The winner of said match would challenge Jarrett for the NWA Championship in the main event. A Three Way Elimination match involves three competitors fighting to eliminate each man by pinfall, submission, or throwing one another over the top rope and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> until there is one left. Brown defeated Nash and DDP at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity to challenge Jarrett.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam and Shelton Benjamin. Both Van Dam and Benjamin started the match with high spots as Benjamin {{performed}} a Sunset Flip Powerbomb, a move in which a wrestler will roll/flip over an elevated opponent facing them in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The match {{went back and forth}} with action, but in the end Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash on Benjamin and pinned him to win the match and retain his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{scheduled}} bout was a Three Way Elimination {{match between}} DDP, Kevin Nash, and Monty Brown. The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to fall over the top rope and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> With Nash eliminated, it was down to Brown and DDP. After the two fought back and forth for a few minutes, Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he ran against the opposite ropes and performed a running shoulder block {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} event in the 17th century was the installation of two brand new bells, one bearing the inscription [...] "Venite Exultemus Domino", or [...] "Come, let us rejoice in the Lord" [...] (dated 1684), and the other bearing the inscription [...] "Gloria in Altissimus Deo", or [...] "Glory to God in the highest" [...] (dated 1683). These are still in use through bell-ropes, which have been replaced {{several times in the}} intervening centuries and extend <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> next to the clock mechanism, which is dated 1898 and is wholly mechanical, powering a clock whose two faces can be seen on both the western and eastern sides of the bell tower.|$|E

On June 19, 2002, NWAâTNA held its first show: a weekly pay-per-view (PPV) event.

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Insane Clown Posse albums, The Tempest is {{not connected}} to the Dark Carnival mythology, which {{formed the basis for}} ICP's [...] "Joker's Cards" [...] series, which began in 1992 with Carnival of Carnage and concluded with the albums [...] and Hell's Pit; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums. Joseph Bruce (Violent J) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, [...] "That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way up into the sky, and then you go shooting <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm {{in the form of a}} roller coaster." [...] As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
2500|$|Another early {{design was}} the [...] "Safety Hood and Smoke Protector" [...] invented by Garrett Morgan in 1912, and {{patented}} in 1914. [...] It {{was a simple}} device consisting of a cotton hood with two hoses which hung <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> allowing the wearer to breathe the safer air found there. In addition, moist sponges were inserted {{at the end of}} the hoses in order to better filter the air. This was later modified to include its own air supply, leading to World War I era gas masks.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts differ if Bogan {{drew his}} {{revolver}} {{or that he}} already had an unholstered revolver behind his back. Nonetheless, after learning that Gunn was armed, Bogan yelled [...] "then turn her loose" [...] before quickly whipping his gun and shooting Gunn in the stomach. As Gunn fell face <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> Gunn pulled his own pistol, {{but before he could}} bring it up Bogan ran over and shot him point blank in the head, killing him. Bogan was so close when he fired this second shot, that the muzzle flash caught Gunn's hair on fire. Bogan brandished his pistol at the shocked patrons, and ran out, mounting a horse belonging to Jack Andrews. However, Deputy Marshal John Owens was quick to respond, and blocked Bogan's only exit from town. Owens fired one blast into the air as a warning, and when Bogan continued riding forward, Owens shot him in the shoulder, knocking Bogan from his saddle and into the street.|$|E

2500|$|All {{three large}} {{compositions}} show the banquet {{taking place in}} the open air or a loggia with a grand architectural setting but with the sky visible, and include a raised terrace closing off the back of the pictorial space. In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are steps in the foreground leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of the marble floor gives a similar visual effect. [...] Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them. [...] All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of Paolo Veronese, nearly a century earlier, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563, Louvre) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573, Accademia, Venice). [...] Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition. [...] In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of trompe l'oeil architecture by Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna embracing the whole space.
