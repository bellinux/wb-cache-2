5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E

5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E
5|$|Following the Pakrac {{clash between}} Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence.

In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF had taken over Anbar, <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> Fallujah ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates.

While in this post, Dutton returned to Iraq to command Multi-national Division (South-East) in 2005, where he attracted media attention through outspoken remarks alleging Iranian support for the <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> Iraq. His last field post, as a lieutenant general, was as Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. He held the position from 2008 to 2009, during {{the peak of the}} Taliban insurgency, and assisted American General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of ISAF, in redesigning the military strategy to combat the insurgency.

The Brioni Agreement established an observer mission which was eventually called the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the disengagement of belligerents in the Ten-Day War in neighbouring Slovenia, and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western Slavonia, injuring one of the pilots. This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.|$|E

5|$|Formed as {{a fighter}} wing in November 1943, No.78 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at Malta on garrison duties with the Royal Air Force, operating two squadrons of DeHavilland Vampire jet fighters. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, it deployed with Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons to Malaya in 1958–59, flying sorties against communist <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> {{the final years of}} the Emergency. In the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, and supplied the equipment and personnel for the RAAF contingent operating from Ubon Air Base in Thailand.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army, primarily in Java. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar Uprising, a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity, the United States of Indonesia. During his year in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto's vice-president, {{and went on to}} succeed him as President. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java. Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops. His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism.|$|E
5|$|Jaime I {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, {{less than two months}} after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. The ship was ready to go to sea by 1917, but she was not completed until well {{after the end of the}} war; work was finally finished on 20 December 1921. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Jaime I saw action against <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> Morocco in the Rif War during the early 1920s along with her two sisters. Rif insurgents operating a coastal battery damaged the ship in 1924.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
5|$|On 28September, the 6th Company of the German 920th Landesschützen (Local Defence) Battalion was {{captured}} by <b>insurgents</b> <b>in</b> the town of Gornji Milanovac. According to the journalist Misha Glenny, the Partisans launched {{an attack on a}} small German detachment based at a local school. They did not expect to capture the German garrison, but undertook the attack in order to generate new recruits from the surrounding area. The local Chetnik commander, Zvonimir Vučković, became aware of the Partisan plans and decided to join in the attack to avoid the significant loss of prestige that would result from allowing the Partisans to attack alone. The insurgents launched a morning attack against the school. Although they were successful in overrunning the sentry posts, the Germans' heavy machine guns soon stopped the assault. In 90minutes of fighting, 10Germans were killed and 26wounded. The two insurgent groups judged that continuing the assault would be too costly and Vučković suggested negotiating with the Germans. To the insurgents' surprise, the Germans surrendered. They were then taken away by Vučković and his men.|$|E
