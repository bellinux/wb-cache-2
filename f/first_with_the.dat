5|$|After the Liberation of Bulgaria and the {{establishment}} of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Mutkurov settled in Eastern Rumelia, where he joined the provincial police or militia. He served <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1st Plovdiv Battalion and thereafter with the general staff. As an eminent man of arms in Eastern Rumelia, Mutkurov {{was one of the main}} leaders of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September 1885, the bloodless revolution that united the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Mutkurov joined the Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Central Committee which stood behind the unification. At the time a captain, along with Dimitar Rizov he was envoyed to the Bulgarian monarch Prince Alexander of Battenberg. The two were received by the prince in Shumen, where they notified him of the forthcoming events and requested his approval. The prince did not wish to be publicly involved in an anti-Ottoman revolution, and is unclear whether he at all believed a revolution was likely to break out in Eastern Rumelia so soon. During the revolution, Mutkurov commanded some of the troops that surrounded the residence of the provincial governor Gavril Krastevich and demanded his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot <b>first,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1770s, Joseph also faced {{important}} diplomatic obstacles in consolidating Habsburg influence in Central Europe. When the British had been Austria's allies, Austria {{could count on}} British support in its wars, but Britain was now allied with Prussia. In the Diplomatic Revolution, the French replaced the British as Austria's ally, but they were fickle, as Joseph discovered when Vergennes extricated Versailles from its obligations. Russia, which also had been an important Austrian ally {{for most of the}} Seven Years' War, sought opportunities for expansion at the expense of its weak neighbors. In 1778, that meant Poland and the Ottoman Empire, but Joseph fully understood the danger of appearing weak in Russia's eyes: Habsburg lands could be carved off easily by the cagey Catherine's diplomatic knife. Still, Frederick of Prussia was the most definite enemy, as he had been throughout the reigns of Theresa and Franz before him, when the Prussian state's emergence as a player on the European stage had occurred at Habsburg expense, <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loss of Silesia, and later in the 1750s and 1760s. Joseph sought to unify the different portions of his realm, not the German states as a whole, and to establish Habsburg hegemony in German-speaking central Europe beginning with the partition of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it went into battle at Lepel on 6 July, the corps was at two-thirds of its {{strength}} due to breakdowns. The corps also attacked without air support and with a shortage of anti-aircraft guns, fuel, and ammunition. Alekseyenko deployed the corps in two echelons: the 13th and 17th Tank Divisions attacked <b>first,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 109th Motorised Division in the second echelon. The 17th Tank Division ran into the 17th Panzer Division at Senno on 6 July {{at the beginning of}} the counterattack. The 13th Tank Division was attacked on its left flank by the 18th Panzer Division after advancing farther west than the 17th Tank Division. By 10 July the corps had been mostly destroyed. In the Orsha area the retreating corps was given replacement tanks and ordered to resume the attack the next day. The corps counterattacked toward Vitebsk from the south in conjunction with the 7th Mechanised Corps. Running into the 7th and 12th Panzer Divisions, the combined losses of both corps totalled 100 tanks.|$|E

5|$|Conacher {{played his}} minor hockey with the Toronto Marlboro {{organization}} {{and was a}} member of Ontario provincial championship winning teams at the bantam and midget age groups. He next played junior hockey with the West Toronto Nationals in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) junior league between 1933 and 1936. In his third season, 1935–36, Conacher led the OHA junior league in scoring with 12 goals in 10 games. The Nationals, led by Roy and Bert Conacher, won the OHA title and reached the 1936 Memorial Cup final against the Saskatoon Wesleys. In 12 Memorial Cup playoff games, Roy Conacher recorded eight goals and five assists. West Toronto won the best-of-three final in two consecutive games, 5–1 and 4–2, to capture the Dominion junior championship. Conacher played two seasons of senior hockey, <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Dominions of the OHA senior league in 1936–37 where he was an all-star for the OHA senior championship winning squad. He then played with then the Kirkland Lake Hargreaves of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association.|$|E
5|$|Deane was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911, {{after a period}} as house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was stationed in Meerut {{at the start of}} the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force, landing in Marseille in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the Western Front, where he served <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers: his action earned him a mention in despatches. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga began {{development}} pre-2002 under the working title New Goddess. The game's concept and original draft {{were written by}} Japanese author Yu Godai, but she withdrew from the project for personal reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Atlus scriptwriter Tadashi Satomi. The gameplay concept of the characters transforming into demons was based on an unused idea for Shin Megami Tensei. The second game {{began development}} immediately after the <b>first,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for their story, graphics and gameplay.

In 1909–10, Dunderdale moved east, and played with the Montreal Shamrocks, <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Hockey Association, and later with the National Hockey Association (NHA).

5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually <b>first</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
