Observations revealed that the Baiu front shifted northward with the TC. A simulation integrated from 29 May reproduced both the TC and the northward migration of the Baiu front, whereas the Baiu <b>front</b> <b>stayed</b> stagnant in another simulation integrated from 30 May. Since the TC in the latter simulation developed farther eastward than the observed TC, Yamaura et al. (2013) suggested that the potential extension of the predictability of the Baiu front migration was due to the realistic reproducibility of TCs.|$|R

In May 1918, Greek forces attacked Bulgarian forces and defeated {{them at the}} Battle of Skra-di-Legen on 30 May 1918. Later in 1918, the Allied forces upped up their offensive from Greece into occupied Serbia. In September of that year, Allied forces (French, Greek, Serb, Italian, and British troops), {{under the command of}} French General Louis Franchet d'Espèrey, broke through German, Austro-Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces along the Macedonian front. Bulgaria later signed the Armistice of Salonica with the Allies in Thessaloniki on 29 September 1918. By October, the Allies including the Greeks under French General Louis Franchet d'Espèrey had taken back all of Serbia and were ready to invade Hungary until the Hungarian authorities offered surrender.|$|R

25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, the Soviets made two more attacks on 3 August. Each of them {{began with a}} massive {{artillery}} barrage and ended with a German counterattack, restoring the previous positions. Overall on 3 August, twenty Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Soviet attacks from 4 to 6 August were weaker; on 4 August, eleven tanks were destroyed, and seven more on 5 August. During the night before 6 August, six tanks were knocked out. On 10 August, the war council of the Leningrad Front ordered the termination of the offensive and switch strictly to defense. The Soviets reduced their operations to patrol activities with occasional attacks. The defenders used this respite to rotate several exhausted units {{out of the line}} for a few days for rest and refit, and to strengthen their positions.

50|$|Originally part of Fatah, Fatah al-Intifada {{broke away}} from the {{organization}} in 1983, during the PLO's participation in the Lebanese Civil War. The split was due to differences between Abu Musa and Yassir Arafat over a number of issues, including military decisions and corruption. Fatah al-Intifada was formed with Syrian support and quickly attracted a number of Palestinian guerrillas disillusioned with Arafat's role in Fatah and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). There was also a political dimension: the organization took a more leftist view than the generally apolitical Fatah, and used socialist phraseology. Abu Musa is known to have advocated the view that the Lebanese Civil War was not a sectarian conflict, but a form of class war. Syria provided extensive backing as the Abu Musa forces attacked Arafat loyalists in Fatah, while several radical PLO organizations in the Rejectionist <b>Front</b> <b>stayed</b> on the sidelines. The fighting led to heavy losses on both sides, and helped Syria extend its influence into Palestinian-held areas of Lebanon.|$|R
5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{atmospheric}} circulation fields during the baiu in Japan with global warming under the RCP scenarios. We use projection experimental data conducted using a 20 km-, 60 km-mesh global atmospheric model (MRI-AGCM 3. 2). The baiu front {{indicated by the}} north-south gradient of moist static energy moves northward in present-day climate, whereas this northward shift in future climate simulations is very slow during May and June. In future late baiu season, the baiu <b>front</b> <b>stays</b> {{in the northern part}} of Japan even in August. As a result, the rich water vapor is transported around western Japan and the daily precipitation amount will increase in August. In the mid-troposphere, the horizontal warm advection roughly corresponds to upward vertical pressure velocity, and shows northward migration as seen in the lower troposphere. Especially, the RCP 8. 5 scenario is delayed compared to the RCP 4. 5 scenario. This tendency is evident in the north-south term of 500 -hPa warm advection in particular. In conclusion, a late of the baiu rainfall band northward and an increase in precipitation during late of the baiu season are apparent from the point of view of atmospheric fields...|$|R

40|$|A coupled ocean-atmosphere {{regional}} model suggests {{a mechanism for}} formation of a sharp sea surface temperature (SST) front north of the equator in the eastern Pacific Ocean in boreal summer and fall. Meridional convergence of Ekman transport at 5 ◦ N is forced by eastward turning of the southeasterly crossequatorial wind, but the SST front forms considerably south of the maximum Ekman convergence. Geostrophic equatorward flow at 3 ◦ N in {{the lower half of}} the isothermally mixed layer enhances mixed-layer convergence. Cold water is upwelled on or south of the equator and is advected poleward by mean mixed-layer flow and by eddies. The mixed-layer current convergence in the north confines the cold advection, so the SST <b>front</b> <b>stays</b> close to the equator. Warm advection from the north and cold advection from the south strengthens the front. In the southern hemisphere, continuous southwestward current advects cold water far from the upwelling core. The cold tongue is warmed by the net surface flux, which is dominated by solar radiation. Evaporation and net surface cooling are at a maximum just north of the SST front where relatively cool dry air is advected northward over warm SST. The surface heat flux is decomposed into a response to SST alone, and an atmospheric feedback. The atmospheric feedback enhances cooling on the north side of the front by 178 W m− 2, about half of which is due to enhanced evaporation from cold dry advection, and the other half is due to cloud radiative forcing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Moist {{idealized}} baroclinic-wave simulations {{show the}} development of precipitation bands from a zonally uniform initial midlatitude jet. For a frictionless lower boundary, andwith no latent-heat release or surface heat andmoisture fluxes, warm advection is strong and a bent-back warm front forms. Although a narrow vertical-velocity maximum forms within the area of synoptic-scale ascent near the triple point, only a wide warm-frontal band forms. As surface roughness length increases between simulations to that of an ocean then a land surface, warm advection is reduced and the cold front becomes stronger relative to the warm front. A separate narrow rainband forms along the cold front, which ismore intense and farther removed from thewidewarm-frontal bandwhen roughness length is greater. In the simulation with roughness length appropriate to the ocean, after the narrow band decays, the precipitation becomes oriented along thewarmconveyor belt in thewarm sector. When latent-heat release is included, this warm-sector precipitation evolves into multiple bands, which eventually weaken with the cyclone. When surface heat and moisture fluxes are included, the ascent at the surface cold <b>front</b> <b>stays</b> strong and a well-defined cold front of the anafront variety persists through this mature stage. The surface precipitation remains in a single intense band along and ahead of the cold front. Therefore, strong surface heat and moisture fluxes inhibit multiple bands, but a simu-lation with lower sea surface temperature (SST) more closely resembles the simulation without surface heat and moisture fluxes, demonstrating that the detailed structure and evolution of precipitation banding is sensitive to SST. 1...|$|R

40|$|Maxwell {{theory is}} usually {{treated in the}} lab frame under the {{standard}} time order (light-signal clock synchronization). Particle tracking in the lab frame usually treats time as an independent variable. Then, the evolution of electron beams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard clock synchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator community. There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first, Lorentz's way, consists in `translating' Maxwell's electrodynamics to the absolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists in `translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture. Conventional particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes after a transverse kick, while {{the orientation of the}} microbunching <b>fronts</b> <b>stays</b> unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time order, in the ultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is always perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the production of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in the kicked direction without suppression. We hold a recent FEL study at the LCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after a large kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result invoking the aberration of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling fields and particles. Here we give details of the Lorentz's approach used in that paper. We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation' of particle tracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the strong qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments. Previous simulation results in ultrarelativistic electron beam physics should be reexamined {{in the light of the}} difference between particle tracking and electromagnetic world-pictures...|$|R
40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. Past {{measurements}} off {{the coast}} of central Oregon and Washington have shown that the rapid change from northward monthly mean winter winds to southward summer winds forces a "spring transition" of the coastal ocean: sea levels and temperatures drop, and mean surface currents shift from northward to southward. Current and water temperature data from 35 °N to 48 °N from 1981 and 1982, and sea level and wind stress data from 1971 - 1975 and 1980 - 1983, show the transition to have a large alongshore scale, typically 500 to 2000 km; the large-scale wind stress appears to be the forcing mechanism at latitudes north of approximately 37 °N. South of 37 °N, sea level usually falls more gradually before the northern transition event. Both wind and sea level events generally progress from south to north over a 3 - to 10 -day period, but this is not always true. Several aspects of the spring transition reflect coastal trapped wave dynamics. Previous studies at 45 °N found persistent vertical shear of the southward summer current, associated with a cross-shelf density gradient. During 1982 the shear and the density front develop over the shelf break immediately after the transition at 43 °N and to the south, but they are much less persistent than at 48 °N. The stronger winds between 38 °N and 42 °N and the narrower shelf result in an offshore displacement of the density front and vertical shear past the shelf break, leaving the water over the shelf less stratified and more subject to barotropic reversals of the current than that farther north, where the <b>front</b> <b>stays</b> closer to the coast...|$|R
