40|$|Many {{problems}} of comparative genomics involve analysis of orthologous genes. Rigorous determination of orthology relationships requires {{construction of a}} large number of phylogenetic trees. A reasonable approximation is to consider bidirectional best hits (BETs) as done, for example, in the COG system (Tatusov et al., 1997). Two genes g from genome A and h from genome B form a BET if the similarity between these genes s(g,h) exceeds the similarity for any other choice of either member of the pair: s(g,h) >s(g,y) and s(g,h) >s(x,h) for any x≠g from A and y≠h from B. GenomeExplorer (Mironov et al., 2000) has convenient tools for manual analysis of orthologues. However, large scale analyses require tools for automated processing of gene complements. Orthologator is a set of programs for identification of BET pairs in bacterial genomes. It uses BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) for identification of homologues.

The integral equation governing the problem {{is transformed into a}} severely ill-conditioned set of linear equations whose approximate solution is obtained through regularisation methods. A proposal, with the aim of taking into account the possible non-null initial conditions of the physical system, is suggested together with an algorithm that allows the definition of long impulse responses with limited computing effort. The implementation developed can deal with single <b>input</b> single <b>output,</b> single <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> and multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> systems and has been tested both numerically and on two simple real structures.

The flaw characterization problem thus reduces to determining the kernel of the convolution integral given the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>time</b> signals.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the efficacy of}} feedback control in improving the performance of computing systems. Computing systems typically have many competing performance goals which are affected by several external variables. A feedback control strategy is desirable because well established techniques exist to handle these performance trade-offs and external disturbances. In order to employ such a strategy, decisions {{need to be made}} about <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> sample <b>time,</b> model type, and performance measures. This paper describes this process, which is often nebulous for computing systems, {{in the context of an}} Apache web server. A linear multi <b>input</b> multi <b>output</b> model of the system is identified experimentally and used to design several feedback controllers. Experimental results are presented showing the problems associated with a pure pole placement design and the effectiveness of LQR based techniques. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work. ...|$|R

The main idea is {{to put together the}} system identification process and the deadbeat control design into a unified step. It starts with reformulating the conventional multi-step output-prediction equation to explicitly include the coefficient matrices to weight past <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>time</b> histories for computation of feedback control force. The formulation thus derived satisfies simultaneously the system identification and the deadbeat control requirements. As soon as the coefficient matrices are identified satisfying the output prediction equation, no further work is required to design a deadbeat controller.

Linear Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) dynamic models can be identified, with no a priori knowledge of model structure or order, {{using a new}} Generalised Identifying Filter (GIF). Based on an Extended Kalman Filter, the new filter identifies the model iteratively, in a continuous modal canonical form, using only <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>time</b> histories. The filter’s self-propagating state error covariance matrix allows easy determination of convergence and conditioning, and by progressively increasing model order, the best fitting reduced-order model can be identified.

The process representation, approach, and scale used in each model can vary greatly among scientific domains. In addition, many models use proprietary data <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> file formats {{making it difficult to}} share results among scientists. These factors limit the extent to which cross disciplinary models can grow, and as a result, restricts collaboration across academic disciplines.

40|$|In real sound {{environment}} system, {{a specific}} signal shows {{various types of}} probability distribution, and the observation data are usually contaminated by external noise (e. g., background noise) of non-Gaussian distribution type. Furthermore, there potentially exist various nonlinear correlations {{in addition to the}} linear correlation between <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>time</b> series. Consequently, often the system <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> relationship in the real phenomenon cannot be represented by a simple model using only the linear correlation and lower order statistics. In this study, complex sound environment systems difficult to analyze by using usual structural method are considered. By introducing an estimation method of the system parameters reflecting correlation information for conditional probability distribution under existence of the external noise, a prediction method of output response probability for sound environment systems is theoretically proposed in a suitable form for the additive property of energy variable and the evaluation in decibel scale. The effectiveness of the proposed stochastic signal processing method is experimentally confirmed by applying it to the observed data in sound environment systems...|$|R

40|$|Ship motions are {{influenced}} by the sea state. Conventionally the responses are calculated in the frequency domain. This method, however, is valid only for narrow band spectra. As the seaway becomes more nonlinear, the ship motions cannot be readily predicted using the spectral method. Experiments conducted by Dalzell, have shown that the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) decreased with increasing sea state or non linearity. Conventionally in the shipbuilding industry, the ship motions are studied by the linear RAOs and the energy density spectrum of the seaway. This method does not take into consideration any non linearities in the system. These are ignored and the ship seaway system is modeled linearly.
