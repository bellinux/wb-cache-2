40|$|Like other Saharan regions, the Algerian {{development}} program of agricultural land has increased agricultural {{area in the}} valley of M’Zab. Creating development zones in the Valley of M’zab generated some momentum {{with a series of}} measures with different impacts on the components of this agro-ecosystem. Its dynamics have shown particular shortcomings at different levels thus compromising durability. The measures to be taken are justified not only to preserve the ecosystem but also to give meaning to the strong <b>investments</b> made <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{countries}} of the Mediterranean and Balkan regions share a peculiar characteristic: more than 80 % of the sheep milk and 50 % of the goat milk collected worldwide come from this area. Such milks are often the main production of small farms in less favoured regions where they are generally used to make specific and typical cheeses (without cow milk). These products generally have a good image {{and most of these}} countries are big cheese consumers. After a general presentation of the sector (milk production, cheese making, and consumption) and of recent changes in the four main zones of the region, the authors analyse their advantages, difficulties and stakes, underlining the similarities and differences between the Latin and Balkan countries. Three types of production and supply chain are identified according to volumes, markets, types and levels of organisation: some specific specialised sectors, micro-sectors, regionally disseminated activities without coordinated cheese units. The authors study the probable or possible changes in consumption, distribution, dairy firm strategies, production systems and political or institutional changes in the European Union. Three scenarios are proposed. The future of this sector will probably depend largely on the future standards of living, the consumption habits and the level of <b>investment</b> <b>by</b> regional <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> as these supply chains offer good leverage for territorial development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} research focused on highlighting {{the impact of}} financial crisis on foreign direct investments (FDI) level in Romania and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Going further, this paper aims to analyze in more detailed the impact of major macroeconomic factors on territorial distribution of FDI in Romania, during the period 2006 – 2012. We must be aware that, FDI can be influenced <b>by</b> <b>investments</b> made <b>by</b> the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> regarding the infrastructure, education or other social aspect. In this context, {{in order to improve}} the level of FDI in a specific region, we have to know what will be most viable tool to utilize to achieve it. For accomplishing this, we will use a regression model and panel data methodology, which will help us to identify the influence of several macroeconomic variables on FDI value recorded by each region. The present study is important in supporting the regulatory environment, in order to attract more FDI, as a solution for economic development of specific regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInvestment {{decision}} {{rules in}} risk situations have been extensively analyzed for firms. Most research focus on financial options {{and the wide}} range of methods based on dynamic programming currently used by firms to decide on whether and when to implement an irreversible investment under uncertainty. The situation is quite different for public investments, which are decided and largely funded <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>authorities.</b> These <b>investments</b> are assessed <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> not through market criteria, but through public Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) procedures. Strangely enough, these procedures pay little attention to risk and uncertainty. The present text aims at filling this gap. We address the classic problem of whether and when an investment should be implemented. This stopping time problem is established in a framework where the discount rate is typically linked to GDP, which follows a Brow-nian motion, and where the benefits and cost of implementation follow linked Brownian motions. We find that the decision rule depends on a threshold value of the First Year Ad-vantage/Cost ratio. This threshold can be expressed in a closed form including the means, standard deviations and correlations of the stochastic variables. Simulations with sensible current values of these parameters show that the systemic risk, coming from the correlation between the benefits of the investment and economic growth, is not that high, and that more attention should be paid to risks relating to the construction cost of the investment; furthermore, simple rules of thumb are designed for estimating the above mentioned threshold. Some extensions are explored. Others are suggested for further research...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} characteristics of the world economy today is the enormous, ever worsening US balance of payments current account deficit, which reached a record level of 5. 7 p. c. of GDP in 2004. This has given rise to concerns in academic and political circles regarding the sustainability of the current situation and the potential dangers for the global economy of a sudden, disorderly adjustment. The size of the US current account deficit is not only unprecedented in American post-war history, but it also seems to be exceptional from an international perspective. Moreover, the US deficit contrasts with a surplus in virtually every other region and the problem has consequently taken on a global dimension. The increase in the US current account deficit recorded in the nineties reflects an internal American shortfall in savings. Whereas the private savings-investment equilibrium was restored in 2002 and 2003, the same period saw a huge deficit in the public sector budget. The start of the new millennium brought notable changes in the way the US current account deficit was financed since <b>investments</b> <b>by</b> Asian <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> in American government debt instruments largely took over the position previously occupied by European private foreign direct investments and investments in equities. It is sometimes put forward that the US, unlike other countries facing similar circumstances, is safeguarded from an attack on its currency because of its prominent role in the international financial system. According to an influential school of thought in economic literature, the current international system can even be seen as a “revived” Bretton Woods system. Indeed, a number of East-Asian countries, including China, use a fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate against the dollar, which brings to mind an informal dollar standard. Although this set of circumstances has undoubtedly offered various regions in the world a number of mutual benefits during recent years, these exchange rate relations may nevertheless have caused some distortions in US spending, whereas Asian countries have to deal with a growing exchange rate risk on their official reserves. Different scenarios are conceivable to deal with the global imbalances. The results of model simulations show the huge effort required to significantly reduce the US current account deficit which highlights the scale of the problem, emphasising the need for simultaneous economic policy measures in the different economies involved. The concern over global imbalances and the development of exchange rates also feature prominently on the agenda of international forums such as the G 7 or G 20 meetings. In the statements issued at those meetings, the need for a common approach to tackle the global imbalances is given priority and the belief that excessive exchange rate volatility is not desirable is underlined. current account imbalances, United States current account, financial flows into the United States, international monetary system...|$|R
