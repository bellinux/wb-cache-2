5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into <b>fairings.</b> The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in <b>fairings</b> {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped <b>fairings</b> over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow <b>fairings,</b> and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|Two {{airframe}} configurations {{were tested}} during the prototype stage. The first configuration was tested {{on the first}} three prototype aircraft; PT-01, PT-02, and PT-03. The next three prototypes PT-04, PT-05, and PT-06 were of the second configuration, incorporating modifications such as DSI, wider LERX, extended ventral fins, and a taller, less swept vertical stabiliser with a rectangular fairing at the tip containing electronic warfare equipment and small blister <b>fairings</b> at the base containing Missile Approach Warning sensors. The PT-04 prototype was primarily used for avionics and weapon qualification tests. Prototype-01 first flew in August 2003; Prototype-03 followed in April 2004. On 10 May 2006, Prototype 04 made its maiden flight.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge <b>fairings</b> failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic <b>fairings</b> with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped <b>fairings</b> on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined <b>fairings</b> on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing <b>fairings</b> and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{twist and}} belly <b>fairings</b> are tweaked to {{approach}} the lowest drag elliptical span-wise pressure distribution changed by the larger sharklets, like the flap track <b>fairings</b> shape to lower form drag.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe {{was performed to}} reduce drag. New aerodynamic <b>fairings</b> were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor. The skid landing gear also had streamlined <b>fairings</b> applied to it and the rotor mast {{was replaced by a}} mast that could be tilted in-flight.|$|E
25|$|The trains were {{originally}} delivered with M>Train {{blue and green}} stripes on the side, and the M>Train 'swirl' on the front fairing. Later deliveries entering service in bare metal on the sides, and white front <b>fairings</b> with a green and yellow striped bar. On entering Connex Melbourne ownership, blue and yellow stripes were progressively added {{to the side of}} all trains, and front <b>fairings</b> were repainted yellow with the blue Connex logo.|$|E
25|$|Local {{cakes and}} desserts include Saffron cake, Cornish heavy (hevva) cake, Cornish <b>fairings</b> biscuits, figgy 'obbin, Cream tea and {{whortleberry}} pie.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is a 4130 {{welded steel}} tube cage {{covered in a}} non-structural fibreglass skin. The tail group {{is a mix of}} fibreglass <b>fairings</b> and aluminum surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Rafale had a fixed wide track, {{tailskid}} undercarriage. Its wheels were on vertical, slender aerofoil section {{legs from}} {{the wings and}} were largely enclosed within magnesium alloy <b>fairings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Challengers can be {{identified}} visually by their distinctive double slotted hinged flap design, where the <b>fairings</b> can be seen below the wings, a sight much more common on commercial airliners.|$|E
25|$|Class 5 hang gliders have a rigid primary {{structure}} with movable aerodynamic surfaces {{as the primary}} method of control and can safely take-off and land in nil-wind conditions. No pilot <b>fairings</b> are permitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} A-17 {{was equipped}} with perforated flaps, and had fixed landing gear with partial <b>fairings.</b> It was fitted with an internal fuselage bomb bay that carried fragmentation bombs and well as external bomb racks.|$|E
25|$|A G-II (N10123, cn 107) had tip tanks added {{containing}} ground mapping radar, {{along with}} <b>fairings</b> {{on the wing}} undersurface and a centerline pod. This aircraft operated as the Calgis Geosar and is now owned by Earthdata Aviation.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{damage to}} the housing or {{components:}} Damage such as cracked housings, torn or dislodged mouthpieces, damaged exhaust <b>fairings,</b> can cause gas flow problems or leaks, or can make the regulator uncomfortable to use or difficult to breathe from.|$|E
25|$|Model for the US LSA market, {{based on}} the Harmony airframe, with {{enlarged}} ailerons and rudder to improve crosswind capabilities, an improved wing, winglets and tail, wider and longer cockpit, as well as refined wheel pants and other <b>fairings.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{mainline}} qualifications, RM 31 {{has been}} fitted with an events recorder, train radio, and ditch lights at either end. These are recessed into the railcar's front <b>fairings</b> {{so as not to}} detract from the original character of the railcar.|$|E
25|$|Moto Guzzi {{produced}} competitive race machines, and by 1957 {{nearly all}} the Grand Prix races were being won by streamlined machines. The following year, 1958, full enclosure <b>fairings</b> were banned from racing by the FIM {{in the light of}} the safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The Minotaur ground-launched rockets combine Pegasus upper stages {{with either}} government-supplied or commercially {{available}} first-stage rocket motors to boost larger payloads to orbit. Minotaur IV combines decommissioned Peacekeeper rocket motors with proven Orbital avionics and <b>fairings</b> to provide increased lifting capacity for government-sponsored payloads.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{featured a}} strut-braced high-wing, a {{six to eight}} seat enclosed cabin and optional fixed tricycle landing gear, conventional landing gear, floats or skis and a single engine in tractor configuration. The Ranger differed from the AL-60 in having main landing gear leg <b>fairings</b> and Hoerner wing tips.|$|E
25|$|A {{tricycle}} undercarriage was fitted, with the nosewheel retracting forwards. The single-wheel main legs retracted into coverless <b>fairings</b> in the wings, {{so that the}} sides of the wheels could be seen even when retracted. The wings themselves, unusually, had a different airfoil cross-section on the inner wings than the outer.|$|E
25|$|The {{wing area}} (14.4 m²) {{was a little}} less than the famous 15 m² of the Nieuport - the gap between the wings was reduced slightly, and the interplane struts were of steel tube, with broad wooden <b>fairings,</b> in place of the tape wrapped wooden struts of the original.|$|E
25|$|The Charger Daytona {{introduced}} to the public had a fiberglass nose without real headlamps and a wing without streamlined <b>fairings.</b> The media and public loved the car, but were mystified by the reverse scoops on the front fenders. The PR representatives claimed it was for tire clearance. Actually, they reduced drag 3%.|$|E
25|$|M.S.325 C3 No. 01 (Works no. 4120) {{was flown}} {{for the first}} time by company Chief Test Pilot Michael Détroyat early in 1933 from the factory site, Vèlizy-Villacoublay. The first test results were not {{satisfactory}} as tail buffeting was encountered leading to modifications that included lowering the tailplane and adding wing root <b>fairings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following flight {{trials of}} the XKD4R target drone, {{developed}} for the United States Navy, Radioplane redesigned the aircraft into an improved version, designated RP-76, first flying in 1959. Compared to the XKD4R, the RP-76 had redesigned wing <b>fairings,</b> with the vertical control fin being moved to {{the underside of the}} missile, as opposed to being on top.|$|E
25|$|Streetfighters {{are derived}} from sport bikes, {{originally}} being customized sport bikes with the <b>fairings</b> removed and higher handlebars replacing the low clip-on handlebars. Since the 1990s, factory streetfighters have been produced. As with naked bike and muscle bike (below), the name streetfighter is used to help clarify the middle ground occupied by designs that blend elements of both sport bikes and standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, {{which was}} designed by {{a team led by}} Ed Heinemann resembled a scaled-down Northrop Delta. It was a low-winged monoplane, of all-metal stressed skin construction. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with its main gear fitted with streamlining trouser <b>fairings.</b> The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit with a sliding canopy. It was powered by a single Wright R-1510 radial engine.|$|E
25|$|Standards {{usually do}} not come with <b>fairings</b> or windscreens, or if they have them, they are {{relatively}} small. Standard is often a synonym for naked bike, a term that became popular in the 1990s {{in response to the}} proliferation of fully faired sport bikes. The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling nostalgia for the return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-4/U8 — The A-4/U8 was the Jabo-Rei (Jagdbomber Reichweite, {{long-range}} fighter-bomber), adding twin standard Luftwaffe 300L (80US gal) drop tanks, {{one under}} each wing, on VTr-Ju 87 racks with duralumin <b>fairings</b> produced by Weserflug, and a centreline bomb rack. The outer wing-mounted 20mm MG FF/M cannon and the cowling-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 were removed to save weight. The A-4/U8 was the precursor of the Fw 190 G-1.|$|E
25|$|The first IAR 330 NAVAL {{helicopter}} was officially unveiled at Ghimbav on 30 January 2007. The Romanian Naval Forces ordered three of this variant. The helicopter is {{in a similar}} configuration to the Romanian Air Force variant, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy aircraft also have flotation gear fitted under the nose and main undercarriage <b>fairings.</b> They are operated from Navy frigates for search and rescue, medevac and maritime surveillance missions.|$|E
