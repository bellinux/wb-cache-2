Various methods have been applied to remove this <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> from water and wastewater.

The novelty of this system is improved biological denitrification by immobilizing autohydrogenotrophic bacteria directly {{on the surface of}} a cathode, providing easy access to NO 3 - and H 2 as the electron acceptor and electron donor, respectively. The system effectiveness depends on the configuration of reactor, and the operational and environmental parameters.

40|$|Abstract—The {{pollution}} of soils by organic contaminants, such as phenols, {{is a serious}} problem because of the high toxicity and persistence in the environment. Mechanochemical treatments (MTs) of polluted soils with minerals, such as clays and oxides, which have surfaces that exhibit catalytic properties, have been suggested to be a new useful strategy to promote both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> degradation. Nevertheless, much still remains to be studied about the capability of clays to promote pollutant removal by means of the mechanochemical activation of the mineral surfaces. This work investigates the efficiency of the mineral kaolinite in promoting the sequestration of catechol (CAT) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) by MT. A well crystallized kaolinite (KGa- 1 b) was milled for prolonged times with different amounts of organic molecules so as to obtain two different clay:organic compound ratios. Prolonged grinding and a higher clay mineral:organic compound ratio were found to be more effective in promoting a stronger removal than simple contact.

Three sub-LPIs in terms of LPI in organic pollutant (LPI), LPI in <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (LPI) and LPIor in in heavy metals (LPI) as well as overall LPI had been developed and reported. It can be noted that componenthm of organic fraction in leachate for entire lysimeter operating system had highest against the other counter fraction i. e. inorganic and heavy metals fraction and consequently shows the highest LPI than that of LPIor in and LPI. it can be observed that sub-LPIs and overall LPI has decreased in relation to the increasing ofhm elapsed period of MSW deposited in landfill lysimeter.

Numerous organic and inorganic pollutants usually discharged into the water caused carcinogenic or toxic effect for human and different life form. In this respect, this work aims to treat water contaminated by organic and inorganic waste using sorbent based on polystyrene. Therefore, two different series of adsorbent material were prepared; the first one included the preparation of polymeric sorbent from the reaction of styrene acrylate ester and alkyl acrylate. The second series involved syntheses of composite ion exchange resins of waste polystyrene and amorphous carbon thin film (WPS/ACTF) by solvent evaporation using micro emulsion polymerization. The produced ACTF/WPS nanocomposite was sulfonated to produce cation exchange resins ACTF/WPSS nanocomposite. The sorbents of the first series were characterized using FTIR, 1 H NMR, and gel permeation chromatography. The thermal properties of the cross-linked sorbents were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, and the morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The removal of organic pollutant was determined through absorption tests in a various organic solvent. The chemical and crystalline structure of nanocomposite of second series has been proven by studies of FTIR spectrum, X-rays, thermal analysis, SEM and TEM analysis to study morphology of resins and ACTF that assembled with polystyrene chain. It is found that the composite resins ACTF/WPSS are thermally stable and show higher chemical stability than ion exchange WPSS resins. The composite resin was evaluated for calcium hardness removal.

Besides, urban parks {{are also important}} habitats for biodiversity (Nielsen et al. 2014), which being valuable by itself provides also a range of other services (Haase et al. 2014). However, soil biodiversity is currently poorly known, especially in Mediterranean cities, and relatively uninvestigated are the environmental factors determining its structure and persistence. To fill this gap, we explored the environmental factors affecting soil biodiversity of Collembola and earthworms (good indicators of soil biological quality), in parks of two cities: Naples (Italy) and Montpellier (France). The investigated factors were soil <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> contents, vegetation cover (with or without canopy) and urban landscape features.

Collembola communities are both strongly affected by urban park management practices. In particular, the canopy cover was the main determinant of the Collembola community structure, which strikingly differed between areas with or without canopy. Landscape features, followed by soil local conditions, like the presence of litter and soil porosity, also influenced Collembola communities. Abundance of earthworms was greater in ecologically managed systems compared to conventionally managed systems.

It was 1328 bp containing an open reading frame of 624 bp, encoding 208 amino acid residues with a predicted protein molecular weight of 23. 67 kDa and an estimated pI of 5. 67. Sequence analysis showed that the predicted protein sequence of abGSTsigma cDNA contained the conserved domain of the GST_N_Sigma_like (PSSM: cd 03039) and GST_C_Sigma_like (PSSM: cd 03192). Alignment analysis demonstrated that the abGSTsigma of H. diversicolor was in a branch position with other known class sigma GSTs from different organisms. The abGSTsigma mRNA was distributed in multiple tissues tested and was highly demonstrated in the gill and mantle of normal abalones. In bacteria-challenged abalone, the abGSTsigma gene was significantly expressed in the hemocytes, gill, mantle and digestive gland and the total GSTs enzyme and SOD were also induced in the four tissues. The increased activities of SOD and GSTs can result in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicating antioxidant activities involved. The preliminary work revealed that the sigma class glutathione S-transferase gene abGSTsigma, a phase 11 detoxification enzyme, had a positive response to bacterial challenge, and that will lead to an insightful study on elucidating the interactions between immune responses and biotransformation exerted by abGSTsigma.

The major pollution indicator parameters were the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), suspended solids (SS), colour and heavy metals levels. The effluent was highly turbid and coloured with average organic and inorganic loadings of 1766 kg COD. day- 1 and 964 kg TDS. day- 1 respectively. Overall mean COD, TDS and SS levels of the effluent were 5849 mgl- 1, 3193 mgl- 1 and 521 mgl- 1 respectively. Cu, Fe and Cr (VI) levels were less than 4 mgL- 1. Analysis of the BOD curves revealed an initial lag in microbial activity of between 1 - 2 days indicating the presence of non-persistent toxic substances that affect microbial activity. After the initial lag an average BOD rate constant (KL) value of 0. 55 day- 1 was obtained, which was above the acceptable sewer discharge limit of 0. 17 day- 1. BOD 5 :COD ratios ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 5 indicating that the effluent contained a large proportion of non-biodegradable organic matter.

The {{production of}} H_ 2 was enhanced by the addition of As(III) during the course of water electrolysis. The synergistic effect of As(III) on H_ 2 production can be explained in terms of (1) the scavenging of reactive chlorine species (RCS), which inhibit the production of H_ 2 by competing with water molecules (or protons) for the electrons on the cathode, by As(III) and (2) the generation of protons, which are more favorably reduced on the cathode than water molecules, through the oxidation of As(III). The addition of 1. 0 mM As(III) to the electrolyte at a constant cell voltage (E_(cell)) of 3. 0 V enhanced the production of H 2 by 12 % even though the cell current (I_(cell)) was reduced by 5 %. The net effect results in an increase in the energy efficiency (EE) for H_ 2 production (ΔEE) by 17. 5 %. Furthermore, the value ΔEE, which depended on As(III) concentration, also depended on the applied E_(cell). For example, the ΔEE increased with increasing As(III) concentration in the micromolar range but decreased as a function of E_(cell). This is attributed {{to the fact that the}} reactions between RCS and As(III) are influenced by both RCS concentration depending on E_(cell) and As(III) concentration in the solution. On the other hand, the ΔEE decreased with increasing As(III) concentration in the millimolar range due to the adsorption of As(V) generated from the oxidation of As(III) on the semiconductor anode. In comparison to the electrochemical oxidation of certain organic compounds (e. g., phenol, 4 -chlorophenol, 2 -chlorophenol, salicylic acid, catechol, maleic acid, oxalate, and urea), the ΔEE obtained during As(III) oxidation (17. 5 %) was higher than that observed during the oxidation of the above organic compounds (ΔEE = 3. 0 – 15. 3 %) with the exception of phenol at 22. 1 %.

Some 16, 593 particles were involved. Sizes such as these place the primary particles of silica fume within the definition of nanometre particles. Similar results for the primary particles of silica fume have been recorded by other workers in the field when the technique of electron microscopy has been used. On the other hand, woodsmoke organics was shown to vary in primary particle size from a minimum CMD of 21 nm (0. 021 µm) to a maximum of 23. 5 nm (0. 023 µm), depending on wood and heater type, while the aggregate size varied from a minimum VMD of 35 nm (0. 035 µm) to a maximum of 58 n (0. 058 µm). Similar sizes were found with a woodsmoke contaminated ambient air sample, with CMD for primary particles of 16 run (0. 016 µm) and VMD for aggregates of 45 nin (0. 045 µm). The woodsmoke sizing represented the analysis of some 10, 194 particles and permits both the primary particles and almost all aggregates of woodsmoke to be defined as nanoparticles. This was in contrast to previous work in the field which was at least a factor of ten larger than the present study for both primary particles and aggregates, a fact which has raised come concern with regard to sizing limitations.

Some microalgae species have been recently tested to degrade an array of pollutants such as phenols, polyphenolic aromatic compounds (PAH) and even hormones (Pollio et. al., 1994. Phytochemistry, 37 : 1269 - 1272;. Pinto et. al., 2003. Biotechnol Lett., 25 : 1657 - 1659). It is worthy to note that about 2, 500 species belong from Chlorophyceae, seldom living in contrasting habitat under severe environmental conditions. So far, a little has been done to exploit this genetic biodiversity bonanza; thus, few reports have been published on enzymes implicated in their degradative action (Semple et. al., 1996. Appl. Envr. Micr, 62 : 1265 - 1273). Since a wide collection of green microalgae species are available at the University of Naples, Department of Biological Science, recently we have started a research aimed to (a) find algae species with extracellular phenoloxidase enzymatic activity; (b) identify extracellular enzymes able to degrade xenobiotic like synthetic dyes and other PAHs; (c) clone and overexpress genes producing phenoloxidases in homologous and in heterologous systems, in order to use these enzymes primarily for phytoremediation of milling oil wastewaters. Among phenoloxidaes, we focused our interest on laccases (EC 1. 10. 3. 2) that are phenol-oxidoreductases able to catalyze the oxidation of various aromatic compounds (particularly phenols) with the concomitant reduction of oxygen to water. Selected algae strains were grown in liquid culture at 22 °C under continuous light conditions, starting with an inoculum of 0. 1 OD. After ten days, the algal growth was measured as optical density at 600 nm. A screening was performed by detecting the laccase activity in the broth medium culture, deprived of algae cells, in the presence of 2, 2 -azino-bis 3 -ethybenz-thiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS) at 420 nm. The laccase activity was referred to the polyphenol oxidase activity of Trametes versicolor; thus, each positive strain was assayed on industrial azo-dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and on the natural phenol compound syringaldazine by kinetic analysis. Preliminary results, obtained comparing different species, showed a wide variation both within the same substrate and among the different microalgae. Microalgae strains able to produce and secrete laccase enzymes were further chosen for more detailed genetic studies. To clone phenoloxidase genes from those species, we have started a bioinformatics approach, on the basis of highly conserved coding sequences of laccases already isolated and sequenced from several higher plants. Primers drawn on the alignment of those sequences have been used to amplify genomic DNA...|$|E
