40|$|The growing {{interest}} in quantifying the molecular basis of protein kinase activation and allosteric regulation by cancer mutations has fueled computational studies of allosteric signaling in protein kinases. In the present study, we combined computer simulations and the energy landscape analysis of protein kinases to characterize the interplay between oncogenic mutations and locally <b>frustrated</b> sites as important catalysts of allostetric kinase activation. While structurally rigid kinase core constitutes a minimally <b>frustrated</b> hub of the catalytic domain, locally <b>frustrated</b> residue clusters, whose interaction networks are not energetically optimized, are prone to dynamic modulation and could enable allosteric conformational transitions. The {{results of this study}} have shown that the energy landscape effect of oncogenic mutations may be allosteric eliciting global changes in the spatial distribution of highly <b>frustrated</b> residues. We have found that mutation-induced allosteric signaling may involve a dynamic coupling between structurally rigid (minimally <b>frustrated)</b> and plastic (locally <b>frustrated)</b> clusters of residues. The presented study has demonstrated that activation cancer mutations may affect the thermodynamic equilibrium between kinase states by allosterically altering the distribution of locally <b>frustrated</b> sites and increasing the local frustration in the inactive form, while eliminating locally <b>frustrated</b> sites and restoring structural rigidity of the active form. The energy landsape analysis of protein kinases and the proposed role of locally <b>frustrated</b> sites in activation mechanisms may have useful implications for bioinformatics-based screening and detection of functional site...|$|R

Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to <b>frustrate</b> {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to <b>frustrate</b> the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie.

5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century was a {{turbulent}} period; Britain was at war with France from 1793 to 1802. Hostilities between the two countries ceased with the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, but in 1803, the Napoleonic Wars began, and there were fears that France would invade England. In order to <b>frustrate</b> such an attack, the Royal Military Canal was proposed. This was initially a small canal near Hythe, but was extended during its planning phase to Cliff End, near Pett in East Sussex. The canal would join the River Rother at Iden and the river would become part of the defence system, as would the course of the River Brede from Rye to Winchelsea. Completion was scheduled for June 1805, but construction did not start until late 1804, and by the time it was completed in 1809, invasion was thought to be unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Back in Paris {{with two}} years of his grant remaining, Bizet was {{temporarily}} secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and <b>frustrate</b> new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.|$|E

The touring county considered Headley the key batsman, and targeted him by bowling defensively {{in an attempt to}} <b>frustrate</b> him. Headley lost his wicket through impatience in the first match, although he scored a pair of fifties, but scored a century in the third game. In total, he scored 266 runs at an average of 53.20, but Yorkshire won the series after winning the first game, Jamaica's first defeat at home in a first-class game for ten years. The matches were played in a very competitive atmosphere, but scoring was slow and Yorkshire played attritional cricket. During the series, Headley demanded expenses, which were not normally granted to the players. The Jamaican Board were reluctant to pay but Headley pointed out that, as a professional cricketer, he was entitled to the same treatment as the Yorkshire players, whose expenses were provided.

40|$|Abstract—We create two {{experimental}} {{situations to}} elicit two affective states: frustration, and delight. In the first experiment, {{participants were asked}} to recall situations while expressing either delight or frustration, while the second experiment tried to elicit these states naturally through a <b>frustrating</b> experience and through a delightful video. There were two significant differences {{in the nature of the}} acted vs. natural occurences of expressions. First, the acted instances were much easier for the computer to classify. Second, in 90 % of the acted cases, participants did not smile when <b>frustrated,</b> whereas in 90 % of the natural cases, participants smied during the <b>frustrating</b> interaction, despite self-reporting significant frustration with the experience. As a follow up study, we develop an automated system to distinguish between naturally occurring spontaneous smiles under <b>frustrating</b> and delightful stimuli by exploring their temporal patterns given video of both. We extracted local and global features related to human smile dynamics. Next, we evaluated and compared two variants of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Hidden-state Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) for binary classification. While human classification of the smile videos under <b>frustrating</b> stimuli was below chance, an accuracy of 92 % distinguishing smiles under <b>frustrating</b> and delighted stimuli was obtained using a dynamic SVM classifier.
