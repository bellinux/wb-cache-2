Overstock returns and returns due to discrepancies or defects in delivered items are all handled as part of a single process and may be listed in a single message. The message also allows a customer to notify a delivery shortage or an invoiced price or discount discrepancy, though this does not of course lead to a return – it simply alerts the supplier to take appropriate action. Like all EDIFACT transaction messages, RETANN has a header, a variable number of message lines (up to a maximum of 9, 999 in a single message), and a trailer.

The {{reason for this}} is that constraint (26 b) cannot always be fulfilled for R 2 [*]>[*] 0. In such a scenario, a cognitive radio system would switch to a different transmission strategy that can provide a non-zero secondary rate R 2. For example, it could switch to the underlay transmission mode presented here. In this way, the hybrid overlay-underlay strategy would never perform worse than the pure underlay strategy. However, including such a functionality in our experiments is against the nature of our work, which is to compare the underlay and overlay scenarios, and evaluate the effect of the learning phase. For this reason, we implement the strategies exactly as described <b>in</b> <b>Sections</b> 3.1 and 4.1.|$|R

40|$|The {{enclosed}} {{inspection report}} discusses {{a finding that}} appears to have greater than very low safety significance. As described <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> 1 <b>R</b> 21. b. 1 of the report, with respect to the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) water storage tank volume’s design analysis, your staff failed to select an appropriate method for calculating the minimum elevation (i. e., the analytical level) of water above the high pressure core spray (HPCS) pump suction line to preclude vortex formation and subsequent air entrainment in the pump’s suction. After further evaluation, we concluded that the analytical level would cause significant air entrainment and that HPCS would not be capable of completing its safety function. This finding was previously identified during the safety system design and performance capability inspection as an unresolved item (URI) 05000416 / 2005002 - 01 (DRS). In response to this issue, on December 1, 2005, your staff shifted the HPCS and RCIC inventory source to the suppression pool as allowed by your Technical Specifications. The inspectors concluded that vortexing from the suppression pool should not occur due to the depth of the HPCS and RCIC suction lines. We also understand that the RCIC water storage tank was modified on August 12, 2006, to recover RCIC and HPCS vortex margin. Thi...|$|R
