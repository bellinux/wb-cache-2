The CPFs are measured with four different cloud probes. Within similar ranges of detected particle sizes and concentrations, it is shown that different cloud probes yield results that are in good agreement with each other. The CPFs taken at Southern Hemisphere (SH) and Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes differ from each other. Above ice saturation, clouds occurred more frequently during the NH campaign. Local minima in the CPF as a function of RHI are interpreted as a systematic underestimation of cloud presence when cloud particles become invisible to cloud probes. Based on this interpretation, we find that clouds during the SH campaign formed preferentially at RHIs between 140 and 155 %, whereas clouds in the NH campaign formed at RHIs somewhat below 130 %. The data show that <b>interstitial</b> aerosol and <b>ice</b> particles coexist down to RHIs of 70 - 90 %, demonstrating that the ability to distinguish between different particle types in cirrus conditions depends on the sensors used to probe the aerosol/cirrus system.

Our aim was to describe the vegetation outlines of two active rock glaciers of the Ortles-Cevedale Massif (Central Italian Alps) on different substrates (silicate and carbonate) and compare them with the neighboring stable slopes and scree slopes. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) rock glaciers differ from the sur-rounding landforms {{for the presence of}} cold-adapted plant communities; 2) rock glacier plant communities indicate similar microclimatic conditions in spite of the contrasting lithology. Data were collected by phytosociological method performing 80 relevés of 25 m.

The cluster analysis separated first for all the two sites; afterwards, the landforms were differently discerned each other depending on the site.

The igneous rocks crop out along the upland-lowland front and in crater floors and other depressions that are low enough to intersect the sill's intrusion horizons. It is suggested that heat from the cooling sills melted some of the ice contained in overlying fragmental deposits, creating valley networks by subsurface flow of the meltwater. Terrains with undulatory, smooth surfaces and softened traces of valleys were created by more {{direct contact with the}} sills. Widespread subsidence following emplacement of the sills deformed both them and the nonvolcanic deposits that overlie them, accounting for the many structures that continue from ridged plains into the hilly uplands.

This interaction can produce mild explosions and the accumulation of scoria and spatter into small constructs. Pseudocraters in several localities in Iceland were examined {{in the field and}} compared to similar appearing features observed on Mars. The Icelandic pseudocrater cones in this study range in size from 6 to 70 m in diameter, have summit craters which range from 2 to 28 m in diameter (many cones lack craters entirely), and have flanks that am either concave- up or convex-up. The size and spacing of Icelandic pseudo-craters might be a function of the availability of water, in which larger, closely spaced features result from efficient lava-water interaction, as suggested by the environments in which the features formed. Possible Martian pseudocrater cones in Amamnis Planitia range in diameter from 30 to 180 m and have craters 12 to 80 m in diameter. A numerical model for volcanic explosions was adapted to study the formation of pseudocraters under terrestrial and Martian conditions. The results suggest that explosions forming Martian cones require significantly less water (calculated masses am less by a factor of 4 to 16) than those forming Icelandic pseudokers, despite their larger sizes, This is attributed to the low gravity and atmospheric pressure in the Mars environment and is consistent with the likely lower abundance of water, which might be present as <b>interstitial</b> <b>ice</b> at shallow depths in the regolith.

The North polar cap appears very similar in 2004 when compared to the situation in 1976 (Viking), with only a few regions exhibiting drastic changes in ice coverage. A comprehensive coverage has been obtained typically every week for the central regions (> 80 ° N), with resolutions improving from ~ 4 km in October to 2 km or less in late November and December. Large albedo variations are observed in the visible range, as already reported from Viking and MGS observations. The high repeat rate of OMEGA observations show that significant changes can occur in less than one week, and that regions may exhibit decreases in albedo while others get brighter, with ice variegation at scales of less than 10 km. The unique spectrometric capability of OMEGA has made it possible to simultaneously monitor the evolution of ice grain size and that of its dust content from the intensity of the ice absorption bands between 1 and 4 μm.

40|$|While {{planning}} the COAST Expedition to the Siberian Laptev Sea in 2005, {{the question of}} how to make a short equilibrium temperature measurement in a dry borehole arose. As a result, an infrared borehole tool was developed and used in three dry boreholes (up to 60. 2 m deep) in the coastal transition zone from terrestrial to sub-sea permafrost near Mamontovy Klyk in the western Laptev Sea. A depth versus temperature profile was acquired with equilibration times of 50 × 10 − 3 s at each depth interval. Comparison with a common resistor string revealed an offset due to limitations of accuracy of the infrared technique and the influence of the probe's massive steel housing. Therefore it was necessary to calibrate the infrared sensor with a high precision temperature logger in each borehole. The results of the temperature measurements show a highly dynamic transition zone with temperature gradients up to − 0. 092 °C/m and heat flow of − 218 mW/m. A period of submergence of only 600 years the drilled sub-sea permafrost is approaching the overlying seawater temperature at − 1. 61 °C with a temperature gradient of 0. 021 °C/m and heat flow of 49 mW/m. Further offshore, 11 km from the coastline, a temperature gradient of 0. 006 °C/m and heat flow of 14 mW/m occur.

The site is a small terminal moraine impounding roughly 300, 000 m 3 of water at ~ 3400 m a. s. l. Suspicious fine sediment in a small lake at the dam's downstream toe prompted initial concerns that anomalous seepage may be eroding matrix material from the moraine. 235 individual SP measurements covering {{the surface of the}} dam were collected in order to investigate electrokinetic current sources resulting from seepage, while resistivity soundings probed moraine stratigraphy and suggest that the till contains <b>interstitial</b> <b>ice.</b> Contoured SP data reveal a non-uniform voltage distribution over the moraine dam and two distinct negative SP anomalies. The first, located in the central area of the moraine, shows a broad negative SP zone around the crest and increasingly positive SP moving downhill towards both the upstream and downstream toes. This anomaly can be explained by shallow gravitational groundwater flow in the near subsurface combined with upward groundwater flux through evapotranspiration; numerical simulation of the combined effect matches field data well. The second SP anomaly has a tightly localized distribution and can be explained by vertically descending flow into a bedrock fault conduit. Our conceptual seepage model suggests that flow travels from Dana Lake first at the boundary of ice-filled moraine and bedrock before converging on a concentrated channel in the subvertical fault zone. Positive SP near the dam abutments results from groundwater inflow from adjacent hillslopes. Combined analyses suggest that seepage erosion is not currently affecting the moraine dam, and that the sediment observed on the bed of the downstream toe lake is likely a remnant of past outflow events...|$|E

The formation {{and distribution of}} rock glaciers is restricted to climates conducive to permafrost development and lithology vulnerable to weathering for source rock. Subsurface ice is insulated from solar radiation, allowing rock glacier formation in lower latitudes and elevations than ice glaciers. Thus rock glaciers provide a useful geomorphic indicator {{of past and present}} climate change in regions absent of ice glaciers such as the U. S. Southwest. This study inventories 424 rock glaciers covering 18. 36 km 2 in the state of New Mexico, identifies environmental parameters that control their formation, and estimates dates for periods of periglacial activity. New Mexico rock glaciers exist in a broad latitudinal range between 33 °N in southern New Mexico to 37 °N at the Colorado border. The distribution of rock glaciers is controlled predominantly by elevation, mean annual air temperature (MAAT), slope, and geology; precipitation and solar irradiance are also minor controls. Tertiary intrusive bedrock was found to create extremely dense distributions of rock glaciers. High elevation rock glaciers with extremely cold MAATs {{are more likely to be}} located outside areas shaded from solar irradiance, and may require increased ice temperature for internal deformation. A bimodal histogram of minimum elevation and MAAT suggests at least two pulses of periglacial activity. Rock glaciers that likely formed during the late to terminal Wisconsin (35 – 12 kya) reach minimum elevations of ~ 2, 400 m, whereas those formed during the Neoglacial (4. 9 kya – 0. 12 kya) flow to ~ 3, 450 m.

The study of basal ice properties provides {{a rare opportunity to}} improve our understanding of subglacial environments and processes and to refine ice sheet behaviour modelling. Here, we present and discuss the results of water stable isotopes (δ 18 O and δ D), ice fabrics, debris weight/size distribution and gas content of the basal part of the NEEM (North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling Project) ice core. Below a depth of 2533. 85 m, almost 10 m of basal debris-rich material was retrieved from the borehole, and regular occurrence of frozen sediments with only <b>interstitial</b> <b>ice</b> lenses in the bottom 5 m suggest that the ice–bedrock interface was reached. The sequence is composed of an alternation of three visually contrasting types of ice: clear ice with specks (very small amounts) of particulate inclusions, stratified debris-rich layers and ice containing dispersed debris. The use of water stable isotope signatures (δ 18 O and δ D), together with other parameters, allows discrimination between the different types of ice and to unravel the processes involved in their formation and transformation. The basal debris-rich material presents δ 18 O values [− 39. 9 ‰; − 34. 4 ‰] within the range of the above last 300 m of unaltered meteoric ice [− 44. 9 ‰; − 30. 6 ‰] spanning a glacial-interglacial range of values. This rules out the hypothesis of a basal ice layer originating from pre-ice sheet ice overridden by the growing ice sheet, as previously suggested e. g. in the case of GRIP (Greenland Ice Core Project). We show that clear basal ice with specks corresponds to altered meteoric glacial ice where some of the climatic signal could have been preserved. However, the stratified debris-rich layers and the ice containing dispersed debris layers respectively express an “open” or “closed” system melting/refreezing signature, somewhat blurred by mixing processes in {{the upper part of the}} sequence. Climatic reconstruction is therefore prohibited from these ice types. We propose a first interpretative framework for the build-up of the NEEM basal ice sequence, based on the origin of the various ice types...|$|E
40|$|Scalloped {{depressions}} are {{a unique}} martian surface morphology {{found in the}} northern and southern hemisphere latitude-dependent dust and ice-rich surface mantles. These features exhibit a distinct asymmetric northÃ¢Â�Â�south slope profile, characterized by steep pole-facing scarps, flat floors and gentle equatorfacing slopes. We examined High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images of the southern hemisphere to determine their longitudinal distribution, which revealed that a majority of scalloped terrain is located in the region of the southern wall of the Hellas Basin and northern Malea Planum. A detailed map of this area was produced where scallops were found to contour the southern wall of the basin, and where the ice-rich mantle was seen to be thickest. Scalloped terrain is concentrated along the topographic highs near the Amphitrites and Peneus Paterae and areal extent and depth decreases with increasing depth into the basin. We also examined existing hypothesis for the formation and evolution of scalloped depressions using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images and data from the Thermal Emission Imaging SystemÃ¢Â�Â�Infrared (THEMISÃ¢Â�Â�IR) and the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). Our approach provides regional context for the development of scalloped terrains within the southern hemisphere, and offers detailed evidence of scallop depressions forming around small cracks, presumably caused by thermal contraction. Morphometric measurements show that scalloped depressions can be as much as 40 m deep, with typical depths of between 10 and 20 m. Our observations of scallop formation and development in the southern hemisphere support a solar-insolation model proposed by previous researchers (e. g. [Morgenstern, A., Hauber, E., Reiss, D., van Gasselt, S., Grosse, G., Schirrmeister, L., 2007. J. Geophys. Res. 112, CiteID E 06010; Lefort, A., Russell, P. S., Thomas, N., McEwen, A. S., Dundas, C. M., Kirk, R. L., 2009 a. J. Geophys. Res. 114, E 04005; Lefort, A., Russell, P. S., Thomas, N., 2009 b. Icarus, in press]). Observations made using HiRISE images suggest that scalloped depressions most likely form from small cracks in the mantle, which become larger and deeper through sublimation of <b>interstitial</b> <b>ice</b> from within the mantle. Sublimation is likely enhanced on equator-facing slopes because of increased solar insolation, which accounts for the asymmetric slope profile and hemispherical orientation and is demonstrated by THEMISIR images. We suggest that sublimation lag deposits can possibly be removed by dust devils or strong slope winds related to the Hellas Basin, offering an explanation as to why scalloped terrain is so abundant only in this area of the southern hemisphere. Daytime maximum summer temperatures suggest that sublimation in the study area of Malea Planum is possible under current conditions if the sublimation lag is removed. While it cannot be ruled out that scalloped terrain in Malea Planum is presently evolving, we attribute the extensive distribution to geologically recent obliquity excursions when conditions were more conducive to mesoscale modification of the ice-rich mantle...|$|E
40|$|Herb- or shrub-chronology, a {{technique}} adapted from dendrochronology, {{is the study}} of the annual growth rings in roots of certain perennial dicotyledonous plants. The presence of annual growth increments in high-elevation plants is significant as it highlights the applicability of herbchronology for climatic, ecological and geomorphologic applications in alpine and other extra-arboreal regions. For alpine sites along the eastern crest of the Sierra Nevada range I present the first shrub-ring chronologies of the species Linanthus pungens (Torr.) J. M. Porter & L. A. Johnson. L. pungens individuals were collected at, and are especially ubiquitous at rock glacier sites in north-east trending glacial-cirque valleys. Rock glaciers are an increasingly recognized and studied feature on the alpine landscape, supporting floristically diverse plant populations, distinct thermal regimes decoupled from the external air and perennial water sources fed by <b>interstitial</b> <b>ice.</b> These landforms are expected to be refugia for alpine flora and fauna in some regions for projected warmer and drier climates. To evaluate plant growth on rock glaciers as compared to adjacent talus slopes in the central Sierra Nevada range of California, USA, a series of five cirque basins were selected as sites for paired rock glacier- talus slope vegetation comparisons. Vegetation cover, species richness, diversity measures and plant functional traits were recorded at ten sites (five rock glaciers, five talus slopes) along a 100 -kilometer latitudinal span of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada range. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to evaluate general patterns in cover, diversity and functional traits for the 10 sites and inform subsequent statistical analyses. Both vegetation cover and species richness were significantly greater on rock glacier sites than on adjacent talus slopes even though mean slope values for the rock glacier sites were higher. Significantly, for the present study, rock glaciers support a higher number of the species Linanthus pungens, a climatically sensitive, long-lived alpine sub-shrub, showing that these periglacial landforms are not only floristically distinct but are also habitats containing natural climate archives useful to the field of herbchronology. L. pungens shrub-ring chronologies are determined to be distinct from Pinus albicaulis chronologies growing at the same five sets of sites in the Sierra Nevada study location. P. albicaulis (PIAL) tree-ring chronologies and L. pungens (LIPU) shrub-ring chronologies were constructed for four cirque basin sites. Comparisons were made between chronologies based on growth form (shrub or tree) and site, and on chronology response to average monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and April 1 snowpack values. Chronologies are significantly more similar to other chronologies of the same growth form (PIAL-PIAL or LIPU-LIPU) than are same-site chronologies of different growth form (i. e. PIAL-LIPU chronologies) (p 0. 85) to capture a robust common signal from 1952 through 2007). Marker years in the BL chronology correspond to drought (wide rings) and persistent snowpack (narrow rings). Response function analysis indicates significant correlations with July minimum temperatures and the previous year's November precipitation. Increase in the radial growth of the taproot of L. pungens at BL has not decreased over the past century and is more highly correlated to temperature (positively) and snowpack and precipitation (negatively) during {{the latter half of the}} chronology period. Predictions of decreasing snowpack and warming temperatures for the alpine Sierra Nevada could indicate increased shrub growth over the next century and possible shrub range expansion if unprecedented drought does not prove to limit growth in the future. Work at BL and the other four alpine L. pungens chronology locations demonstrate a potential for additional research on climate-shrub growth interactions and in particular for investigations into climate controls on upper shrubline growth and movement in the Sierra Nevada range in California...|$|E
