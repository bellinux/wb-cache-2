50|$|On 22 August 2013, the Bank of Mauritius issued new 25-, 50-, and 500-rupee polymer {{banknotes}} {{which will}} circulate {{in parallel with}} the existing paper notes of the same denominations. The new polymer notes have almost the same design as the preceding paper banknotes, but contain numerous new security features such as transparent windows showing {{the image of the}} dodo, numbers printed with magnetic ink which become fluorescent under ultra violet light, and swing features printed in <b>iridescent</b> <b>ink,</b> which change to a different colour when observed in transparency or when tilted. The 25-, and 50-rupee notes are printed by Oberthur Technologies on Innovia Security's Guardian substrate and the 500-rupee note is printed by De La Rue on its Safeguard (formerly Flexycoin) substrate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most halftoning {{techniques}} allow screen dots to overlap. They rely on {{the assumption}} that the inks are transparent, i. e. the inks do not scatter a significant portion of the light back to the air. However, many special effect inks such as metallic <b>inks,</b> <b>iridescent</b> <b>inks</b> or pigmented inks are not transparent. In order to create halftone images, halftone dots formed by such inks should be juxtaposed, i. e. printed side by side. We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping. The method uses a monochrome library of screen elements made of discrete lines having rational thicknesses. Discrete line juxtaposed color halftoning is performed efficiently by multiple accesses to the screen element library. Index Terms—Color halftoning, discrete lines, juxtapose...|$|R
