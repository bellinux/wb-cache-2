50|$|An RLC circuit (or LCR circuit) is an {{electrical}} circuit {{consisting of a}} resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for resistance, inductance and capacitance respectively. The circuit forms a harmonic oscillator for current and resonates similarly to an LC circuit. The main difference stemming from {{the presence of the}} resistor is that any oscillation induced in the circuit decays over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called damping. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency of <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation,</b> although the resonant frequency for driven oscillations remains the same as an LC circuit. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a separate component. A pure LC circuit is an ideal that exists only in theory.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} description ignores DC, {{which can}} be added easily afterwards.The above-mentioned C and L are in effect a parallel LC circuit to ground. When the transistor is on, it pushes through the serial LC circuit into the load and some current begins to flow to the parallel LC circuit to ground. Then the serial LC circuit swings back and compensates the current into the parallel LC circuit. At this point the current through the transistor is zero and it is switched off. Both LC circuits are now filled with energy in C and L0. The whole circuit performs a <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation.</b> The damping by the load has been adjusted so that some time later the energy from the Ls is gone into the load, but the energy in both C0 peaks at the original value to in turn restore the original voltage so that the voltage across the transistor is zero again {{and it can be}} switched on.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} {{the discipline of}} handling qualities, the concept of stability should be understood. Stability can be defined only when the vehicle is in trim; that is, there are no unbalanced forces or moments acting on the vehicle to cause it to deviate from steady flight. If this condition exists, and if the vehicle is disturbed, stability refers to the tendency of the vehicle {{to return to the}} trimmed condition. If the vehicle initially tends to return to a trimmed condition, it is said to be statically stable. If it continues to approach the trimmed condition without overshooting, the motion is called a subsidence. If the motion causes the vehicle to overshoot the trimmed condition, it may oscillate back and forth. If this oscillation damps out, the motion is called a <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation</b> and the vehicle is said to be dynamically stable. On the other hand, if the motion increases in amplitude, the vehicle is said to be dynamically unstable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{function}} of the spark gap is to initially present a high resistance to the circuit so that the C1 capacitor is allowed to charge. When the breakdown voltage of the gap is reached, {{the air in the}} gap ionizes, the resistance across the gap is dramatically lower and a current pulse flows across the arc {{to the rest of the}} circuit. The gap is set so that the discharge coincides with a maximum or near maximum of charge in C1 and it is as if a high speed switch is turned on at just the right moment to allow the C1 capacitor to discharge its stored energy into the other circuit elements. This pulse of energy is rapidly exchanged back and forth between the C2 and L elements and takes the form of a <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation</b> at a radio frequency. The back and forth exchange of energy is in the form of an alternating current and voltage wave with much of the energy flowing out to the antenna.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of water oxidation {{is still not}} fully elucidated, but we know many details about this process. The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen requires extraction of four electrons and four protons from two molecules of water. The experimental evidence that oxygen is released through cyclic reaction of oxygen evolving complex (OEC) within one PSII was provided by Pierre Joliot et al. They have shown that, if dark-adapted photosynthetic material (higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria) is exposed {{to a series of}} single turnover flashes, oxygen evolution is detected with typical period-four <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation</b> with maxima on the third and the seventh flash and with minima on the first and the fifth flash (for review, see). Based on this experiment, Bessel Kok and co-workers [...] introduced a cycle of five flash-induced transitions of the so-called S-states, describing the four redox states of OEC: When four oxidizing equivalents have been stored (at the S4-state), OEC returns to its basic S0-state. In the absence of light, the OEC will [...] "relax" [...] to the S1 state; the S1 state is often described as being [...] "dark-stable". The S1 state is largely considered to consist of manganese ions with oxidation states of Mn3+, Mn3+, Mn4+, Mn4+. Finally, the intermediate S-states were proposed by Jablonsky and Lazar as a regulatory mechanism and link between S-states and tyrosine Z.|$|E
5000|$|The zero {{crossing}} steps of Fig. 1b allow a single bias current {{passing through the}} entire junction array while insuring that every junction in the array is on a constant voltage step. This leads to significant complication in setting the array to a particular desired step. Figure 9a illustrates a simplified diagram of the bias circuit. In this circuit a computer sets the bias voltage [...] with one digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and uses a second DAC to control the bias impedance [...] via optically modulated resistors. Figure 9b shows a graphical solution for the stable operating points of the array and illustrates how control of both the bias voltage and the bias impedance is used to select a particular quantum voltage step.The load line plots the range of voltage and current that are defined by the bias supply. The intersections of this load line with the I-V curve of the array (vertical lines) are possible stable bias points. Changes to [...] shift the load line left and right, whereas changes to [...] change its slope. To select a step at a given voltage , the source voltage is set to [...] and the source impedance is set to about , where [...] is the step height. This makes the load line steep enough to intersect {{only one or two}} steps and forces the array to a step at or very near [...] Applying a <b>damped</b> <b>oscillation</b> to [...] helps move the array to the step closest to [...] After a step is selected, the source impedance is smoothly increased on all four bias connections (load line becomes horizontal) until the array current goes to zero and the array is effectively disconnected from the bias source. This open-bias condition is the most stable state for the array and eliminates the possibility of any errors resulting from a small series resistance in the array - a common array defect. Computer control of this three-step process enables the system to find and stabilize the array voltage on a particular step within a few seconds. High quality Josephson arrays will remain on a selected step for many hours.|$|E
