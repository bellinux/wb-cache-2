This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} regarded by the Privy Council as criminal, and possibly treasonous, {{to disclose the}} oath administered to Privy Counsellors as they take office.

5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark on a course for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E

The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> democracy.|$|E

Another 215,000people, including 2,000children cut off from their parents, were allowed to leave East Germany to rejoin their families.

5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} the federal <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> civil suit filed by Lambdin P.

The civil case was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana at Indianapolis, where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's favor and he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, {{forestry}} {{companies were}} selling units to NZ and international buyers.

Industry sources estimated the prices were approximately $NZ21 to $NZ22 a tonne and that value of the trade would have been between $NZ10.9 million and $NZ11.4 million, depending on the exchange rate. Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of secret talks and negotiations {{that led to}} the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{took place}} from March to June 1937 in the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta.

The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as he had promised before his 1935election.

5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of phases, {{to fund the}} construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% {{of the land of}} Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{contributed to}} {{the deterioration of the}} Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coup d'état. After the uprising, the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E
5|$|There was {{pressure}} on the mounted police to assist local <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of ways, often opposed by the police themselves.

5|$|This revised {{proposal}} was continued in a further white paper in March 1970, although this {{proposed that the}} counties be unitary authorities which would have no district councils below them. The incoming Conservative government resurrected two-tier local <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consultative document published in February 1971, again with the same upper-tier boundaries. Some minor changes having been made to the existing county boundaries due to special local factors, the Local Government Act 1972 duly created Clwyd as a merger of Flintshire with most of Denbighshire, along with the Edeyrnion Rural District from Merionethshire. The 1970 white paper had introduced the name of Clwyd by reference to the River Clwyd and the Clwydian range of hills; Clwyd was the only new Welsh county which did not take its name from an ancient kingdom.|$|E
5|$|While {{these events}} progressed Queen Mary {{had been raised}} as a Catholic in France, and married to the Dauphin, who became king as Francis II in 1559, making her queen consort of France. When Francis died in 1560, Mary, now 19, elected to return to Scotland {{to take up the}} <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile environment. Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year {{personal}} reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, David Riccio, was followed by that of her unpopular second husband Lord Darnley, father of her infant son, and her abduction by and marriage to the Earl of Bothwell, who was implicated in Darnley's murder.|$|E
5|$|Choe Bu of the Tamjin Choe clan {{was born}} in 1454 in the prefectural town of Naju in Jeollanam-do, Korea. Choe passed the jinsa {{examinations}} in 1477, which was a lower examination that did not immediately ensure a post in government; rather, it permitted enrollment in the National Academy, or Seonggyungwan, where he could study further for the higher mungwa examinations. In preparation for the exams, he studied the Five Classics as Confucian students had for centuries, but he also was taught the emphasis of the Four Books of Zhu Xi (1130–1200), which was {{in line with the}} Neo-Confucian doctrine first accepted in mainstream Chinese education during the mid-13th century. He passed his first civil service examination in 1482 and a second civil service examination in 1486, qualifying him for an immediate post in <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> career as a graduate scholar-official that spanned 18 years, Choe was privileged with various positions. He held posts in the Hodang Library, printing office, and the National Academy. He also held posts involving the military, such as on the military supplies commission, with the office of the inspector-general, and with the Yongyang garrison. The culmination of his career was his promotion as a minister of the Directorate of Ceremonies in the capital, a distinguished office. Choe Bu {{was also one of the}} scholars who aided in the compilation of the Dongguk Tonggam in 1485, a history of Korea from ancient times. Choe was learned in Confucian ethics, Chinese letters, Chinese poetry, and well versed in Korean history, geography, and famous people; all this later helped him to dispel the notion of Chinese that he was a Japanese pirate instead of a Korean official who had unfortunately shipwrecked in China. In 1487, Choe Bu was sent to Jeju Island to check the registers for escaped slaves from the mainland.|$|E
