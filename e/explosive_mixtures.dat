25|$|Waste {{deposition}} in landfills, which generate methane. Methane is highly flammable and may form <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with air. Methane {{is also an}} asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of limited quantities of air and moisture, such as in a poorly closed container, <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> of peroxides may form. This {{is accompanied by a}} yellowing or browning of the solid. As such, sodium amide is to be stored in a tightly closed container, under an atmosphere of an inert gas. Sodium amide samples which are yellow or brown in color represent explosion risks.|$|E
25|$|The {{alkali metals}} and alkali earth metals all react spontaneously with oxygen {{when exposed to}} dry air to form oxides, and form {{hydroxides}} {{in the presence of}} oxygen and water. As a result, none of these elements is found in nature as a free metal. Caesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a getter in vacuum tubes. Although solid magnesium reacts slowly with oxygen at STP, it is capable of burning in air, generating very high temperatures, and its metal powder may form <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with air.|$|E

25|$|At room temperature, ethane is a {{flammable}} gas. When {{mixed with}} air at 3.0%–12.5% by volume, it forms an <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with devastating consequences.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous ammonia is {{classified}} as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (autoignition temperature: 651nbsp&°C) and can form <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with air (16–25%). The permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50nbsp&ppm (35nbsp&mg/m3), while the IDLH concentration is estimated at 300nbsp&ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to {{the smell of the}} gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50nbsp&ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100nbsp&ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper- and zinc-containing alloys, and so brass fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, {{either in}} pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> upon contact with organic compounds. Highly {{concentrated}} hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable {{and can cause}} a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid. Distillation of hydrogen peroxide at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. It is also corrosive, especially when concentrated, but even domestic-strength solutions can cause irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Swallowing hydrogen peroxide solutions is particularly dangerous, as decomposition in the stomach releases large quantities of gas (10 times the volume of a 3% solution), leading to internal bloating. Inhaling over 10% can cause severe pulmonary irritation.|$|E

25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E
500|$|Hydrogen gas forms <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{with air}} in {{concentrations}} from 4–74% and with chlorine at 5–95%. The explosive reactions may {{be triggered by}} spark, heat, or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is [...] Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, {{as illustrated by the}} faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.|$|E
2500|$|Diborane is the {{chemical}} compound consisting of boron and hydrogen with the formula B2H6. It is a colorless, highly unstable and pyrophoric gas {{at room temperature}} with a repulsively sweet odor. [...] Diborane mixes well with air, easily forming <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Diborane will ignite spontaneously in moist air at room temperature. Synonyms include boroethane, boron hydride, and diboron hexahydride.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{spontaneous}} combustion of coal in the goaf area, gases may {{be allowed to}} build up behind seals so as to exclude oxygen from the sealed goaf area. Where a goaf may contain an <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture</b> of methane and oxygen, nitrogen injection/inertisation {{may be used to}} exclude oxygen or push the <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture</b> deep into the goaf where there are no probable ignition sources. Seals are required to be monitored each shift by a certified mine supervisor for damage and leaks of harmful gases.|$|R

50|$|In the {{presence}} of firedamp the <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture</b> is drawn through two gauzes (cylinder and shelf), burnt and then within the chimney are only burnt gases, not <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture.</b> Like a Clanny, and the Davy before it, it acts {{as an indicator of}} firedamp, burning more brightly in its presence. Later models had graduated shields by which the deputy could determine the concentration of firedamp from the heightening of the flame. Whilst the Clanny will continue to burn if laid on its side, potentially cracking the glass; the Mueseler will extinguish itself due to the stoppage of convection currents. The lamp is safe in currents up to 15 feet per second.|$|R
2500|$|RDX {{was widely}} used during World War II, often in <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with TNT such as Torpex, Composition B, Cyclotols, and H6.

RDX {{is believed to have been}} used in many bomb plots including terrorist plots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reaction}} is exothermic {{but has a}} high activation energy in the gas phase (~62 kcal/mol). The condensed phases (solid or liquid) show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal/mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities. [...] Because of the production of carbon, TNT explosions have a sooty appearance. [...] Because TNT has an excess of carbon, <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> with oxygen-rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than TNT alone. [...] During the 20th century, amatol, a mixture of TNT with ammonium nitrate was a widely used military explosive.|$|E
