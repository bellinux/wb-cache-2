5|$|Although 0 is <b>divisible</b> by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not {{straightforward}} to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is <b>divisible</b> by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|Animals without blood {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, lobsters, and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and <b>divisible</b> animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other animals without blood included fish lice, hermit crabs, red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|E
5|$|There are two notable optical double {{stars in}} Hydrus. Pi Hydri, {{composed}} of Pi1 Hydri and Pi2 Hydri, is <b>divisible</b> in binoculars. Around 476 light-years distant, Pi1 {{is a red}} giant of spectral type M1III that varies between magnitudes 5.52 and 5.58. Pi2 is an orange giant of spectral type K2III and shining with a magnitude of 5.7, around 488 light-years from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely <b>divisible.</b> He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Crystals of widgiemoolthalite {{conform to}} a monoclinic system of symmetry, occupying space group P21/c. A unit cell of the mineral, the {{smallest}} <b>divisible</b> unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, {{is composed of}} two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.06, b = 8.75, and c = 8.32Å. Each unit cell of widgiemoolthalite has a β value of 114.3° and a volume of 667.48Å3.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is <b>divisible</b> by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|Thomson {{suggested}} that atoms were <b>divisible,</b> {{and that the}} corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not <b>divisible</b> and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E
5|$|Crystals of {{vanadinite}} {{conform to}} a hexagonal system of symmetry. This internal structure is often {{reflected in the}} hexagonal external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually {{in the form of}} short hexagonal prisms, but can also be found as hexagonal pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A unit cell of vanadinite, the smallest <b>divisible</b> unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, {{is in the form of}} a hexagonal prism. The unit cell of vanadinite is composed of two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.331Å and c = 7.343Å), where a is the length of each side of the hexagon and c is the height of the prism. The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = a2c sin(60°), is 678.72Å3.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus. The college was established at a site located near Lake Erie in Huron, Ohio when the first building (now Foundation Hall) was opened. In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat <b>divisible</b> public meeting area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle more students, more college/community partnerships; and expand the James H. McBride Arboretum to the entire campus.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is <b>divisible</b> by any other common divisor c.|$|E
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is <b>divisible</b> into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence {{are assumed to be}} unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system <b>divisible</b> by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars. ADS 9731 is an even rarer multiple system in the constellation, composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sections}} of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants, {{although they did}} not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas {{they were no longer}} <b>divisible</b> between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions. Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility; they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles.|$|E
5|$|The Steynings {{family owned}} Holnicote until the direct male line became extinct {{with the death}} of Charles Staynings (1622–1700). His wife, Susanna (died 1685), was a {{daughter}} of Sir Nicholas Martyn of Oxton and Steynings's heir was their nephew, William Martyn. According to records of the Heralds' Visitations of Devon and research by the Victorian historian J. L. Vivian, this William Martyn lived in Oxton in the parish of Kenton, Devon; he was Susanna Martyn's great-nephew and died in 1710, aged 30. He sold the estate to William Blackford, a Master in Chancery. Blackford then bought the manors of Bossington and Avill, the latter from Anthony Stocker and his wife, Sarah; this estate extended from the ridge of Grabbist nearly to the sea-shore and also included land in the parishes of Dunster, Carhampton, Crowcombe, Stogumber, Timberscombe and St. Decumans. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of John Dyke of Pixton, and died in 1728. His son, William, succeeded him and married Henrietta Collet (died 1727), a daughter and co-heiress of Joseph Collet of Hertford Castle in Hertfordshire. However, he died only three years after his father. Their only daughter and heiress, Henrietta Blackford, inherited the estate as an infant, but died aged 7 in 1733. The estates were <b>divisible</b> upon a great-aunt, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737), and a second cousin, Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Dyke of Tetton and Mary, a daughter of Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737). Later in 1733, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737) conveyed her share in the estate to her only surviving son, Edward Dyke (died 1746) who in turn conveyed his portion to his niece in 1744, making her the sole owner of the entire estate.|$|E
5|$|The Western Han capital at Chang'an {{was divided}} into one hundred and sixty walled {{residential}} wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, {{it is possible that}} seven of them were actually <b>divisible</b> parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in the marketplace. In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into the marketplace daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients. Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.|$|E
