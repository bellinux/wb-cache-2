The Trek has now morphed into a luxurious motorhome with the only thing remaining from its early inception is the Electro-Majic Bed concept now called [...] "HappiJac" [...] and the Dame murals. Even the exterior aluminum skin which the early Treks were famous for has now been replaced with a <b>gel-coat</b> fiberglass exterior. The original Trek had the appeal of a lower price point for customers wishing to purchase a Class A recreational vehicle of a high quality build. But by 2008 much of that appeal was gone and the Trek was competing with other manufactures who had entered this affordable small Class A market and the growth of the Class B market segment as well. Only 35 production models were made of the 2008 Safari Trek and just two floor plans are show in brochures.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} electrically-heated ceramic composite tooling, aimed primarily at the manufacture of large composites structures, for aerospace or for wind energy. The tooling is designed to operate at temperatures up to 300 Â°C, but {{has the potential to}} be used at temperatures up to 500 Â°C and above. The ceramic material is an aluminosilicate material, reinforced by continuous fibres and thermoplastic polymer, and laid up with embedded electrical heaters. The ceramic and reinforcing layers are laid up by hand at room temperature, on a standard pattern and cured initially to 60 Â°C, followed by a free-standing post-cure, in stages to approximately 400 Â°C. Special-purpose <b>gel-coats</b> and surface sealing layers are employed to ensure a smooth, vacuum-tight surface. The tooling is lightweight, strong and durable, and has a low coefficient of thermal expansion. Electrical heating power per square metre of tool surface is typically between 5. 0 and 15. 0 KW/sq. m. Examples are given of the use of the tooling to manufacture 12. 6 metre long glass-fibre/epoxy and glass-fibre/PBT wind turbine blades (250 KW machine). Aerospace carbon-fibre epoxy prepregs are also processed on the tooling successfully. In all cases, the materials need to be processed between 180 Â°C and slightly above 200 Â°C. The integrally-heated ceramic composite tooling provides a more cost-effective tooling system for processing thermoplastic or thermoset composites at these temperatures than standard metal tooling...|$|R
50|$|The Manta Mirage was a {{mid-engined}} vehicle produced by Manta Cars, owned by brothers Brad and Tim LoVette, in Costa Mesa, California* from 1974 to 1986. The Mirage, originally {{referred to as}} just the 'Manta', or the 'Manta Can-Am', was a light-weight road-legal car, based loosely on the McLaren M8 Can-Am racing car. The Mirage's steel space frame chassis was fitted with a high-output V8 engine and 4-speed transaxle. Most Mirages were equipped with 327 cu. in. (5.4 L) or 350 cu. in. (5.7 L) Chevrolet small block V8 engines, though some used 454 cu. in. (7.4 L) or 460 cu. in. (7.5 L) V8 engines. The original Mirage design mated the Chevy V8 to a Corvair transaxle via a Kelmark adapter and remote shifter. The bodywork was all hand-laid fiberglass, pre-colored {{in a range of}} <b>gel-coat</b> colors. Gull-wing doors were fitted to a removable top section, while the doors flip forward for entry. With curb weights as light as 1,900 lbs (680 kg), the cars could be built by the factory or their owners to be extremely fast.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{materials}} such as glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRPs) possess the advantages of high strength and stiffness, as well as low density and highly flexible tailoring; therefore, their potential in replacing conventional materials (such as concrete, aluminium and steel) in building façade has become attractive. This paper addresses {{one of the major}} issues that hinder the extensive use of composite structures in the high-rise building industry, which is the fire resistance. In this study, a fire performance enhancement strategy for multilayer composite sandwich panels, which are comprised of GFRP composite facets and polyethylene foam core, is proposed with the addition of environmentally friendly, fire retardant unsaturated polyester resins and <b>gel-coats.</b> A series of burning experimental studies including thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and single burning item (SBI) are carried out on the full scale composite sandwich as well as on single constituents, providing information regarding heat release rate, total heat release, fire growth rate, and smoke production. Experimental results are compared with fire safety codes for building materials to identify the key areas for improvements. A fire dynamic numerical model has been developed in this work using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to simulate the burning process of composite structures in the SBI test. Numerical results of heat production and growth rate are presented in comparison with experimental observations validating the computational model and provide further insights into the fire resisting process. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effect of fire retardant additives on the fire performance of the composite sandwich panel leading to optimum designs for the sandwich panel...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the recent}} {{increase}} {{in the use of}} fiber reinforced polymers in the civil engineering industry in general and in the bridge engineering industry in particular, as well as the recently more and more applied cylindrical truss bridge type, this research focuses on the question whether it is possible to combine fiber reinforced polymers as stand-alone structural material and this bridge type to construct a bridge suitable for heavy traffic as well as bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This research combines an extensive literature study on the use of fiber reinforced polymers for bridge engineering with a theoretical feasibility- and design-study on fiber reinforced polymer cylindrical truss bridges for heavy traffic. During the design study the spatial needs of all bridge users were defined to obtain an initial shape of the bridge. This shape was then optimized in several steps using finite-element-modeling and -analysis, yielding a final shape of the bridge. The behavior of this structure under design loads was then extensively investigated, again using finite element analysis, showing that the bridge could very well meet the self-derived deflection limit for fiber reinforced polymers at relatively low stress levels. Since fiber reinforced materials are a very diverse field of material, with hundreds of different compositions being available, the first result of this study was the choice of a suitable composite for further analysis. For this bridge design very high fiber content (> 60 %) carbon/epoxy composite was used. The main reason for this choice was the high modulus and -strength of the carbon fibers and the high durability and strength of the epoxy resin. A major reason of the slow implementation of fiber reinforced polymers in the bridge engineering industry are the worries concerning the lack of fire safety of the material. The literature study of this research showed however {{that it is possible to}} construct a heavy traffic full-FRP truss bridge, while complying with the known fire safety standards. The virgin FRP material can be adapted by several fire-protection measures; it turned out that a combination of intumescent <b>gel-coating</b> and low volume phosphorous filler systems works best in increasing the fire resistance and thereby providing a fire resistance class of R 30 for hydrocarbon fire curve loading. The initial shape of the bridge was optimized in three stages: first several different truss topologies, which were derived with a parametric geometric model, were analyzed and compared using finite element analysis software, yielding the square truss with one diagonal as most efficient topology. In the next steps several grid sizes of this truss as well as several cross section dimensions were compared, again using finite element analysis software. An optimum was found between minimum material usage and minimum deflection, which reduced the material usage of the main load bearing elliptical truss by about 40 % compared to the initial variant. The optimized structure was then fitted with the inner bridge deck supporting trusses as well as the cantilever trusses. The elliptical truss bridge performed very well considering the maximum deflections and stresses under Eurocode design loads and load combinations that were derived in finite element modeling software. When comparing the full-FRP bridge design with similar, existing steel structures, the maximum deformations and –stresses were considerably lower for the full-FRP bridge while only weighing about 60 % of the steel structure. This research showed that the ‘new’ cylindrical truss bridge type is not only an aesthetically appealing structure but also performs structurally very well when combined with fiber reinforced polymer as structural material. It turned out that fiber reinforced polymers can be used as stand-alone structural material for medium span heavy traffic bridges. Next to that, this research clarified that there is no legitimate structural reason for the fact that fiber reinforced polymers are used relatively scarcely in the civil engineering- and bridge engineering industry compared to traditional building materials such as steel and concrete. Since this research is one of the first researches of its kind, using FRP as stand-alone structural material for a relatively new and complex bridge type, more research is needed in the field of high order connections for fiber reinforced polymer circular hollow sections. Next to that the possibility of the use of differently sized and shaped cross sections for the truss members should be investigated.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of advanced composites {{are essential for}} their structural performance, but the surface finish on exterior composite panels is of critical importance for customer satisfaction. This paper describes the application of wavelet texture analysis (WTA) {{to the task of}} automatically classifying the surface finish properties of two fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite construction types (clear resin and <b>gel-coat)</b> into three quality grades. Samples were imaged and wavelet multi-scale decomposition was used to create a visual texture representation of the sample, capturing image features at different scales and orientations. Principal components analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the texture feature vector, permitting successful classification of the samples using only the first principal component. This work extends and further validates the feasibility of this approach as the basis for automated non-contact classification of composite surface finish using image analysis. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. - On {{the skin}} surface of delphinids small biofoulers are {{challenged}} to high shear water flow and liquid-vapor interfaces of air-bubbles during jumping. This state of self-cleaning {{is supported by}} the even, nano-rough gel-coated epidermal surface of the skin. In the present study we focussed on the topographic evolution of gel formation and the chemical composition of the gel smoothing the skin surface of the pilot whale, Globicephala melas. We employed photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with cryo-scanning electron microscopy (CSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the superficial layer of the epidermis, stratum corneum, intercellular material was shown by electron optical methods to assemble from smaller into larger covalently cross-linked aggregates during the transit of the corneocytes towards the skin surface. Employing XPS measurements, the surface of the skin and the intercellular gel included in approximately the same amount polar groups (especially, free amines and amides) and non-polar groups corresponding to the presence of lipid droplets dispersed within the jelly material. It was concluded from the results obtained that the <b>gel-coat</b> of the skin surface is a chemically heterogeneous skin product.

40|$|Composite high {{pressure}} vessels are required in many engineering systems such as, gas fuel equipment for space and road vehicles, home gas appliances, rescue devices and therefore improvement of their specifications and production technology continue today. In this study, {{a new type}} of CNG composite cylinder without liner has been designed and manufactured. The major issues for manufacturing of a liner-less composite cylinder are selection of the mandrel material; this is because the mandrel should be water soluble or collapsible due to smaller openings at the ends as compared to the cylindrical portion and gas permeability. Aquapour and silica sand materials were selected for mandrel and found that these materials had good sustainability during the high tension and rotation of the winding process. Water solubility of these materials was proved after the successful removal of Aquapour and sand without any damage of the inner surface of the cylinder. <b>Gel-coat</b> and resin rich tissues were used as gas permeable materials. On the basis of the geodesic dome and design laminates sequence, a filament wound composite liner-less cylinder has been successfully manufactured. The mechanical properties and fracture behavior of nanocomposites and carbon fiber composites (CFRPs) containing organoclay in the epoxy matrix have been investigated. Epoxy/clay nanocomposites were fabricated from diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy and organoclay. A manufacturing process using the hand lay-up and hot pressing techniques was developed to produce carbon fiber-reinforced laminates with this nanocomposite matrix. The organoclay brought about a significant improvement in flexural modulus, and flexural strength especially in the first few wt% of clay loading. Flexural properties of CFRPs containing organoclay modified epoxy matrix generally followed a trend similar to the epoxy nanocomposite although the variation was much smaller for the CFRPs. It was also observed that the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of CFRPs improved by adding 3 wt% organoclay. These improved properties of fiber-reinforced polymer nanocomposites are achieved mostly due to the increased interfacial surface areas and improved bond characteristics of the epoxy-clay nanocomposites. The influence of nanoclay on the impact damage resistance of carbon fibre-epoxy (CFRP) composites has been investigated using the low-velocity impact and compression after impact (CAI) tests. The load-energy vs. time relations was analyzed to gain insight into the damage behaviours of the materials. The CFRPs containing organoclay brought about significant improvement in impact damage resistance and damage tolerance in the form of smaller damage area, higher residual strength and higher threshold energy level. The presence of nanoclay in the epoxy matrix induced the transition of failure mechanisms of CFRP laminates during the CAI test, from the brittle buckling mode to more ductile, multi-layer delamination mode. Addition of 3 wt% clay was shown to be an optimal content for the highest damage resistance...|$|E
