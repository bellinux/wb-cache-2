They also cautioned Hungary {{that if she}} joined the attack on Yugoslavia under any pretext, she must expect Britain and her allies to declare war, and if that occurred, could expect to be treated appropriately should the Allies be victorious. The British observed that Hungary had renounced its claims on Yugoslav territory when it signed the Treaty of Friendship, and that any attack on Yugoslavia would be a flagrant breach of the treaty.

5000|$|Telegram {{was open}} and working in Iran without any VPN or other {{circumvention}} methods in May 2015. In August 2015, the Iranian Ministry of ICT asserted that Telegram had agreed to restrict some of its bots and sticker packs in Iran {{at the request of}} the Iranian government. According to an article published on Global Voices, these features were being used by Iranians to [...] "share satirical comments about the Iranian government". The article also noted that [...] "some users are concerned that Telegram's willingness to comply with Iranian government requests might mean future complicity with other Iranian government censorship, or even allow <b>government</b> access to <b>Telegram's</b> data on Iranian users". Telegram has stated that all Telegram chats are private territory and that they do not process any requests related to them. Only requests regarding public content (bots and sticker packs) will be processed. In May 2016, the Iranian government asked all messaging apps, including Telegram to move all Iranian users' data to Iranian servers. On 20 April 2017, the Iranian <b>government</b> completely blocked <b>Telegram’s</b> new voice calls, a service that allows individuals to make calls via secure, end-to-end encryption, and keep their conversations private.|$|R

50|$|Although the Bulgarian {{government}} had officially joined the Axis Powers, it maintained {{a course of}} military passivity during {{the initial stages of}} the Invasion of Yugoslavia and the Battle of Greece. German, Italian, and Hungarian troops crushed opposing forces of Yugoslavia and Greece but on 6 April 1941, Yugoslavian airplanes bombed the Bulgarian town of Kyustendil, with 67 people killed and 90 wounded and a suburb of Sofia where 8 people were killed. The Yugoslav government surrendered on April 17. The Greek government was to hold out until April 30. On 18 April 1941 the Bulgarian <b>government</b> received a <b>telegram</b> from Joachim von Ribbentrop in which he specified the regions to be taken by units of the Bulgarian army. In Greece, the units were to occupy Thrace, as well as Macedonia between the Strymon and Nestos rivers. In Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians were to occupy an area from the river Vardar and Pomoravlje to the Pirot-Vranje-Skopje line.

They {{announced}} the expedition was {{at the invitation of}} several Mongolian princes to protect Mongolia from Bolshevik incursions. It was supposed to begin in July 1919, but the train broke down. In October, Xu led a spearhead group of 4,000 that quickly captured Urga without resistance. Another 10,000 troops followed to occupy the rest of the country. The successful invasion was met with acclaim throughout China, even by Sun Yat-sen's rival southern <b>government</b> although Sun's <b>telegram</b> could be interpreted sarcastically. The Japanese were the ones who ordered the pro Japanese Chinese warlords to occupy Mongolia in order to halt a possibly revolutionary spillover from the Russian revolutionaries into Mongolia and Northern China. After the Chinese completed the occupation, the Japanese then abandoned them and left them on their own.

Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away. Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed {{to hide the fact that}} the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German <b>government</b> sent several <b>telegrams</b> to Russia demanding [...] "the safety of the princesses of German blood". Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.|$|R

On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty. On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed. The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz.|$|R

25|$|In early October 1918, the Ottomans {{pulled back}} from {{southern}} Lori, which eliminated the territorial buffer between Armenia and Georgia. The Armenian military quickly filled the void by taking control of much of southern Lori on 18 October {{and in the absence}} of any resistance probed further north. The first incident between Armenia and Georgia occurred the same day when an Armenian army detachment seized the railway station in the village of Kober near Tumanyan, refusing a subsequent demand from the Germans that they withdraw. The local border guards called for help, and the Georgian government responded by sending two armored trains and a detachment of 250 soldiers, which forced the Armenians to leave Kober. Five days later, three Armenian companies attacked and overwhelmed a German garrison near the village of Karinj. Earlier, the Georgian government in Tbilisi had received a letter from Armenian Prime Minister Hovhannes Kajaznuni insisting that Georgia had no claims on the Lori district, and for the sake of avoiding a catastrophic crisis for both countries, Georgian troops should leave the region. Clashes intensified from 25–27 October, with neither side gaining the advantage, until the Georgians sent a company-sized force with an armored train to support their German allies. Just a day later, the Georgian <b>government</b> received a <b>telegram</b> from Armenia explaining that the attacks were the result of a misunderstanding and proposed that a conference be convened to resolve the border issue. On 27 October, Armenian troops left the two villages, they had occupied, and retreated south.|$|R

The Damas wrote a letter to Calles and physically protested government troops in front of Sacred Family Church.

They were shot down with waterholes and got up, throwing rocks at soldiers, until the men charged them away. A Feminine Brigade army of 5000 women went to governor’s secretary and asked to meet Colonel Tejada. They were denied and a similar event happened to them, with the Police Inspector General Roberto Cruz lashing his whip at some of the women.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} cases of {{political}} violence in the Presidential Era is the Nitrate Massacre in June 1925. Rising tensions between the nitrate workers, {{the government and the}} nitrate companies, due to unfair wages and work conditions, led to various strikes. In June 1925 the police interrupted a nitrate labor meeting in Alto San Alto, the day before a general strike was to be held. After an altercation two policemen were killed. The nitrate workers fled to different camps, La Coruña being the primary meeting place. Three different accounts exist as to what started the massacre. Military reports state, workers formed under the direction of Carlos Garrido, an anarchist, who under the direction from the Workers’ Federation, called on the nitrate workers to fight. Another account claims the conflict came after the wife of a miner was beaten by a store manager and in retaliation the husband stabbed the manager. Leftist political parties claim the government incited the conflict by allowing the nitrate workers to buy as much alcohol as they wished. Then, after the start of the strike, prohibiting the sale of alcohol lead the drunken workers to fire shots at a store manager. Whatever account is true, certainty rests in the account of the <b>government’s</b> reaction. A <b>telegram</b> from General Antonio de la Guarda to President Alessandri explains that when the government sent in regiments of cannons and machine guns to subdue the miners, the nitrate workers threw sticks of dynamite at the army. The army then bombarded the miners who eventually surrendered, but only after fifty-nine of their fellow workers were killed. In the following weeks the military rounded up nitrate workers from several camps and nearby towns, shooting some on sight, while imprisoning hundreds more who were then subjected to military justice.|$|R
60|$|At {{home the}} {{sensation}} was profound. The hysterical complaints about {{our men and}} officers, General Wood wrote to Childers, “are more like French character than English used to be.” Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues had a political question to consider. Colley could not be technically accused of want of good faith in moving forward on the 26th, as {{the time that he}} had appointed had expired. But though Majuba is just inside Natal—some four miles over the border—his advance was, under the circumstances of the moment, essentially an aggressive movement. Could his defeat justify us in withdrawing our previous proposals to the Boers? Was a military miscarriage, of no magnitude in itself, to be turned into a plea for abandoning a policy deliberately adopted for what were thought powerful and decisive reasons? “Suppose, for argument’s sake,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Kimberley when the sinister news arrived (Mar. 2), “that at the moment when Colley made the unhappy attack on Majuba Hill, there shall turn out to have been decided on, and possibly on its way, a satisfactory or friendly reply from the Boer <b>government</b> to your <b>telegram?</b> I fear the chances may be against this; but if it prove to be the case, we could not because we had failed on Sunday last, insist on shedding more blood.” As it happened, the Boer answer was decided on before the attack at Majuba, and was sent to Colley by Kruger at Heidelberg in ignorance of the event, the day after the ill-fated general’s death. The members of the Transvaal government set out their gratitude for the declaration that under certain conditions the government of the Queen was inclined to cease hostilities; and expressed their opinion that a meeting of representatives from both sides would probably lead with all speed to a satisfactory result. This reply was despatched by Kruger on the day on which Colley’s letter of the 21st came into his hands (Feb. 28), and it reached Colley’s successor on March 7.|$|R

Condolences were written to Chow from many military and Nationalist government luminaries including Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Yat-sen's son Sun Fo, Nationalist General Chang Hsueh-liang (Zhang Xueliang who was nicknamed Young Marshal and was a former warlord of Manchuria and Soong Tse-ven, a prominent businessman whose three brothers-in-law were Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and financier H.H.

In the early stages of the war against Japan, Chow was based in Canton as Lieutenant General and chief of the general staff of the 12th army group in the seventh military region. From 1938-39, Chow was the section head in charge of military service in Canton. Chow was the head of the general staff of the seventh military region, lieutenant general and head of the general staff of the 12th military group from 1940-44.The Japanese army attacked British-controlled Hong Kong on December 8, 1941.

They sent a telegram to the Hong Kong government that if the British troops could hold out until the end of December, the 12th group army would arrive to help fight the enemy, Chow's biographers wrote.|$|R
