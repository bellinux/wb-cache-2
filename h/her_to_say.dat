25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E

In 1846 she attended a meeting which was addressed by prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in 1838. She contributed to fund-raising efforts in the abolitionist cause and maintained an interest in this for the next twenty years. Her brothers William, Philip and Russell and her sister Anna were also active in this campaign. In 1851 the return of a fugitive slave from Boston back to the southern states caused <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that the United States had [...] "committed an atrocious act... against humanity, against itself, against God."

Now, the way that I would say that {{and the way that}} I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E

Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim. Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians {{were killed in the}} attack, including eighteen women and ten {{children under the age of}} sixteen. Goran Radosavljević, a major in the Serbian Interior Ministry, said that [...] " [...] used women, children and the elderly as hostages." [...] Speaking of the attack, Yugoslav General Nebojša Pavković stated that it was [...] "a normal policing action against a well-known criminal. It was successful. The other details I don't remember." [...] The only survivor was Besarta Jashari, Hamëz Jashari's daughter.

500|$|In 1985, she {{audition}}ed for a guest spot as Cynthia in Cheers. The audition called for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> her line and {{walk off the}} set. Cartwright {{decided to take a}} chance on being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part. In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach Milton Katselas. He recommended that Cartwright study La Strada, a 1956 Italian film starring Giulietta Masina and directed by Federico Fellini. She began performing [...] "every imaginable scene" [...] from La Strada in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation. She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called In Search of Fellini, partially based on her voyage. The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a Drama-Logue Award after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film, which she succeeded in doing in 2017.|$|E
500|$|Wood {{has stated}} that Steffy refuses to give Liam up because of {{everything}} she has been through and lost. She said, [...] "It’s hard for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye and {{hard for her to}} leave...She wants somebody there but she is very broken inside." [...] After years of uncertainty, in which Liam is involved with Hope and Steffy, married to Steffy twice, never legally married to Hope, Steffy becomes pregnant with his child in 2013. Wood was shocked, and said that Steffy is a [...] "wild child" [...] who likes to go to nightclubs and ride motorcycles, but [...] "everything just stops" [...] with her pregnancy. Initially, Steffy does not tell Liam about the baby because she sees him in bed with Hope, and leaves for Paris. Liam discovers the truth and he marries Steffy at the Forrester Mansion. Just before discovering Steffy is carrying his child, Liam nearly marries Hope in a [...] "room service elopement" [...] scheme arranged by Brooke; an ambush that was described as [...] "evil" [...] by Daytime Confidential. Wood felt that Steffy is more mature and level-headed {{as a result of her}} pregnancy. Steffy later loses the child in a motorbike accident, and becomes unconscious.|$|E

500|$|Despite Ron being a {{very private}} person, {{including}} getting his birthdate redacted from all public documents, his background does occasionally come up. He {{was born in a}} small town to Tamara Swanson (referred to as [...] "Tammy 0" [...] by Ron) and a father unnamed in the series. He grew up on a farm in a small town and is shown to have enjoyed woodworking from an early age, building his first chair at age five. Ron is opposed to child labor laws, stating he got his first job at a sheet metal factory at age nine and, in two weeks, was running the floor. Ron says that at age eleven, he was offered a higher paying job at the tannery and attempted to do both jobs while going to middle school before realizing {{it would be better to}} only work at the sheet metal factory. Ron claimed that, at age 12, he went to prom and was working at a quarry. Ron moved in with his first wife, Tammy 1, who worked at the hospital he was born at and was his math and Sunday school teacher, when he was fifteen; he has said that although the circumstances were considered scandalous, people were too afraid of <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything. Ron said that at age eighteen, his father wanted him to work at the steel mill, but he chose to go to college instead.|$|E
2500|$|Later, however, he {{rejected}} epiphenomenalism. This, he argues, is because when Mary first sees red, she says [...] "wow", {{so it must}} be Mary's qualia that cause <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "there must be a reply" [...] reply.|$|E
