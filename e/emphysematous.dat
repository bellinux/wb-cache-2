50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of <b>emphysematous</b> cystitis include air in the bladder wall, altered mental status, severe abdominal pain, weakness, dark urine, dysuria, fever, lethargy, vomiting, as well as white blood cells and bacteria in the urine (Mccabe). Where some patients may be asymptomatic, others may present with septic shock (De Baets, Baert). Symptoms can vary greatly from patient to patient, which makes the disease difficult to diagnose. In some cases of <b>emphysematous</b> cystitis, patients do not even claim to have any urinary symptoms (Mokabberi). Urinary symptoms can include blood in the urine, increased urinary frequency, urgency, occasional incontinence, difficulty voiding, and burning sensation. <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis is often indicated in patients who have air in the urine (Bobba). In some cases, <b>emphysematous</b> cystitis can cause thickening of the bladder wall (Weerakkody). Clinical subcutaneous emphysema is a rare complication of <b>emphysematous</b> cystitis that has a poor prognosis (Ahmed-Ramadan, Blake).|$|E

50|$|Poorly {{ventilated}} alveoli do {{not generally}} empty {{at the same}} rate as healthy alveoli. Particularly in <b>emphysematous</b> lungs, diseased alveoli empty slowly, and so the CO2 concentration of the exhaled air increases progressively throughout the expiration.|$|E
50|$|Even when caught early, {{aggressive}} treatment is required (Bobba). Antibiotics are proven to cure <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis {{over time and}} {{reduce the amount of}} gas inside the bladder wall. Prognosis is poor if antibiotics are not used to treat the patient. Additional treatment consists of urinary drainage and good control of blood glucose. The treatment of underlying comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, is extremely important because they can intensify the infection (Gheonea, Bondari). Hyperbaric oxygen is an effective treatment, and has cured some cases in as little as 48 hours. Although it is unclear as to how gas formation occurs in <b>emphysematous</b> cystitis, it’s dependant on whether or not the patient has contributing diseases (Mccabe). Gas formation in diabetic patients diagnosed with <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis has been determined to occur due to the production of carbon dioxide {{as a result of the}} fermentation of the high concentrations of glucose. Gas formation in nondiabetic patients is most likely due the breaking down of urinary lactulose and tissue proteins. Inflammation caused by infection increases pressure and decreases circulation, which provides the perfect environment for bacteria to produce gas (Sereno).|$|E
50|$|Neutrophil elastase is an {{important}} protease enzyme that when expressed aberrantly can cause emphysema or <b>emphysematous</b> changes. This involves breakdown of the lung structure and increased airspaces. Mutations of the ELANE gene cause severe congenital neutropenia, which is a failure of neutrophils to mature.|$|E
50|$|Risk {{factors include}} {{catheter}} use and chronic urinary tract infections, being female, diabetes mellitus, neurogenic bladder, {{and being in}} an immunocompromised state (Weerakkody). In 50% of cases, patients are elderly and diabetic. Obstruction of the urinary tract as well as urinary stasis, often brought on by paralysis of the urinary tract, are also major risk factors in addition to diabetes (De Baets, Baert). Transplant recipients have also {{been found to be}} at risk (Weerakkody). Introduction of infection from external means was discovered in one case study where a male with no history of diabetes or abnormalities to his immune system had recently undergone a transrectal ultrasound needle-guided prostate biopsy contracted a severe case of sepsis, which led to a case of <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis. The patient went on to develop disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. After a stay in Intensive Care undergoing broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient was eventually discharged in stable condition (Hashimoto, Takeshi). Patients diagnosed with <b>Emphysematous</b> Cystitis are also commonly diagnosed with urinary tract infections and sepsis (Mccabe). Cases of <b>Emphysematous</b> Cystitis in a clinical study have shown to progress quickly and are life threatening and sometimes fatal due to inflammation caused by gas forming organisms (Mokabberi).|$|E
50|$|Conventional LVRS {{involves}} resection of {{the most}} severely affected areas of <b>emphysematous,</b> non-bullous lung (aim is for 20-30%). This is a surgical option involving a mini-thoracotomy for patients suffering end stage COPD due to underlying emphysema, and can improve lung elastic recoil as well as diaphragmatic function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emphysematous</b> {{cystitis}} {{is a rare}} type {{of infection}} of the bladder wall by gas-forming bacteria or fungi. The most frequent offending organism is E. Coli. Other gram negative bacteria, including Klebsiella and Proteus are also commonly isolated. Fungi, such as Candida has also been reported as a causative organism. Citrobacter and Enterococci have also been found to cause <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis (Mokabberi). Although it is a rare type of bladder infection, {{it is the most}} common type of all gas-forming bladder infections (Mccabe). The condition is characterized by the formation of air bubbles in and around the bladder wall. The gas found in the bladder consists of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. The disease most commonly affects elderly diabetic and immunocompromised patients (Sereno). The first case was identified in a post-mortem examination in 1888 (Nemati, Basra).|$|E
50|$|Infections due to C. {{perfringens}} show {{evidence of}} tissue necrosis, bacteremia, <b>emphysematous</b> cholecystitis, and gas gangrene, {{which is also}} known as clostridial myonecrosis. The toxin involved in gas gangrene is known as α-toxin, which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells, producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function. C. perfringens can participate in polymicrobial anaerobic infections. Clostridium perfringens is commonly encountered in infections as a component of the normal flora. In this case, its role in disease is minor.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{atypical}} {{presentation and}} rarity of the infection, {{it takes a}} physician longer to diagnose than more common types of bladder infections. Diagnosis requires a personalized investigation with consideration to risk factors and symptoms (Bobba). Radiology of the abdominal or pubic region {{has proven to be}} an important tool in reaching a definitive diagnosis of conditions causing gas in the urinary tract. Computer tomography, or CT scans, are of most help due to their high sensitivity in detecting gas and air bubbles (Gheonea, Bondari). However, radiology is normally not the first tool used to diagnose. Most diagnoses are made by chance after imaging examination (Weerakkody). Sometimes, even when patients don’t show symptoms, their <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis infection level can be very advanced already (De Baets, Baert). Gas in the bladder wall will often have the appearance of cobblestone or a “beaded necklace” with the use of conventional radiography (Weerakkody). Delayed diagnosis can lead to a severe infection, extension of the uterus, rupturing of the bladder, and death. <b>Emphysematous</b> cystitis has an overall mortality rate of 7%. However, surgery is only considered in severe cases where the disease progresses involving the ureters, kidneys, or adrenal glands. When required, surgery may be extensive. (De Baets, Baert).|$|E
5000|$|Edwardsiella tarda is {{a member}} of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The {{bacterium}} is a facultatively anaerobic, small, motile, gram negative, straight rod with flagella. Infection causes Edwardsiella septicemia (also known as ES, edwardsiellosis, <b>emphysematous</b> putrefactive disease of catfish, fish gangrene, and red disease) in channel fish, eels, and flounder. Edwardsiella tarda is also found in largemouth bass and freshwater species such as rainbow trout. It is a zoonosis and can infect a variety of animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Edwardsiella tarda has also been the cause of periodic infections for various animals within zoos. E. tarda has a worldwide distribution and can be found in pond water, mud, and the intestine of fish and other marine animals. [...] It is spread by carrier animal feces.|$|E
50|$|Recent genomic {{research}} suggests that GHK directly modulates gene expression, which may explain the diversity of its biological actions. Iorio et al. used a repository of transcriptional responses to compounds, the Connectivity Map (cMap), and MANTRA software to explore networks of compounds producing similar transcriptional responses. GHK, {{as one of the}} compounds studied, increased mRNA production in 268 genes while suppressing 167.GHK was found to reverse the gene-expression signature of <b>emphysematous</b> destruction found in lung tissue obtained from smokers with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). The gene expression signature associated with emphysema severity included 127 genes, involved in inflammation and repair. Using the Connectivity Map, researchers established that the peptide GHK downregulated genes involved in lung destruction and inflammation, while upregulating genes involved in tissue repair. Addition of 10 nanomolar GHK to lung fibroblasts from emphysema lungs restored their ability to remodel collagen and assemble it into properly organized fibrils.|$|E
50|$|The one-way endobronchial valve is {{typically}} implanted such {{that when a}} patient exhales, air is able to flow through the valve {{and out of the}} lung compartment that is fed by that airway, but when the patient inhales, the valve closes and blocks air from entering that lung compartment. Thus, an implanted endobronchial valve typically helps a lung compartment to empty itself of air. This {{has been shown to be}} beneficial in the treatment of emphysema, where lungs lose their elasticity and thus cannot contract sufficiently to exhale air, leading to air trapping and hyperaeration. When one or more diseased portions of an <b>emphysematous</b> lung are made to deflate and collapse, other healthier portions of the lung have more room in the chest cavity to inhale and exhale, pressure is removed from the diaphragm, and even the heart may function better as the hyper-inflated lung becomes smaller. Endobronchial valves have also been shown to be beneficial in treatment of persistent air leaks in the lungs. It has also been theorized that endobronchial valves may be useful for treatment of tuberculosis and its complications. Endobronchial valves may be the first successful medical device treatment of emphysema, a disease that affects billions of patients worldwide and has no known cure, being managed traditionally by lung transplantation and/or lung volume reduction surgery (though some patients do not meet the eligibility requirements for one or both of these invasive procedures).|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{teaching was}} that air {{trapped in the}} <b>emphysematous</b> lung was trapped {{and could not be}} exhaled. For this reason the diaphragm was pushed down to a flat position and the ribs were elevated. Now I told Carl in no uncertain words that he was mildly demented to say that he could effect a rise in the diaphragm and a descent in the ribs, but then in one patient we got rather spectacular results showing that he did do this. Now {{what this means is that}} when Carl affects the coordination of all the groups of breathing muscles and the individual breathing muscles including the diaphragm and the abdomen and those around the neck and the throat, (that's) why the air can flow out of these areas which remain obstructed under every other circumstance and we have shown that he's able to decrease the volume of the lungs more than any pulmonary man would say it was possible. The function of the diaphragm redeveloped and he- Carl- refers to this quite correctly as re-development or development of the diaphragm. Now many studies that have been done in the last 5 years have been done at the wrong end of the spectrum. They studied how forcibly the diaphragm can pull down in an respiration. That's not the important thing. The important thing is what Carl has shown, that the diaphragm can be gotten to relax and go up, to rise so that during respiration it can come down. It's got plenty of strength, so there's no need to measure the strength.|$|E

Exterior of the small intestine was lined with several prominent tumors dark in color, 37 in total. Most of the tumors {{were found between the}} outside muscular layer and the bowel’s peritoneal covering of the bowel. The tumors were generally small and varied in shape, from smooth ovular masses to flat button shapes to elongated masses akin to a leech; they were elevated by as much as 6 to 8 mm above the bowl surface. These nodules were found to contain one worm each, no more, no less. In the interior of the small intestine, twenty nodules were found along the walls, causing a discernible bulging of the mucous membrane. The caecum walls were irregularly thickened and dark in color, with three ovular tumors containing immature adult Oesophagostomum. Interior of the caecum was filled with rope-like opaque masses of rows of cystic tumors, which caused great thicking of the walls. Examination of the exterior of the ascending colon revealed the formation of thick adhesions spanning the whole length of the colon; these adhesions were filled with fat, enlarged glands and omental tissue. Underneath were a multitude of small cystic tumors that ruptured upon disturbance of the adhesion, disclosing small worms. The interior of the colon was most affected, with tumors of widely varying shapes and sizes occupying the walls and floor of the gut, causing as much as 5 mm of thickening of colon walls.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONGas {{located within}} the gastric wall is a rare finding that is {{associated}} with a mortality rate of 50 %. It confers two main diagnoses: gastric emphysema and <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis. Due to its high mortality rate, <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis must be differentiated from gastric emphysema early to avoid adverse outcomes and plan the management of these patients. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe introduce a 55 year-old male who presents with diffuse abdominal pain associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patient has positive peritoneal signs with fever and leukocytosis. Air in the gastric wall and portal venous system was visualized on Computed Tomography (CT). The patient underwent emergent laparotomy which showed normal bowel with few adhesions. DISCUSSIONVarious etiologies can cause gas within the gastric wall but concomitant air in the hepatic venous system is highly suspicious for <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis. CT imaging is the most sensitive and specific way to differentiate <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis versus gastric emphysema. Although rare, there are many cases of <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis that undergo prompt surgical exploration. Recently, however, medical treatment has become more common and surgical management reserved for complications. CONCLUSIONWe conclude by stating that this case of <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis, due to gastric ulcers, would have no difference in outcome if treated medically instead of surgically. Historically, patients with <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis warranted surgical intervention. More recently, case reports of <b>emphysematous</b> gastritis are favoring conservative management. The consensus still remains that there is no standard approach for these patients and most patients in extremis are undergoing surgical intervention...|$|E
