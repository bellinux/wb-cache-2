These treasures consisted of great and valuable stores of gold, silver, precious stones, garments of the highest cost, and weapons, and vessels of exquisite workmanship and great value, the hereditary possessions of the Egyptian kings. She also sent to the mausoleum an immense quantity of <b>flax,</b> <b>tow,</b> torches, and other combustibles. These she stored in the lower apartments of the monument, with the desperate determination of burning herself and her treasures together rather than to {{fall into the hands of}} the Romans.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the textile}} industry, a tow is a coarse, broken fibre, removed during {{processing}} flax, hemp, or jute. Flax tows {{are often used}} as upholstery stuffing, and tows in general are frequently cut up to produce staple fibre.

During this project several Setralit fiber types were being used for the first time. They had been generated by a chemical, thermal and/or mechanical treatment of <b>flax</b> <b>tow</b> which is a side product of the textile industry. The German popular press praised this approach as a ”sensational invention“.|$|E

50|$|The shorter fibers {{that remain}} in the {{heckling}} comb after the flax has been combed are called tow. If the heckle is fine enough, the tow can be carded like wool and spun, otherwise it can be spun like the other <b>flax</b> fibers. <b>Tow</b> produces a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. While this yarn is not suitable for fine linens, {{it can be used}} for bagging, rough sheets, cords or ropes.|$|R
50|$|The Setralit {{techniques}} are applied either on crushed dry straw of bast fiber plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, <b>flax</b> <b>tow).</b> In {{the first case}} the fiber has to be separated mechanically, after the ultrasonic break-down, from its non-fibrous components (shives). As a benefit one gets clean shives as a byproduct which {{can serve as a}} raw material for high quality fiber powder. With the help of modified Setralit techniques the shives may also be upgraded separately.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1812, by Joseph Taylor, Joshua Wordsworth and Nathaniel Marshall. They had previously been employed by the brothers, Joseph and William Drabble, as workmen at a machine-making factory, Midland Mills, in Water Lane, Leeds. Midland Mills had originally been built for John Jubb, probably {{the same as the}} John Jubb who had married a Sarah Drabble in Doncaster in 1774. [...] On 7 November 1812 a notice in the local paper, the Leeds Mercury, announced that ‘Messrs Taylor, Wordsworth and Marshall, <b>Flax</b> <b>Tow</b> and Worsted Machine-Makers (late Workmen to Mr William Drabble) … have engaged a Commodious Place in Holbeck, where they intend carrying on the above business in all its branches’. [...] On 19 December 1812 the Mercury reported that William Drabble had been declared bankrupt, and advertised all his factory machinery and household furniture for sale by auction. [...] In May 1813 his premises in Water Lane - a factory three stories high, a warehouse and a building used as a saw pit - were up for sale. [...] In June 1814, ‘Messrs Taylor, Wordsworth and Marshall’ placed an announcement in the Mercury, announcing that they were moving into the Drabbles’ former premises and advertising for workers.|$|E
5000|$|During the 19th century, {{the village}} {{gradually}} expanded following {{the introduction of}} larger scale industries to the area, including manufacture of machinery for flax mills in 1811. [...] James Low and Robert Fairweather had set up their foundry in the village {{at the start of}} the nineteenth century and in 1815 developed the first carding machine for <b>flax</b> <b>tow</b> in the area. With the growth of the textile industry in Dundee and Angus the business grew rapidly, and, by the late nineteenth century, James F Low & Co Ltd was producing a wide range of machines used for the processing and spinning of jute, flax and similar fibres. As well as building machinery for local use, the firm attracted orders from across the world and by the 1880s the Monifieth Foundry employed about 300 workers. The expansion of Monifieth's industrial economy was aided by the opening of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on 6 October 1838. This railway, which was originally intended only as a local line, was constructed with an unusual gauge of [...] (shared only with the Arbroath and Forfar Railway), later being converted to standard gauge when it was incorporated into the national Rail system. Between 1861 and 1901, Monifieth's population more than tripled; from 558 to 2,134 and in 1895, Monifieth was registered at Forfar Sheriff Court as a burgh. A tramway service was introduced in 1905, with cars journeying into Dundee City centre at regular intervals. This service was welcomed by the many who travelled daily either from the Burgh into the City on business, or the many hundreds who commuted daily to work in the factories and mills.|$|E

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that grid-like knitted fabrics from flax fibres should be embedded in light-weight concrete, cellular concrete and plaster, investigations were performed on various yarns from flax fibres under near-practical conditions (pH-value 12, temperature 80 - 190 C, storage time up to 10 hours). At increasing temperature and storage {{time there was a}} different decrease of the maximum tensile force in connection with a reduction of the other testing features (Tt, EpsH, fibre length) according to the texture and fineness of the flax yarns. It was proved that yarns from flax fibres and <b>flax</b> <b>tows</b> can be processed on knitting machines (raschel knitting machines, stitch-bonding and small circular warp knitting machines) to knitted grids with different mesh sizes and net mesh structures without problems. Surprisingly it was found that there was nearly no degradation at the immersion in alkali for net grids with mesh legs of a high packing density. Single tests for the reinforcement of test beams from light-weight concrete and plaster were performed with the producted knittted grids. The bending tensile tests with light-weight concrete (cement mortar with light-weight aggregates) result in a slight increase of the bending tensile strength and with cellular concrete partly in a substantial increase of the same. The reinforcing tests with plaster did not result in an increase of the bending tensile strength. For all reinforced variants a distinct reduction of the crack propagation was determined. Fundamental informations on the adhesive bond and the concrete compatibility were obtained. Due to the shortened time for the subject matter systematic repeat tests were not possible so that a statistical assurance {{of the results of the}} reinforcing tests can only be attained in a later timeSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1176 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

This Greek fire was a celebrated means of warfare in those days, and was very terrible in its nature and effects. It is not known precisely what it was, or how it was made. It was an exceedingly combustible substance, and was to be thrown, on fire, at the enemy; and such was its nature, that when once in flames nothing could extinguish it; and, besides the heat and burning that it produced, it threw out great volumes of poisonous and stifling vapors, which suffocated all that came near. The men threw it sometimes in balls, sometimes {{on the ends of}} darts and arrows, where it was enveloped in <b>flax</b> or <b>tow</b> to keep it in its place. It burned fiercely and furiously wherever it fell. Even water did not extinguish it, and it was said that in this combat the sea all around the Saracens' ship seemed on fire, and the decks of the galleys that attacked them were blazing with it in every direction. Great numbers of Richard's men were killed by it.|$|R

To assess {{the potential of the}} <b>flax</b> <b>tow</b> architecture for composites manufacturing, the <b>flax</b> <b>tow</b> was characterised in tension under various conditions. The effect of the gauge length and the strain rate were studied on the dry reinforcement. It has been found that the mechanical properties can vary significantly depending on the loaded length. A characteristic length from which the mechanical properties are stable has been identified. At this characteristic length, the effect of the strain rate on the tensile properties was measured. The evolutions of the mechanical properties are discussed in relation to the distribution of elementary fibres within the tow.

40|$|International audienceTo {{study the}} {{potential}} of flax tows in composite processing {{as an alternative to}} flax spun yarns, a flat <b>flax</b> <b>tow</b> consisting of aligned fibre bundles held together by a natural binder was used and characterised in tension under various conditions. The effect of the gauge length was studied on the dry reinforcement. The experimental results showed that the mechanical properties and failure mechanism varied significantly depending on the gauge length and are discussed in relation to the distribution of elementary fibres within the tow. A characteristic length as from which the mechanical properties are stable has been identified. At this length, the effect of the strain rate on the tensile properties was measured and their sensitivity to the strain rate suggests a viscous effect in the behaviour of the <b>flax</b> <b>tow.</b> To approach process conditions such as wet filament winding, a batch of specimens was impregnated with epoxy prior to tensile testing. The tensile properties under wet conditions were found to be close to the properties under dry conditions and shows that the tow can withstand typical processing tensions. Finally, tensile tests on cured-impregnated tows showed interesting mechanical properties for composite application...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: scutched fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There {{is a need}} for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of scutched flax and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of scutched <b>flax.</b> <b>Tow</b> bundles were 15 % shorter than scutched flax bundles and tow bundles were 25 % thicker than scutched flax bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of scutched flax allowed volume fractions of 0. 7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0. 6. Despite the visual and morphological difference between tows and scutched flax both can be good candidates for composite reinforcement in high performance applications...|$|E
5000|$|... ‘…Leeds {{is just as}} {{tranquil}} {{as though}} no Strike had ever been, and as though no ‘yeos’, ‘blues’ or bayonetteers had been imported…The bells ring and the shops open, and mill tyranny goes on, {{and those who have}} any employment go to it, and those who have none starve quietly and patiently in the streets…’. But the economic situation remained difficult for the manufacturers too. The Leeds Mercury in the late 1830s and early 1840s carried many public notices of auctions of the equipment of bankrupt firms, which showed that they had been using - and so were now dumping on the second-hand market - machinery made by Taylor Wordsworth and Co, among others. Wordsworth was one of six machine-makers who were reported by the Mercury to have gone to London in February 1843, to the Board of Trade, to ask Lord Ripon for the law to be changed to allow the export of English-made <b>flax</b> and <b>tow</b> machines - in view of ‘the depressed state of the trade in that important branch of manufacturing industry’. [...] This was a complete turn-around in the manufacturers' position; in January 1827 Taylor Wordsworth and Co had joined many other Leeds manufacturers in publicly lobbying against a planned Bill to legalise the export of machinery, noting that 'great Danger may accrue to the Manufacturing Interests of the Kingdom if such Bill passed into a Law'. [...] Times were hard. A 'calamitous fire' at the company's works in February 1844 didn't help; but the firm had invested in a Leeds Water Works Company 'Fire Plug' (an early sort of hydrant, located in the factory), which averted complete disaster and which the company warmly recommended to others in the newspaper's account. Joshua Wordsworth had been appointed a Director of the Leeds Water Works in 1841.|$|R
5000|$|The {{workplaces}} {{to which}} the act applies are, first, [...] " [...] factories [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] workshops [...] "; secondly, laundries, docks, wharves, &c., enumerated above as introduced and regulated partially only by the act of 1895 and subsequent acts. Apart from this secondary list, and having regard to workplaces which remain undefined by the law, the act may broadly be said to apply to premises, rooms or places in which manual labour, {{with or without the}} aid of mechanical power, is exercised for gain in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, washing, cleaning or finishing or adapting for sale of any article or part of any article. If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works (brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, etc., before workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories whether power is used in them or not. Factories are, again, subdivided into textile and non-textile: they are textile if the machinery is employed in preparing, manufacturing or finishing cotton, wool, hair, silk, <b>flax,</b> hemp, jute, <b>tow,</b> China grass, coconut fibre or other like material either separately or mixed together, or mixed with any other material, or any fabric made thereof; all other factories are non-textile. The distinction turns on the historical origin of factory regulation and the regulations in textile factories remain in some respects slightly more stringent than in the non-textile factories and workshops, though the general provisions are almost the same. Three special classes of workshops have for certain purposes to be distinguished from ordinary workshops, which include tenement workshops: ...|$|R
