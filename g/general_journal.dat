50|$|A journal is {{also named}} {{the book of}} {{original}} entry, from when transactions were written in a journal prior to manually posting them to the accounts in the general ledger or subsidiary ledger.

In such case, use of the <b>general</b> <b>journal</b> may be limited to non-routine and adjusting entries.|$|E
40|$|This study {{complements}} {{existing research}} on the contributions and rankings of female economists with a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of gender issues in U. S. economicsjournals. Assuming that labor economics and development economics are the fields most likely to examine gender issues, I compare the incidence of gender-related articles {{in the last decade}} in leading U. S. <b>general</b> economics <b>journals</b> with top journals in the labor and development fields. I also examine the gender composition of authors of gender-related articles in all journals. Results indicate that the highest ranked field journals publish a higher percentage of articles on gender than do the leading <b>general</b> <b>journals</b> from among their labor and development papers. And unlike the common perception, a disproportionate number of the gender articles are written by men rather than women, particularly in the labor and <b>general</b> <b>journals.</b> The results suggest that departments that use publication in <b>general</b> <b>journals</b> as a proxy for overall research quality, and which do not consider alternative evaluations of research as potential full substitutes, may be using biased measures of the quality and importance of research on gender. The publication policies of <b>general</b> economics <b>journals</b> and the promotion policies of certain economics departments may have a direct effect in reducing both the number and perceived prestige of voices addressing issues of gender in economics.

40|$|Most {{articles}} in top <b>general</b> surgical <b>journals</b> seem to originate from a limited few developed countries. The {{purpose of this}} study was to establish which countries publish the most in leading <b>general</b> surgical <b>journals.</b> Methods: We analysed all the studies, reviews and case reports published in 2003 - 2004 in 10 leading English-language <b>general</b> surgical <b>journals</b> with the highest impact factors to obtain country-wise data with regard to the origin of articles. Editorials, historical articles, commentaries, guidelines, biographies, interviews and letters to editors were excluded from the analysis. Results: A total of 5, 081 articles were reviewed. Out of these, 834 were excluded as detailed above and the remaining 4, 247 articles were analysed. Most of these were from USA, European countries, Japan, and Australia. It seems that the vast majority of the world's population living in the developing countries do not find adequate representation in leading <b>general</b> surgical <b>journals.</b> Conclusion: Very few articles are published from developing countries in leading <b>general</b> surgical <b>journals.</b> Both developing countries and medical journals need to take steps to curb this trend. Steps are suggested to improve the situation so that the developing world is also adequately represented in the surgical literature...|$|R

Articles that study the relations between discourse and communication are specifically published in Discourse & Communication.|$|E
50|$|Journals are {{recorded}} in the <b>general</b> <b>journal</b> daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of financial transactions before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as debits and credits. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every debit journal entry recorded, {{there must be an}} equivalent credit journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.|$|E

50|$|At {{schools with}} more than one law review, {{membership}} on the main or flagship journal is normally considered more prestigious than membership on a specialty law journal. This is not the case at all schools, however. At many schools, the more prestigious journal is the specialty journal; a low-ranked <b>general</b> <b>journal</b> will rarely attract as much attention as a category-leading specialized journal. Often the best indicator is the age of the journal; a newer journal will rarely have the same clout with employers that the older journal has, even when the older journal is specialized. In any case, membership on any such journal is a valuable credential when searching out employment after law school.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>General</b> <b>Journal,</b> {{transactions}} are recorded in several lines (see Figure 1), and each transaction is posted to the general ledger separately. For example, if fifty sales on account were made during one day, fifty ledger postings {{would have to be}} made to three general ledger accounts: Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Sale Tax Payable. In special journal, {{transactions are}} recorded in a single line, and the format of the journal made it possible to post only the total amount for each account to the general ledger. For example, if fifty sales on account were made during one day, only the total amount for Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Sales Tax Payable were posted to the general ledger. Thus the posting process is more efficient. Figure 2 shows the example formats of the Special Journals.|$|E

By the middle of the 19th century, it was established that cysticercosis was caused by the ingestion of the eggs of T. solium.|$|E
