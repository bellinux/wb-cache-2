5|$|Night School {{partnered with}} iam8bit {{to create a}} collector's edition of the game, which {{featured}} <b>items</b> <b>like</b> a cassette tape demo of Ren's band in the game, {{a map of the}} island, poster, and code for the game.|$|E
5|$|The Fix {{problems}} section provides {{access to}} TuneUp Repair Wizard which allows users to selectively repair problems that TuneUp Utilities cannot automatically detect, e.g., icons getting corrupted or <b>items</b> <b>like</b> My Computer and Recycle Bin having permanently vanished from Windows Desktop.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made <b>items</b> <b>like</b> telephones, and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.|$|E
25|$|BRANDING: The hero {{is marked}} in some manner, perhaps {{receiving}} a distinctive scar or granted a cosmetic <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a ring or scarf.|$|R
50|$|In a {{competitive}} market, with many advertisers and many publications, defined prices and bid-based prices {{are likely to}} converge on the generally accepted value of an advertising action. This presumably reflects the expected sale value and the profit that will result from the sale. An <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a hotel room or airplane seat that loses all value if not sold may be priced at a higher ratio of sale value than an <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a bag of sand or box of nails that will retain its value over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{site also}} {{integrates}} with USB barcode scanners and webcams {{to capture the}} barcode of products for posting. Their technology will then populate auction’s details with known information about the <b>item,</b> <b>like</b> size and weight.|$|R
5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury <b>items</b> <b>like</b> shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both take them from sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the CHA {{decided to}} widen the range of {{possible}} cultural assets, including objects younger tha 50 years. Thus <b>items</b> <b>like</b> Kim Yuna's skates she wore at the 2010 Winter Olympics and the first train operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway in 1974 are also designated as cultural assets.|$|E
5|$|Even before Han's {{expansion}} into Central Asia, diplomat Zhang Qian's travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom); he also gathered information on Shendu (Indus River valley of North India) and Anxi (the Parthian Empire). All {{of these countries}} eventually received Han embassies. These connections {{marked the beginning of}} the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire, bringing Han <b>items</b> <b>like</b> silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} maps, {{multiple}} game modes, and multiple characters. Every character has a dual-function weapon (e.g., a revolver that fires strong shots {{up close and}} rapid shots at a distance) and a secondary <b>item,</b> <b>like</b> dynamite.|$|R
50|$|<b>Items</b> 2, <b>like</b> <b>Items</b> 1, occupy 1-2 slots but not {{necessary}} {{based on their}} strength. Unlike Items 1, each slot can store {{as many of the}} same items as the player have.|$|R
2500|$|These {{articles}} are derived historically from nominalized forms (as appear in relative clauses in Seri) of verbs: quiij ("that which sits"), caap ("that which stands"), coom ("that which lies"), quiih ("that (especially soft <b>item</b> <b>like</b> cloth) which is located"), moca ("that which comes"), contica ("that which goes"), and caahca ("that which is located"; root -ahca) ...|$|R
5|$|In the {{alternative}} image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown {{with his hands}} free. There are also differences in {{the wording of the}} letter and some <b>items,</b> <b>like</b> the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man to the left of Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged hourglass on the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{metalwork}} includes personal <b>items</b> <b>like</b> {{the gold}} lunula or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and {{are similar to}} those found in relatively large numbers in Ireland, but also with examples across Great Britain and in Portugal. Jet beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and Aberlemno in Angus.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative <b>items.</b> <b>Like</b> amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
50|$|Edward G. Robles, Jr. wrote a short {{science fiction}} story {{partially}} based around the song. It involved several homeless men who find an <b>item</b> <b>like</b> the one {{described in the}} song. In the story, the item is discovered to be an alien disguised as something nobody wants. It was originally copyrighted by Galaxy Publishing Corp. in 1954.|$|R
50|$|A gun {{projectile}} {{may be a}} simple, single-piece <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a bullet, {{a casing}} containing a payload like a shotshell or explosive shell, or complex projectile like a sub-caliber projectile and sabot. The propellant may be air, an explosive solid, or an explosive liquid. Some variations like the Gyrojet and certain other types combine the projectile and propellant into a single item.|$|R
50|$|Derivative action makes {{a control}} system behave much more intelligently. On control systems like the tuning of the {{temperature}} of a furnace, or perhaps the motion-control of a heavy <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a gun or camera on a moving vehicle, the derivative action of a well-tuned PID controller can allow it to reach and maintain a setpoint better than most skilled human operators could.|$|R
5|$|The islanders {{have many}} fine carvers, {{especially}} at Michael Tavioni's workshop and Island Craft, {{the latter of}} which produces <b>items</b> <b>like</b> spears and masks. Items are sold in places like Punanga Nui Market, Beachcomber Gallery and Bergman and Sons Crafts Store. Kenwalls Gallery displays paintings by local artists, and landscape artist Judith Kunzle sells her drawings and paintings in her home studio {{and several of the}} crafts stores, several of which have featured in numerous publications and postcards of the islands.|$|E
5|$|This last {{task was}} {{particularly}} unpopular with American prospectors, who faced paying {{an average of}} 25 percent {{of the value of}} their goods and supplies. The Mounties had a reputation for running these posts honestly, although accusations were made that they took bribes. Prospectors, on the other hand, tried to smuggle prize <b>items</b> <b>like</b> silk and whiskey across the pass in tins and bales of hay: the former item for the ladies, the latter for the saloons.|$|E
5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative <b>items</b> <b>like</b> lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Tonke Dragt uses {{elements}} of legends and fables, most clearly in Verhalen van de tweelingbroers. Her stories are mainly {{focused on one}} or a few male protagonists, often teenagers. They go on a personal quest, a search that may be externalized in an <b>item</b> <b>like</b> the letter in De brief voor de koning, but which results in a discovery of their own persona.|$|R
50|$|The {{home page}} of the site also {{features}} blog posts {{by a number of}} regular and guest contributors, which may be new rebuttals of a certain argument or simply the blogger's view on a relevant climate news <b>item.</b> <b>Like</b> the rebuttals, the blog entries tend to hold a consistent tone that the scientific opinion on anthropogenic global warming is generally accurate.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones are an {{integral}} part of everyday life, and more people buy the latest technology, including tourists. Technology evolves at an exponential pace, smartphones are increasingly becoming an indispensable accessory and less a luxury <b>item,</b> <b>like</b> it might have been considered before. The smartphones are now a powerful tool for tourists and travelers, thanks to the mobile applications that help so much the independent travelers...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} middles ages, there were {{distinct}} material cultures {{evident in the}} different linguistic groups, federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art {{can be seen in}} the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hordes like the St Ninian's Isle Treasure. Irish-Scots art from the Kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include <b>items</b> <b>like</b> the Hunterston brooch, which with other <b>items</b> <b>like</b> the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved High crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) feels {{powerless}} at {{work because}} a policy by Chris (Rob Lowe) forbidding workplace romances is preventing her from dating Ben (Adam Scott). Meanwhile, {{now that he}} is staying in Pawnee permanently, Ben decides {{to move out of the}} motel where he has been living. Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday <b>items</b> <b>like</b> plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable <b>items</b> <b>like</b> brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
50|$|Pearl growing is {{a metaphor}} taken from the process of small bits of sand growing to make a {{beautiful}} pearl, which is used in information literacy. Pearl Growing is in this context the process of using one information <b>item</b> (<b>like</b> a subject term or citation) to find more information. This search strategy is most successfully employed {{at the beginning of}} the research process as the searcher uncovers new pearls about his or her topic.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bedroom Bonanza": Forsberg {{will read}} out a {{description}} of an <b>item</b> <b>like</b> 'something you {{would never want to}} give away' and the contestants must race to find something matching that description in their bedroom. The first person back wins 3 of her 'priceless' Samojis. She may also give Samojis to people that chose something good, so if the description was 'something you would bring on a desert island' and someone brought a water bottle, they would get an extra Samoji.|$|R
5000|$|In {{fighting}} games, {{items are}} far less common, however they still appear in many titles. In wrestling games, things like folding chairs and other innocuous items are often used as makeshift weapons, sometimes with {{a limited number of}} [...] "uses" [...] before the item breaks. In the Super Smash Brothers series, items {{play an important role in}} the combat, and the timely arrival of a certain <b>item,</b> <b>like</b> invincibility or the hammer, can completely alter the course of the fight.|$|R
5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few <b>items</b> <b>like</b> biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovations}} of Andriamasinavalona {{were numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red parasol as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury <b>items</b> <b>like</b> silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} a {{classroom}} in a small, vacated island, surrounded by troops, and wearing metal collars around their necks. A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen {{to participate in the}} Program. They have three days to kill each other until one stands as the victor, or the metal collars will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless <b>items</b> <b>like</b> boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E
5000|$|The first, simple optical {{printers}} {{were constructed}} {{early in the}} 1920s. Linwood G. Dunn expanded the concept in the 1930s, and during World War II he was commissioned by the United States armed forces' photographic units to design an optical printer that could be ordered as a stock <b>item</b> <b>like</b> a camera. [...] Development continued well into the 1980s, when the printers were controlled with minicomputers. Prime examples of optical printing work include the matte work in Star Wars (1977).|$|R
