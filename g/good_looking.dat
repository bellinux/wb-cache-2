5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> {{by the standards of the}} period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Dev Gill was {{selected}} to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained adamant about casting him. He {{said that he had}} to cast a <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was already an experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in his role in the film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma {{was selected}} to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days. She was subsequently signed for Rajamouli's next project, Maryada Ramanna (2010), before Magadheera was even released.|$|E

25|$|Rattling Blanket Woman was the {{daughter}} of Black Buffalo and White Cow (also known as Iron Cane). Her older siblings were Lone Horn (born 1790, died 1877) and <b>Good</b> <b>Looking</b> Woman (born 1810). Her younger sister was named Looks At It (born 1815), later given the name They Are Afraid of Her. The historian George Hyde wrote that Rattling Blanket Woman was Miniconjou and the sister of Spotted Tail, who became a Brulé head chief.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duke Andrei was tall, shy and <b>good</b> <b>looking.</b> Efforts to {{make him}} settle down with a bride of royal blood were unsuccessful. He {{was very close to}} his mother, {{particularly}} {{after the death of his}} father in 1909, and manipulated her to his advantage, which his siblings resented. His pliable personality made him more popular within the Romanov family than his siblings. He was a good friend of his cousin Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, who was a year older.|$|E
25|$|Early {{on during}} the reign of Queen Christina (1644–1654) De la Gardie became the queen's favourite. Being, reportedly, both well-mannered and <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> might have helped De la Gardie to gain the queen's favour. His {{knowledge}} concerning culture, politics and representation might also have impressed the queen just as his talent for organizing festivities and surrounding himself with extravagance and magnificence. His skill and interest in the mentioned areas was in demand during a time when the power should not only be well-learned, resolute and rooted in history, but have a sense of details and possess splendour as well.|$|E

25|$|Australia won the toss after Andrew Flintoff called heads. Ricky Ponting {{elected to}} bat on a <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> pitch. Steve Harmison bowled the opening over, {{with the first}} ball a wide that went {{straight}} to Andrew Flintoff at second slip. Harmison only lasted two overs, which went for 17 runs, before being replaced by James Anderson. Anderson proved just as expensive as Harmison, conceding 10 runs in his first over in his first Test match for seven months. Andrew Flintoff got Matthew Hayden to edge one to second slip on 21. Australia reached lunch without further loss on 1/79.|$|E

His Hoosier drawl then disappears. From then on, he stays in New York and becomes a famous underwear model.|$|E
25|$|Nation's pilot script broadly resembled {{what would}} become The Way Back, the first Blake's 7 episode to be transmitted, {{although}} the agent who betrays Glyd's group and plots Blake's conviction was named Cral Travis, rather than Dev Tarrant in the transmitted episode. The proposed characters for the series were: Rog (later changed to Roj) Blake, Vila Restal, Jenna Stannis, Kerr Avon, Olag Gan, Arco Trent, Tone Selman and Brell Klein. The descriptions of Blake, Jenna and Gan {{are similar to those}} of the developed characters. However, Vila's character is somewhat different, described as “thirty five, <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> athletic”, he appears more similar to the popular fictional character Simon Templar than the Vila portrayed on screen. The Arco Trent character was described as a powerful figure in the Administration who had become a scapegoat for a group of corrupt officials involved in arms dealing. Arco would plot against Blake but would gain respect for Blake after Blake saves his life. Arco's sidekick would be Avon, a self-serving, treacherous coward. The characters of Selman and Klein did not appear in the pilot script, which noted that these characters would join the series in a later episode.|$|E

25|$|On {{the lower}} slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes {{has been used}} in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to {{extinction}} during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.|$|E

500|$|With the {{publication}} of In Patagonia, Chatwin invigorated the genre of travel writing; according to his biographer, Nicholas Murray, he [...] "showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre." [...] The combination of his clear yet vivid prose and an international perspective {{at a time when}} many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart. Aside from his writing, Chatwin was also <b>good</b> <b>looking,</b> and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity.

He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy This is the Night (1932), playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita. Grant disliked his role and threatened to leave Hollywood, but to his surprise a critic from Variety praised his performance, and thought that he looked like a [...] "potential femme rave".|$|E

500|$|Analyzing the show's {{impact on}} culture, Dessylyn Arnold of Yahoo! Voices {{noted that the}} [...] "mc-labeling" [...] trend has been parodied on other shows {{including}} ER and [...] Mark Lawson of The Guardian has credited Grey's Anatomy with popularizing the [...] "songtage", or musical montage segments. Parodying this, MADtv created a spoof on the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage. The show's premise inspired the creation of A Corazón Abierto, a Colombian adaptation of Grey's Anatomy, which in turn spawned a Mexican {{version of the same}} name. A study conducted by the University of Western Sydney revealed that 94% of 400 polled medical students are regular viewers of Grey's Anatomy. An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the University of Illinois indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being [...] "smart, <b>good</b> <b>looking,</b> capable, and interesting", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is described as}} both [...] "lethally charming ... <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> and utterly captivating", as well as [...] "flirtatious, cunning, clever {{and a bit of}} an action man". Within Doctor Who, Jack's personality is relatively light-hearted, although this changes in Torchwoods first series, where he becomes a darker character. In Torchwoods first series, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. In Torchwood, he would occasionally inquire or muse about the afterlife and religion, sympathising with a man's desire to die. Returning in Doctor Who Series Three, Jack indicates he now maintains a less suicidal outlook than before. In the second series of Torchwood, Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor. In the third series of Torchwood, the audience sees some of Jack's [...] "darker side", as well as [...] "the secrets that Jack has, the pressures, drama and the trauma he's carrying on his shoulders".|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly <b>good</b> <b>looking</b> throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E
