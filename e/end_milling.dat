40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> and also compared to the linear <b>end</b> <b>milling.</b> The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations.
