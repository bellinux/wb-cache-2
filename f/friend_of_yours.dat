[...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> but we've not been in contact for years. When I heard you have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now.

2500|$|Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, {{written by}} Dicks, gives further clarity {{to the history}} between the Doctor and the Master. When the Time Lord (played by David Garth in the {{original}} serial) comes to warn the Doctor, he states [...] "I've come to bring you a warning, an old <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> has arrived on Earth. These days he calls himself The Master." [...] The narrative states that [...] " [...] had been behind several interplanetary wars, always disappearing from the scene before he could be brought to justice. If ever he were caught, his fate would be far worse than the Doctor's exile. Once captured by the Time Lords, the Master's life-stream would be thrown into reverse. Not only would he no longer exist, {{he never would have}} existed." [...] The Doctor asks [...] "Is his TARDIS still working?". The Time Lord replies [...] "I'm afraid so. He got away before it could be de-energised." [...] "Then he was luckier than I" [...] said the Doctor sadly. He had never really got used to his exile. The Time Lord replies [...] "Don't be bitter Doctor, your punishment was comparatively light".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>yours,</b> this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
