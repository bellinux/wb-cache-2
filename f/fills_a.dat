5|$|A {{bartender}} {{is working}} at a saloon, serving drinks to customers. After he <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> stereotypically Irish man's bucket with beer, Carrie Nation and her followers burst inside. They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, propene was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). This {{is the first time}} propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen is an {{important}} and major component in all materials of organic chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays.

Eight African Americans have served in the Senate since the 1940s: Edward W. Brooke, a Republican from Massachusetts; Carol Moseley Braun, Barack Obama, and Roland Burris (appointed to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy), all Democrats from Illinois; Tim Scott (initially appointed to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy, but later elected), a Republican from South Carolina; Mo Cowan (appointed to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy), a Democrat from Massachusetts; Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California.|$|R

Multispectral IMINT is likely to discriminate more wavelengths, especially if it extends into the IR or UV, than a human being, even with an excellent color sense, could discriminate.|$|E
25|$|A {{catamaran}} configuration <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> {{niche for}} powered vessels, where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or {{operation in the}} littoral zone. Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) and the wave-piercing configuration—the latter having become a widely favored design.|$|E

Along with the Akash SAM, the LRSAM <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> longer range {{requirement}} and both types will complement each other.

25|$|The body is also {{responsible}} for the ICC Americas Championship, which is the premier international competition in the region, and allows teams to compete for World Cup qualification. The World Cup itself has only been held in the region on a single occasion, when the 2007 World Cup was hosted by the West Indies. The organisation is {{also responsible}} for hosting the ICC Americas Under-19 Championship, which <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> similar role in qualification for the Under-19 World Cup. A separate South American Cricket Championship exists, but is not organised by the ICC.|$|E

Astro attacks enemies using high-powered punches and kicks, which can also knock enemies into other ones and destroy them as well.

Once the gauge is filled, Astro is able to perform a special attack; rather than simply helping the player, these are required in some situations. Astro is also able to fly using rocket power, which is also sometimes necessary.|$|E

She bluffs {{her way into the}} DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom; one of his men arrives and announces that Léon had just killed one of the corrupt DEA agents in Chinatown that morning. Léon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, shooting two more of Stansfield's men in the process. An enraged Stansfield confronts Tony, who is violently interrogated for Léon's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nyos <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> roughly {{circular}} maar in the Oku Volcanic Field, {{an explosion}} crater caused when a lava flow interacted violently with groundwater. The maar {{is believed to}} have formed in an eruption about 400years ago, and is 1,800m (5,900ft) across and 208m (682ft) deep. The area has been volcanically active for millions of years—after South America and Africa were split apart by plate tectonics about 110million years ago, West Africa also experienced rifting, although to a lesser degree. The rift is known as the Mbéré Rift Valley, and crustal extension has allowed magma to reach the surface along a line extending through Cameroon. Mount Cameroon also lies on this fault line. Lake Nyos is surrounded by old lava flows and pyroclastic deposits.|$|E

25|$|Anticipating {{word from}} Antía, and {{aware that she}} owes her {{daughter}} {{an explanation of the}} events that led to their separation, Julieta <b>fills</b> <b>a</b> journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan, a fisherman and Antía's father. In a flashback, Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife who is in a coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Antía visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin.|$|E

The original Frankenstein is driven to insanity by his ostracization and Frankenstein, MD attempted to recontextualize this concept by gender-swapping its lead. Victoria Frankenstein is a medical student and later doctor grappling with institutional sexism in what the creators called the [...] "sort of a male-dominated profession" [...] of medicine.|$|E
