40|$|Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, {{defined as}} having a single transmembrane helix at their C terminus, are post-translationally {{targeted}} to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the guided entry of <b>TA</b> proteins (<b>GET)</b> pathway. In yeast, the handover of TA substrates is mediated by the heterotetrameric Get 4 /Get 5 complex (Get 4 / 5), which tethers the co-chaperone Sgt 2 to the targeting factor, the Get 3 ATPase. Binding of Get 4 / 5 to Get 3 is critical for efficient TA targeting; however, questions remain about {{the formation of the}} Get 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex. Here we report crystal structures of a Get 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2. 8 and 6. 0 Å that reveal a novel interface between Get 3 and Get 4 dominated by electrostatic interactions. Kinetic and mutational analyses strongly suggest that these structures represent an on-pathway intermediate that rapidly assembles and then rearranges to the final Get 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Get 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex is dominated by a single Get 4 / 5 heterotetramer bound to one monomer of a Get 3 dimer, uncovering an intriguing asymmetry in the Get 4 / 5 heterotetramer upon Get 3 binding.

40|$|Nearly 5 % of {{membrane}} proteins {{are guided}} to nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrial, Golgi, or peroxisomemem-branes by their C-terminal transmembrane domain and {{are classified as}} tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins. In Saccharomy-ces cerevisiae, the guided entry of <b>TA</b> protein (<b>GET)</b> pathway {{has been shown to}} function in the delivery of TA proteins to the ER. The sorting complex for this pathway is comprised of Sgt 2, Get 4, and Get 5 and facilitates the loading of nascent tail-anchored proteins onto the Get 3 ATPase. Multiple pulldown assays also indicated that Ybr 137 wp associates with this complex in vivo. Here, we report a 2. 8 -Å-resolution crystal structure for Ybr 137 wp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein is a decamer in the crystal and also in solution, as observed by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. In addition, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the C-terminal acidic motif of Ybr 137 wp interacts with the tetratricopeptide re-peat (TPR) domain of Sgt 2. Moreover, an in vivo study demonstrated that Ybr 137 wp is induced in yeast exiting the log phase and ameliorates the defect of TA protein delivery and cell viability derived by the impaired GET system under starvation conditions. Therefore, this study suggests a possible role for Ybr 137 wp related to targeting of tail-anchored proteins. Eukaryotic membrane-bound proteins have to be targeted tothemembranes. Approximately 5 % ofmembrane proteins are tail anchored (TA) to the membrane, and this class of integral membrane proteins can be grouped into the TA family (1 - 6).

40|$|Tail-anchored (TA) {{membrane}} proteins {{are involved}} in a variety of important cellular functions, including membrane fusion, protein translocation, and apoptosis. The ATPase Get 3 (Asna 1, TRC 40) was identified recently as the endoplasmic reticulum targeting factor of <b>TA</b> proteins. <b>Get</b> 3 consists of an ATPase and α-helical subdomain enriched in methionine and glycine residues. We present structural and biochemical analyses of Get 3 alone as well as in complex with a TA protein, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (Ramp 4). The ATPase domains form an extensive dimer interface that encloses 2 nucleotides in a head-to-head orientation and a zinc ion. Amide proton exchange mass spectrometry shows that the α-helical subdomain of Get 3 displays considerable flexibility in solution and maps the TA protein-binding site to the α-helical subdomain. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP-Mg 2 +- and ADP-Mg 2 +-bound crystal structures representing the pre- and posthydrolysis states are both in a closed form. In the absence of a TA protein cargo, ATP hydrolysis {{does not seem to be}} possible. Comparison with the ADP·AlF 4 −-bound structure representing the transition state (Mateja A, et al. (2009) Nature 461 : 361 – 366) indicates how the presence of a TA protein is communicated to the ATP-binding site. In vitro membrane insertion studies show that recombinant Get 3 inserts Ramp 4 in a nucleotide- and receptor-dependent manner. Although ATP hydrolysis is not required for Ramp 4 insertion per se, it seems to be required for efficient insertion. We postulate that ATP hydrolysis is needed to release Get 3 from its receptor. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into posttranslational targeting of TA membrane proteins by Get 3...|$|R
