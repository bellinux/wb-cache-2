5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, WWE {{announced}} {{on its website}} that a supplemental draft would take place on June 25 at noon ET. The supplemental draft, like the previous year, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections.

Unlike years past, during this draft, many employees in WWE were not told whether they were scripted to change brands.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico is a 1949 British comedy film made by Ealing Studios and {{starring}} Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford and Hermione Baddeley. It {{was directed}} by Henry Cornelius and written by T. E. B. Clarke. The story concerns the unearthing of treasure and documents that lead to {{a small part of}} Pimlico to be declared a legal part of the House of Burgundy, and therefore <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> post-war rationing or other bureaucratic restrictions active in Britain at the time.|$|E

While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The Székesfehérvár Chapter {{obstructed}} Ernuszt's canonical visitations to its estates in the Bishopric of Pécs and forbade {{the local}} priests from attending the episcopal synods. The chapter emphasized that its estates were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of all bishops in Hungary, but Ernuszt persuaded the Holy See to strengthen his {{authority over the}} parishes in question in 1478. He made one Anton (who was the titular Bishop of Megara) his coadjutor bishop in 1480 to secure the spiritual administration of the Pécs diocese.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495. The document is {{an important source of}} demographic, economic, and cultural research of late medieval Hungary. The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax assessed in Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 which was to be paid by each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of the southern border, was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax assessed in this region. The peasants in southern Slavonia were also <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one-florin tax because of the frequent Ottoman raids in this region.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} are <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Migratory Bird Treaty Act, {{which prohibits}} the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit {{is required to}} remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the era of}} Ottoman rule, and {{especially}} from the 17th to the 19th century, the local Greek Orthodox communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of Zagori acquired an autonomous status inside the Ottoman Empire, whereby the locals were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities. During this period large groups of villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions. In such an environment, the art of herbal healing by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.|$|E

5|$|Middleton was a {{township}} and chapelry {{dependent on}} Holy Trinity Church {{in the ancient}} parish of Rothwell in the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became an ecclesiastical parish after 1849. Between 1866 and 1920 it was a civil parish. Middleton {{was part of the}} Great Preston Gilbert Union from 1809 until 1862 which provided a workhouse and poor relief for the parishes within its jurisdiction. The Gilbert unions were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 but disbanded in 1862 and after that Middleton became part of the Kirkstall Poor Law Union until 1869 when it joined the Hunslet Poor Law Union until 1920, the same year it was incorporated into the City of Leeds.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 percent over the upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was among the worst funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys {{adhered to}} Roman Catholicism. The Diocese of Transylvania {{included}} {{most of the}} province, but the Saxons of Southern Transylvania were subjected to the archbishops of Esztergom. Catholic commoners were to pay an ecclesiastic tax, the tithe, but John XXIII exempted the lesser noblemen from paying it in 1415. However, George Lépes, the bishop of Transylvania, ignored this decision, especially after John had been declared an antipope. They were originally <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ecclesiastic tax, but Sigismund of Luxemburg, king of Hungary, decreed that the Vlachs who settled on lands abandoned by Catholic peasants were to also pay the tithe. Sigismund was an absent monarch, deeply involved in European politics; he spent much time outside Hungary, especially in his other realms, such as Germany and Bohemia.|$|E

5|$|The Public Records Act 1958 {{required}} {{all government}} departments {{to set up}} archives and records management systems. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was nominally <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> act, being a government corporation rather than a department, but voluntarily asked to be included under the Act. This created a position at the UKAEA for an historian and archivist. Gowing applied for and secured the job in 1959. This involved organising systems and criteria for the selection for preservation of scientific, engineering and administrative records, and writing {{the history of the}} British atomic project since it had begun in 1939, the UKAEA having inherited the files of predecessor organisations including the Tube Alloys Directorate.|$|E
5|$|With the Peace of Basel, the {{relations}} between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the empire returned to the status quo ante from before the Diet of Worms in 1495. The imperial ban was dropped silently. Maximilian had to accept the refusal of the cantons and to abandon implicitly the Habsburg claims on their territories, acknowledging their independence. Consequently, the then ten members of the Swiss Confederacy remained <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the Reichskammergericht. The Swiss henceforth exercised also the high justice over the Thurgau. The war had not caused any territorial changes, except in the area around Schaffhausen, where the city had succeeded to assert its hegemony over some places that had formerly belonged to the Bishop of Constance.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
