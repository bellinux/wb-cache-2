The Guwahati Refinery is the most important manufacturing industry in the city. Located at Noonmati, the refinery was set up by the Indian Oil Corporation Limited as the first public sector refinery of India as well as the refinery of Indian Oil since 1962. It was built with an initial crude processing capacity of 0.75nbsp&million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) {{at the time of its}} commission which was gradually increased to 1.0nbsp&MMTPA. It produces various products and supplies them to the other northeast states and also beyond to Siliguri through the Guwahati-Siliguri pipeline. The various products produced by the refinery include Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Kerosene Oil, Turbine Fuel (aviation use), Motor Spirit, <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Motor</b> Diesel, Light Diesel Oil and Raw Petroleum Coke.

50|$|By April 1942 {{there were}} around 80 to 90 boats at the {{training}} base, comprising {{a number of}} different flotillas.

Several harbour defence motor launches were also attached to defend the base. A number of different boats were attached at different times to serve as depot ships, training vessels and accommodation ships. The Admiralty Floating Drydock AFD 22 was used as the base's main repair facility.

50|$|Motor drives for {{compact and}} amateur cameras wind slowly - shot-to-shot {{intervals}} of approximately a second are commonplace. Professional grade cameras are faster, with {{speeds up to}} 10 frames per second (fps). The first 35 mm SLR to achieve such a shooting speed was Nikon's F <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Motor</b> Drive camera, first developed for the 1971 Chicago Photo Expo with 7 fps. To enable this speed and allow the photographer to more easily track the moving subject, this camera used a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror instead of a moving mirror. Later special Canon models used similar mechanisms to achieve such speeds, while cameras with moving mirrors reached approximately 5 frames per second by the 1980s. Today, the fastest professional models from Canon and Nikon achieve approximately 10 frames per second with a moving mirror.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- More {{electric}} aircraft {{has been}} a subject of increasing discussions and research {{for more than ten}} years now, both in Europe and in North America. These efforts follow the growing realisation of the benefits that are likely to emerge from the future growth of the more electric aircraft technology. This is clearly evident from the sizes and numbers of research and development programmes currently undertaken on the subject by both aerospace industry and academic institutions. <b>High</b> <b>speed</b> permanent magnet <b>motors,</b> excited by rare-earth magnetic materials, are used extensively in majority of these research programmes. The applications, on more electric aircrafts, often demand motor drives that have very high reliability, energy efficiency and high power density. One of the factors that require significant design consideration is the effect of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> on the operational performance of the <b>motor.</b> <b>High</b> rotational <b>speed</b> impacts heavily on the rotational losses whilst the <b>high</b> peripheral <b>speed</b> influences the mechanical construction of the rotor.
