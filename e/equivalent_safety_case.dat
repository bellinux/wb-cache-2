Goal Structural Notation {{is one of these}} modeling techniques, which can be used to facilitate the development of safety argumentation and create reusable safety argumentation models. Consequently, GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> are widely used to demonstrate the safety of systems in safety-critical domains. Due to the amount of manual work, constructing a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> is usually time-consuming. Moreover, the re-usability of GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> is limited. To address this, <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> patterns {{are introduced to}} support <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> reuse. As more and more GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> and patterns are designed with different goals in different contexts, it becomes hard to identify a reusable <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> or pattern. In this paper, we carried out a study on the categorization of existing GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> and patterns. As a result, a number of high cited publications are selected and studied. Finally a categorizatio n of GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> is proposed. A clear categorization of GSN-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> can be used to identify similar <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> or patterns and facilitate <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> reuse...|$|R
40|$|Context. In safety-critical domains, <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> {{are widely}} used to {{demonstrate}} the safety of systems. A <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> is an argumentation for showing confidence in the claimed safety assurance of a system, which should be comprehensible and well-structured. Typically, <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> can be represented in plain text or graphic way, such as Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). After <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> are developed, assessment of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> needs to be performed to check the quality of them. Besides, different roles are involved during this process: <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> developers and <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessors. Objective. During the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment process, <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessors are required to evaluate the validity of a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> and discuss their judgement with <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> developers. Currently, {{the outcome of a}} <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment and the way of providing judgement are not systematically supported, which may cause inconsistent outcomes and wrong judgements. Therefore a systematic process of <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment is required. Moreover, to support <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment in an efficient and effective way, tool support is needed. Recently, a number of <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> editors are developed to support <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development with the GSN. These editors support the development and management of <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> However, only a few editors offer limited functionalities for <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment {{which is one of the}} crucial phases of the safety assurance process. This motivates us to develop a tool to support <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment. Method. In this paper, we first identify two research questions. Resulting in two directions for further study have been identified: formalising the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment process and developing <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> tooling. First, we carried out a study on the state of art on <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment and <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> tooling. Based on our findings, we formalize the safety assessment process by identifying the typical steps in <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment. This assessment process can guide assessors to assess a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> from a general level to a detailed level and provide reliable and understandable feedback to developers. Finally two industrial case studies are carried out to validate the proposed assessment process. Results. To support the proposed process, a prototype tool for <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment was developed. A number of required features are implemented in the prototype tooling, among other it provides a complete and self-contained evaluation system to measure the quality of the <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Moreover, the case study validations show potential for facilitating safety assessment in practice. Conclusions. In this paper, two research questions are identified and the solutions of them are discussed. Then we propose a systematic approach for <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> assessment. For demonstration, a tool support is also developed. For validation two industrial case studies have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed process...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{major hazard}} facility operators with information {{to develop a}} <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline. A <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline is {{a plan for the}} preparation of a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> for a major hazard facility (MHF). It is essentially a project plan for the preparation of the <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> A well-developed <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline will help the MHF operator to plan for and produce a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> that meets the requirements of Chapter 9 of the Work Health and Safety Regulations. The <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline sets out information, including a timetable, to explain how the MHF operator will prepare a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> that meets these requirements. It should provide a clear picture of what the operator will do, how and when. The <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline may also be used by the regulator to plan its interactions (such as site visits or requests for further information). The intended outcome is a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> outline that meets regulatory requirements and will be used by the operator as a project plan for the preparation of an acceptable <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> delivered on time to the regulator. The <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> itself is a written presentation of technical, management and operational information about the hazards and risks that may lead to a major incident at a MHF, and the control of these hazards and risks. In the <b>safety</b> <b>case,</b> the MHF operator provides justification for the measures the operator has taken to ensure the safe operation of the MHF.

We argue that through explicit capture and documentation of reusable <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> elements as patterns, the process of <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> construction and reuse can be made more systematic. For the description of patterns a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> pattern language and a graphical pattern notation (based on the Goal Structuring Notation) are presented.

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Case</b> Patterns, {{and their}} {{implementation}} using the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN), were first introduced in (ref. 1). They provide {{a mechanism for}} capturing and reusing common arguments (such as ALARP arguments) within <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> Modular <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development {{is concerned with the}} decomposition of complex <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> into well-defined separate but interlinked modules of argument and evidence. Extensions to GSN to support modular <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development were first proposed in (ref. 2). Both modular and pattern-oriented <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development approaches have been proposed as mechanisms for improving the quality of, and reducing the risks associated with, <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development for complex systems. To investigate these risks and benefits, together with gaining a better understanding of associated costs, MoD and QinetiQ (as part of the ARP project “Improved Availability and Reduced Lifecycle Costs for Military Avionics”) commissioned York to undertake a study.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> depends primarily {{on the quality of}} the reasoning embodied in the safety argument and the trustworthiness of the associated items of evidence. <b>Safety</b> <b>case</b> arguments, often depicted using graphical notations such as GSN and CAE, are typically embedded and presented in one or more documents. One of these documents is the <b>Safety</b> <b>Case</b> Report. The periodic submission of a <b>Safety</b> <b>Case</b> Report is good practice and mandated in safety standards such as UK Defence Standard 00 - 56. The relationship between the safety argument structure and the embedding report can take different forms. The <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> argument may provide an executive summary at the beginning of the report, drive the flow of the report or be attached as an appendix to the report. In this paper, we address the relationship that exists between the <b>safety</b> <b>case,</b> <b>safety</b> argument depictions and the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> report. We highlight the potential dangers of mismatch between these three entities, including the potential illusion of strong case created through the use of a structured graphical argumentation notation. We conclude that the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> is the reasoning as to how the system is acceptably safe. The depicted <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> is a representation of the argument that is hoped to mirror the actual <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Finally, the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> report can usefully provide an elaboration of the concepts referenced within the safety argument. ...|$|R

In the UK safety–critical industries <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> have been used to provide justification that systems are acceptably safe. There has been growing interest in healthcare in the application of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> for medical devices and health information technology. However, the introduction of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> into general <b>safety</b> management and regulatory practices in healthcare is largely unexplored and unsupported. Should healthcare as an industry be encouraged to adopt <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> more widely? This paper reviews <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> practices in six UK industries and identifies drivers and developments in the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> The paper argues that <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> might best be used in healthcare to provide an exposition of risk rather than as a regulatory tool to demonstrate acceptable levels of <b>safety.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>cases</b> might support healthcare organisations in establishing proactive safety management practices. However, there has been criticism that <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> practices have, at times, contributed to poor safety management and standards by prompting a “tick-box” and compliance-driven approach. These criticisms represent challenges for the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> in healthcare, where the level of maturity of safety management systems is arguably still lower than in traditional safety–critical industries.

One emerging {{way of communicating}} {{the safety of a}} complex system in a structured and comprehensive manner is using a <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>case</b> is understood as a documented body of evidence that provides a convincing and a valid argument that a system is adequately safe for a given application in a given environment. It is one option to give the safety justification the transparency and traceability required by the stakeholders.

This thesis evaluated software tools for developing a structured <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> for nuclear instrumentation and control systems justification. For tool evaluation, a set of criteria was done derived from a description of the tool usage environment in the nuclear domain. There is still unestablished terminology in the domain, so the description needed some clarification to its concepts. Main terms were nuclear <b>safety</b> <b>case,</b> <b>safety</b> demonstration and structured <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Nuclear <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> was defined as an informal overall term referring to the totality of the safety justification and management material gathered under one ‘case’. Safety demonstration was defined as the part of nuclear <b>safety</b> <b>case,</b> which contains the argumentation connecting the relevant evidence to given safety claims. Structured <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> was defined as a safety demonstration following a presentation of well-defined notation and related standards. It presents the claims, arguments and evidences required to assure the safety of the given system clearly and unambiguously. A development process for the structured <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> was outlined, from which the criteria for planning, structure, data inserting, review and management features were identified for tool evaluation.

Standards, guidance and other publications have covered in detail the structure and content of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> and this paper does not intend to repeat this information. Instead, this paper brings together and discusses the other confidence factors and approaches to managing them within the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development process. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTraceable {{documentation}} management represents a mandatory activity according to ISO 26262. This activity is also {{essential for the}} creation of an ISO 26262 -compliant <b>safety</b> <b>case,</b> which is defined as a compilation of work products. OSLC represents a promising integration framework for enabling tool interoperability and thus seamless traceability and {{documentation management}}, including <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> creation and management. In this paper, we present a step related to our work aimed at offering an OSLC-based infrastructure enabling the automatic generation of <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> fragments. Our step consists of the identification, representation and shaping of resources needed to create the <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Finally, conclusion and perspectives for future work are also drawn...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} outline a <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> {{methodology}} {{that seeks to}} minimise safety risks and commercial risks by constructing a demonstrable <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> ideas presented here were initially developed in an EU-sponsored SHIP project [1] and was then further developed in the UK Nuclear Safety Research Programme (the QUARC Project [2]). Some of these concepts have subsequently been incorporated in safety standards such as MOD Def Stan 00 - 55, and have also been used to establish specific <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> for clients. A generalisation of the concepts also appears in Def Stan 00 - 42 Part 2, {{in the form of}} the software reliability case...|$|R
40|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> should {{present a}} clear, {{comprehensive}} and defensible argument that {{a system is}} acceptably safe to operate within a particular context. However, many existing <b>safety</b> <b>cases,</b> {{in their attempt to}} manage potentially complex arguments, are poorly structured, presented and understood. This creates problems in developing and maintaining <b>safety</b> <b>cases,</b> and in capturing successful safety arguments for use on future projects. This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent approach to the development, presentation, maintenance and reuse of the safety arguments within a <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> This approach is based upon a graphical technique [...] the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) [...] and has three strands. Firstly, a method for the use of GSN is defined together with an approach to supporting incremental <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> development. Secondly, the thesis presents a systematic process for the maintenance of a GSN-structured safety argument. Thirdly, the concept of `Safety Case Patterns' is defined as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Developers of some safety {{critical}} systems construct a <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Developers changing a system during development or after release must analyse the change's {{impact on the}} <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Evidence might be invalidated by changes to the system design, operation, or environmental context. Assumptions valid in one context might be invalid elsewhere. The impact of change might not be obvious. This paper proposes a method to facilitate <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> maintenance by highlighting the impact of changes. Comment: EDCC- 2014, Fast-Abstract...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Driven {{by market}} needs and laws, {{automotive}} manufacturers develop ever more feature-rich and complex vehicles. This new functionality plays even {{an active role}} in driving, what poses many new challenges on assuring the safety of the vehicle. <b>Safety</b> <b>cases</b> constitute a proven technique to systematically use existing information about a system, its environment, and development context to show its safety. We construct the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> for a cruise control system describe in a case study in the automotive domain with a special consideration of existing domain-specific models. In the case study, we identify generic <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> modules and several reoccurring patterns, which will simplify the development of future automotive <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> Keywords-safety case; model-based development; automotive I...|$|R
