40|$|The present {{article is}} aimed at study on {{agroclimatic}} conditions of cultivation of sunflower throughout selected substations at Kurdistan Province by means of GIS system. In this investigation, meteorological data have been received from synoptic stations based on daily, monthly, and annually trend from Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO) at Kurdistan Province and then homogeneity of data has been explored by (Wald- Wolfowitz) Run Test. Methodology of the research is of statistical descriptive type. Data analysis {{was carried out by}} means of Growing Degree Day (GDD) technique and method of Deviation from Optimum Percentage (DOP) plus phenology index as well as thermal potential within environment of statistical software (EXCEL and SPSS). Under agroclimatic conditions, the results of this survey may indicate that the time period among July and September is considered as active months in terms of agriculture based on thermal potential in this region. The early days of May are the best calendar for cultivation of sunflower month in all the aforesaid substations. Time of harvesting sunflower crop is middle August for Divandareh, Dehgolan, and Saghez substations while this time is early September for Baneh substation. With respect to the phenological method, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> until budding, flowering, and the end of flowering stage and maturation start respectively sooner in Dehgolan substation than other substations in this region...|$|E

30|$|Wood {{resources}} are the lignocellulosic materials {{most widely used}} all over the world, since they are accessible and possess interesting physical, chemical and energetic properties [1, 2]. Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) is a natural resource, a complex fraction {{of the structure of}} plants, and the most abundant source of neutral carbon in the planet. It is formed by the components of the cell wall, mostly polysaccharides of the cellulose and hemicellulose, and lignin, which is a phenolic polymer [3 – 5]. The composition of LB is heterogeneous and there is little information about the organization and coordination of its main components during and after biosynthesis [6], whereas the complex physiological process is little understood [7]. The physical and chemical properties of LB differ from one plant species to another [8], as does its composition, which may vary according to the plant’s genotype, the method and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultivation,</b> its anatomic fraction, its age or growth stage, and the storage techniques [3, 4, 9, 10]. It has also been reported that some components of LB may change as response to biotic or abiotic stress [5].|$|R

It can be determined the climatic potential conditions in the various regions and utilize them {{to a large extent}} by investigating in agro-meteorology. In this research, it has been applied the Geographic Information System to generate the climatic potential maps for Zanjan Province. To this purpose, the 30 -year statistical records of climatology and synoptic stations have been used in the province of Zanjan. It was determined the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> for each section of the province after obtaining the beginning <b>date</b> <b>of</b> autumn precipitations for each part of the province.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the nematofauna was studied in four soils that differed in length of fallow restoration period since previous cultivation. The longest fallow period was 21 years. Plots were sampled for 2 years after starting <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> the fallow soils. The treatments were ranked following a restoration-exploitation gradient depending on fallow duration {{and the number of}} years <b>of</b> millet <b>cultivation</b> after fallow clearing; components of the nematofauna were analysed for correlation with this ranking. The nematode community structures at the first <b>date</b> <b>of</b> sampling during <b>cultivation</b> clearly reflected the length of the fallow period. Nematode community structures in the fallow soils rapidly approached those in the continuously cultivated soil; they were hardly distinguishable during the second year <b>of</b> <b>cultivation.</b> One-third <b>of</b> the recorded nematode taxa exhibited pronounced responses to the cultivation. Mononchidae, Anatonchidae, Tylencholaimoidea, #Acrobeles$, #Pseudacrobeles$, Tylenchidae and #Helicotylenchus$ preferred sites of more mature successional status, while Dorylaimoidea, #Tylenchorhynchus$ and Rhabdolaimidae dominated the cultivated sites. The maturity index (MI) did not distinguish the management regimes. The plant parasite index (PPI) tended to decrease with higher restoration status linked to greater abundance of the Tylenchidae in these situations. The decrease of fungal to bacterial feeders reflected a decreasing importance of the fungal decomposition pathway after resuming cultivation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that date growing {{as a commercial}} fruit export stopped {{at the end of}} 70 AD, when the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans. However, study of contemporary sources indicates that the date industry continued in Judea throughout the Roman period and that, indeed, the Roman Imperial treasury collected {{a good deal of the}} profits. Asaph Goor, in his 21-page article History <b>of</b> the <b>Date</b> through the Ages in the Holy Land, never mentions any such Roman devastation <b>of</b> the <b>date</b> palms, but rather cites numerous contemporary accounts attesting to the continuing extent <b>of</b> <b>date</b> <b>cultivation</b> through the Roman period. Goor only detects a decline in date cultivation through the period of Arab rule and especially during the Crusades, when he notes that the devastation of the region was particularly hard on the palm plantations. However, despite this, extensive cultivation persisted in Jericho and Zoara, until the agrarian economy collapsed around the 14th century. Goor attributes this final decline to a change in the climate, and quotes several later travelers to the area as to the rarity <b>of</b> <b>date</b> palms, including Pierre Belon, who in 1553 scoffed at the idea that the region could have ever produced the bounty <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> reported in ancient sources.|$|R

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to simulate weed emergence patterns after soil cultivation. In the model, the consecutive processes of dormancy release, germination and pre-emergence growth were modelled in separate modules. Input variables of the model were: <b>date</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>cultivation,</b> soil temperature and soil penetration resistance. Output variables of the model were: seedling density and timing of seedling emergence. The model was parameterized for Polygonum persicaria, Chenopodium album and Spergula arvensis with data from previous field and laboratory experiments. The model was evaluated with data from an experiment, in which emergence of P. persicaria, C. album and S. arvensis was monitored in field plots that were cultivated once only, at one <b>of</b> five <b>dates</b> in the spring. At {{the same time as}} the field observations on seedling emergence, seasonal changes in seed dormancy of the buried weed seeds were assessed by testing the germination of seed lots that were buried in envelopes. From a comparison between field observations and simulated data, it appeared that the model overestimated the rate of dormancy release in spring, whereas germination and pre-emergence growth were simulated well. In general, therefore, both the numbers of emerging seedlings and the timing of emergence could be predicted accurately, when dormancy was not simulated but introduced from experimental data. Improvement of predictions of field emergence of weeds should mainly focus on increasing the precision of the simulation of dormancy release. Close correlations were found between seedbed temperature and both the extent and rate of seedling emergence, but analysis with the simulation model revealed that they were only partly based on causal relationships, so that they have limited predictive value...|$|R

The selling price is lowered according to storage time, both on the plot and in the cold room. We force the unsold products left on the plots (losses) to be harvested before a management practice dependent deadline, to limit diseases and insects proliferation. Considering short time perishability (a few days) make us work on a tow-day step.
