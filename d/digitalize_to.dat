40|$|Digital {{computers}} are powerful tools for studying natural phenomena at large-scales. Nevertheless, custom-made methods {{have to be}} developed <b>to</b> <b>digitalize,</b> simulate and finally visualize these phenomena. First, the numerous data of the real-world have <b>to</b> be <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> be stored into a computer. Then, as dynamics of large-scale natural phenomena are usually not obvious to understand, computation-based simulation models have to be developed. Finally, Virtual Reality (VR) techniques are better than 3 D visualization on conventional computer graphic displays to observe and manipulate real and large-scale data, to compare them with simulation ones. Consequently, in a first interdisciplinary effort, we present some new solutions to design a VR platform for the analysis and simulation of largescale phenomena. Original digitalization and visualization techniques (in an immersive environment) constitute the main contribution of this paper...|$|R

40|$|Associative classification, which {{originates}} from {{numerical data}} mining, {{has been applied}} to deal with text data recently. Text data is firstly <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> database of transactions, and then training and prediction is actually conducted on the derived numerical dataset. This intuitive strategy has demonstrated quite good performance. However, it doesn't take into consideration the inherent characteristics of text data as much as possible, although it has to deal with some specific problems of text data such as lemmatizing and stemming during digitalization. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up strategy to adapt associative classification to text categorization, in which we take into account structure information of text. Experiments on Reuters- 21578 dataset show that the proposed strategy can make use of text structure information and achieve better performance...|$|R

The Lomada Norte is located in the northwestern triangle of Corrientes province (Argentina). It holds an area of about 5 km wide and 80 km long, having 925 lentic bodies of water, either temporary or permanent. The aim of this work is to explain the geomorphologic processes involved in the study area using tools for spatial analysis. All water bodies were <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> generate a digital elevation model of the region (DEM). For the spatial analysis, the expansion Spatial Analyst Tools Hydrology from ArcGis 10 was used. As a result, a diagram showing the runoff system on Lomada Norte was generated that coincides with the erosion processes observed on satelital images. The analysis performed evidenced the convenience of using this tool for the spatial analysis of low-altitude areas suggest. All these results suggest that the geomorphologic dynamic of the Lomada Norte responds to topographic conditions. Pages: 5591 - 559...|$|R
40|$|The {{speed of}} a quantum random number {{generator}} is essential for practical applications, such as high-speed quantum key distribution systems. Here, we push the {{speed of a}} quantum random number generator to 68 Gbps by operating a laser around its threshold level. To achieve the rate, not only high-speed photodetector and high sampling rate are needed, but also a very stable interferometer is required. A practical interferometer with active feedback instead of common temperature control is developed to meet requirement of stability. Phase fluctuations of the laser are measured by the interferometer with a photodetector, and then <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> raw random numbers with a rate of 80 Gbps. The min-entropy of the raw data is evaluated by modeling the system and is used to quantify the quantum randomness of the raw data. The bias of the raw data caused by other signals, such as classical and detection noises, can be removed by Toeplitz-matrix hashing randomness extraction. The final random numbers can pass through the standard randomness tests. Our demonstration shows that high-speed quantum random number generators are ready for practical usage.

40|$|Music {{has had an}} {{important}} role in human life from time immemorial. Music has been shared in two ways aurally and as written documents known as musical notes or musical scores. Many ancient cultures have used musical symbols to represent melodies and lyrics but none of them is as comprehensive as a written language or document. Thus the knowledge of ancient music is limited to a few fragments which are mostly unpublished. Hence to preserve such music we need to introduce a computerized system <b>to</b> <b>digitalize</b> and <b>to</b> decode the musical symbol images and reconstruct it as new score which will be in machine readable format. Here the machine readable format is MIDI. Prior to converting the musical symbols into MIDI format, musical sheets need to be segmented for isolating the musical symbols. Since synthetically generated musical sheets are used here, the segmentation process can be carried out using recursive graph cut method. Here we discuss the initial few steps such as staff line removal, text removal and segmentation of musical sheet...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare through digital morphometry, the intimal {{thickening}} of {{the common}} ilíac arteries (CIA) in pigs, submitted to angioplasty and angioplasty followed by stent implantation. METHODS: Angioplasty was performed in 10 pigs in both CIA, followed by a stent implantation in the left CIA. After four weeks, the aorto-iliac segment was dissected. Histologic slices where divided in three groups: left CIA {{in the area of}} the proximal (group 1) and distal (group 2) implantation site of the stent and the region of angioplasty in the right CIA (group 3). The histological slices were <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> be analyzed by morphometry with calculation of the luminal, intimal and media layers areas. Descriptive statistics analysis was performed through average and standard deviation of areas on each group, using ANOVA, with LSD Post-Hoc test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: A significant statistic difference was observed when the median area of intimal layer of the groups 1 and 2 where compared with group 3 and in the media layer area of the groups 1 and 2 when compared with group 3. No difference was observed in luminal areas among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Angioplasty followed by stent insertion produces an intimal thickening larger than that observed after simple angioplasty. However, the area of the media layer is smaller in the "angioplasty plus stent" group and there is no significant change in the luminal area among the three groups...|$|R
40|$|Biomechanical {{studies of}} wound {{strength}} are impor-tant because of new investigations in growth factors, cytokines, and fetal wounds. We compared two tradi-tional methods of wound disruption measurement {{with a novel}} computerized model designed for in uivo exper-iments. An Instron tensiometer (INSTS) and an air in-sufflated positive pressure device (AIPPD) were com-pared with a vacuum-controlled wound chamber de-vice (VCWCD). The VCWCD produced vacuum at the wound site and wound disruption was monitored with two video camera/recorders. Rats were marked with a template guide for a 2. 5 cm, full-thickness, abdominal incisional wound. Rats were divided into three groups and studied at 2, 7, or I 4 days after wounding. The recorded images were computer <b>digitalized</b> <b>to</b> generate wound strength curves from a three-dimensional model. A comparison of the wound disruption curves demonstrated that the VCWCD was comparable to the INST or AIPPD in normal wound healing (P 1. 40). The VCWCD provided data with less standard error at 2 days after wounding (P < 05). In separate series of experiments, VCWCD was tested in the early phases of healing and {{was found to be}} sensitive to change at in-tervals of 48 hr after wounding (P <. 005). The INST or AIPPD methods could not perform this task because of an unacceptable level of random error after tissue manipulation. The VCWCD system was considered su-perior for evaluating early wound healing because it was an in duo method which required minimal wound manipulation. 0 1992 Academic Press. Inc...|$|R

The study was performed on a series of up to 7000 digital chest X-ray examinations and a sample of 173 cases was {{selected on the basis of}} particular diseases and pathologic patterns. In the latter case, digital and conventional radiographic techniques were compared. According to this analysis, the digital system was slightly superior in detecting anatomical details, small pleural effusions (3 cases) and slight low-contrast interstitial pathologic changes, mainly in apical (12 cases) and retrocardiac (19 cases) lung areas. The conventional screen-film system better showed small hilar calcifications (2 cases). From the protection viewpoint, at equivalent entrance doses,. 15 -. 26 Gy/cm 2 of dose-area product (DAP) values were reported with the digital system, using a tension of 150 kV in orthogonal projections, which are considerably lower than. 25 -. 70 Gy/cm 2 measured with the conventional technique. Moreover, Thoravision permitted to perform up to 100 exposures/hour, using a phantom, and 15 - 20 digital chest examinations/hour, versus the average 12 - 15 with the conventional screen-film system. The initial results are very encouraging from the clinical and cost-effectiveness viewpoints, thanks to higher Thoravision productivity and to exam optimization, even though wider and prolonged experience plus a careful study of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in each group of chest conditions is advisable, to assess the real innovative impact of this digital chest imaging system...|$|R
