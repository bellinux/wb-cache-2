5|$|The JCR runs three balls {{every year}} for its students, with one held during each term. The largest {{is the end of}} year June Ball, which is the social {{highlight}} of the academic year.

5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{monitored}} by 132 sensors, including sensors on hatches to the pontoons, on <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> steel box girder, for corrosion, strain gauges on the girder and on flexible elements, and weather information. On the cable-stayed section, {{the bridge is}} marked with navigation lights, {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{originally}} constructed of flint with stone dressings, but was substantially refaced with knapped flint in the 1880s; the tower was restored {{at the same}} time. A wall was built behind the altar in 1886 to create a separate sacristy for storing vestments and other items. The west tower was restored again in 1989, and the current <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sacristy were added in the same year.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
5|$|Råsunda Stadium was {{revealed}} {{as the official}} venue of the final in December 1997. Located in Solna, Stockholm, the stadium opened its <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in 1937, and {{was used by the}} Sweden national team for their games in the 1958 FIFA World Cup, including the final, as well as most of their general ties. Råsunda also held four of the national team's fixtures, in the 1992 European Championship, and the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final; it was also the home base of AIK's matches, until demolishment plans began in 2012. For the final, Råsunda had a capacity of generally 35,000.|$|E

5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{building}} is occupied by the , 150 seat Great Hall, where the National Assembly convenes. Formerly rectangular, it was renovated into an amphitheater in 2000. Each seat has a microphone, an automatic voting system, plug socket {{and access to the}} National Assembly's computer network. The chair facing the <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall is for the President of the National Assembly. Behind it, a bronze relief of the coat of arms of Slovenia is positioned on the marble wall. The sculptor Marko Pogačnik created the work in 1991 to celebrate independence. There is also a 106-seat gallery for the public and guests to view the Great Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} throne hall is the small porch, {{projecting}} out {{at the front of}} the building. Under this porch stands the Busabok Mala Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the larger building itself. The high base of the throne is surrounded by praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, the throne was used when the king appeared before his vassal states; later it was used for certain ceremonies. The two <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall is situated at the sides of the throne.|$|E

5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square {{was packed with}} sightseers and fans and police were unable to control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found the <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify {{the findings of the}} contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E

5|$|Several props {{and effects}} {{seen in the}} episode were {{reproduced}} from the Star Trek movies, including the shots of Earth and Spacedock One and the painting used of Starfleet Command. The <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room where dinner is served were later reused from season 2 onwards on the set for Ten-Forward. The episode also features two first appearances; the Ambassador class starship was mentioned {{for the first time}} (the Horatio was a member of this class, as was the Enterprise-C) and it also marks {{the first time that a}} Bolian had been seen on Star Trek, the species having been named after the episode's director. Although the parasites never appeared again on screen in any Star Trek series, they reappear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels, where they are revealed to be mutated Trill symbiotes.|$|E
5|$|The Norman invaders of the 11th century {{took the}} city without resistance, {{and by the}} 12th century the walls were ill-maintained and of little {{military}} value. Fears of a French invasion during the Hundred Years' War led to an enquiry into Canterbury's defences in 1363. The decision was taken to restore the city walls and for around the next thirty years the old Roman defences were freshly rebuilt in stone, incorporating the older walls where they still remained. 24 towers were constructed around the circuit, and over the coming years many of the gatehouses were rebuilt in stone and brick, defended {{by some of the}} first batteries of guns in England. Parts of the wall were deliberately damaged by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 17th century and the <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's gates burnt; with the restoration of Charles II in 1660, new doors were reinstalled.|$|E
5|$|The usurpation, {{which began}} in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271–272 in Byzantium, and {{probably}} crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up some resistance before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed {{by the rest of}} Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria—which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.|$|E
