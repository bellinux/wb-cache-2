5|$|The conifer and mixed-forests of {{the park}} and its {{surroundings}} provide habitats for northern saw-whet owl, blue-headed vireo, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> dark-eyed junco, and magnolia, pine, yellow-rumped, Blackburnian, and black-throated green warblers. The deciduous forests provide habitats for songbirds, such as scarlet tanager and red-eyed vireo.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} known {{case of fraud}} {{involving}} a record submitted to BBRC has become public. In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, claimed to have recorded a <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> in a garden in Chipping Ongar. Doubts about the record were raised in Birdwatch and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it should stand. In 2009, Pepper revealed in Birdwatch magazine (Birdwatch 204: 46-47) that the record was a deception, made in protest at perceived secrecy surrounding rare birds in the county.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} bird species also inhabit the area near Negro Hollow. These include American robins, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrushes,</b> Cooper's hawks, winter wrens, and pileated woodpeckers. American robins are {{especially}} common near the stream.|$|R
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{written in}} free verse in 206 lines, uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with the pastoral elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E
25|$|These {{mountains}} and plateau have over 20 species of reptiles represented as lizard, skink, turtle and snake. Some of the icterid birds visit the mountains {{as well as}} the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> and wood thrush. North American migrant birds live throughout the mountains during the warmer seasons. Occasionally, osprey and eagles can be found nesting along the streams. The hawks and owls are the most common birds of prey.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hermit</b> <b>thrushes</b> {{breed in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed woods across Canada, southern Alaska, and the northeastern and western United States. They make a cup nest {{on the ground}} or relatively low in a tree.|$|R
50|$|They are {{visited by}} butterflies, {{and have a}} mild, hawthorn-like scent. The fruit are {{consumed}} by birds, including mockingbirds, American robins, cedar waxwings and <b>hermit</b> <b>thrushes.</b> Mammals including coyotes and bears also eat and disperse the pomes.|$|R
50|$|Birdwatchers {{will find}} varied <b>thrushes</b> and <b>hermit</b> <b>thrushes</b> {{in the dense}} timber around the guard station. Nuthatches, chickadees, and Steller's jays are common. There are also pileated {{woodpeckers}} in the surrounding forest, {{but they can be}} hard to spot.|$|R
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 {{a team of}} {{researchers}} from the San Diego Natural History Museum completed a five-year survey of the Grinnell Transect, Grinnell's 1908 study of the flora and fauna of Mount San Jacinto. In 60 surveys across 20 sites, they found the forest to be much denser than in Grinnell's time, with the loss of three species including a flying squirrel, and an increase in birds that like thick brush, such as the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> the brown creeper and the Townsend's solitaire. The relative lack of leaf litter and decayed ground cover in Grinnell's time was considered to make the occurrence of hot and lasting fires in the forest impossible. With a much thicker understory in 2013, the team {{of researchers}} were forced by the Mountain Fire to evacuate their camp.|$|E
500|$|According to Reynolds, Whitman's first-person narrator {{describes}} himself as [...] "me powerless-O helpless soul of me" [...] and identifies with the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> a [...] "'shy and hidden bird' singing of death with a [...] "bleeding throat'". The <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> {{is seen as an}} intentional alter ego for Whitman, and its song as the [...] "source of the poet's insight". Miller writes that [...] "The <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> is an American bird, and Whitman made it his own in his Lincoln elegy. We might even take the 'dry grass singing' as an oblique allusion to Leaves of Grass".|$|E

500|$|Scholar James Edwin Miller {{states that}} [...] "Whitman's <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> becomes {{the source of}} his {{reconciliation}} to Lincoln's death, to all death, as the [...] "strong deliveress" [...] Killingsworth writes that [...] "the poet retreats to the swamp to mourn the death of the beloved president to the strains of the solitary <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> singing in the dark pines...the sacred places resonate with the mood of the poet, they offer renewal and revived inspiration, they return him to the rhythms of the earth with tides" [...] and replaces the sense of time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Whitman's friend, John Burroughs (1837–1921), an {{aspiring}} nature writer, had returned to Washington to his position at the Treasury department after a long vacation in the woods. Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what I tell him of the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> {{and he says he}} largely used the information I have given him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E
500|$|Whitman's poem {{features}} three prominent motifs or images—the lilacs, {{a western}} star (Venus), and the hermit thrush—referred to as a [...] "trinity". Biographer David S.

500|$|Miller {{observes that}} if [...] "we follow {{out all the}} {{implications}} of Eliot's evocation of Whitman's [...] "Lilacs" [...] at this critical moment in The Waste Land we might assume it has its origins, too, in a death, in a death deeply felt, {{the death of a}} beloved friend"..."But unlike the Whitman poem, Eliot's Waste Land has no retreat on the 'shores of the water,' no <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> to sing its joyful carol of death." [...] He further adds that [...] "It seems unlikely that Eliot's long poem, in the form in which it was first conceived and written, would have been possible without the precedence of Whitman's own experiments in similar forms." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{believe that}} T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) drew from Whitman's elegy in {{fashioning}} his poem The Waste Land (1922). In the poem, Eliot prominently mentions lilacs and April in its opening lines, and later passages about [...] "dry grass singing" [...] and [...] "where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees." [...] Eliot told author Ford Madox Ford that Whitman {{and his own}} lines adorned by lilacs and the <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> were the poems' only [...] "good lines" [...] Cleo McNelly Kearns writes that [...] "Whitman's poem gives us not only motifs and images of The Waste Land...but its very tone and pace, the steady andante which makes of both poems a walking meditation." ...|$|E
500|$|Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are {{adapted to}} the {{environment}} of the High Desert. [...] Pronghorn are common in the open, sagebrush-covered basins, while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves. [...] There are also bighorn sheep, cougars, and bobcats in the high country. [...] Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range. Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the Great Basin. Some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher, mountain cottontail, and Belding's ground squirrel. North American beavers live in and along streams, as do Pacific tree frogs, western spadefoot toads, and garter snakes. Native bird species include the sage grouse, mountain chickadee, gray-headed junco, black-throated gray warbler, Virginia's warbler, MacGillivray's warbler, pine siskin, red crossbill, bushtit, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> northern goshawk, and species of raven and eagle.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a typical}} New World thrush genus, {{although}} representatives of other genera, such as the true thrushes (Turdus) also occur in the region, especially in Central and South America.

500|$|As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's {{forests are}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species" [...] and are home to 102species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush,</b> house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.|$|E
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush {{are found in the}} lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush</b> at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean. Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of [...] Nashville and yellow-rumped warblers, yellow-bellied sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, and purple finch.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hermit</b> <b>thrush's</b> song {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the finest sound in nature" [...] and is ethereal and flute-like, consisting of a beginning note, then several descending musical phrases in a minor key, repeated at different pitches.

40|$|Fatty acids are {{the primary}} fuel for flight, and play {{important}} roles in multiple physiological processes of birds. Birds prefer to eat certain fatty acids over others and these preferences {{may be related to}} how efficiently and rapidly certain fatty acids are used as well as the production of reactive oxygen species during fatty acid metabolism. We tested the hypotheses that (1) songbirds prefer certain amounts and ratios of fatty acids, and (2) these fatty acid preferences of songbirds are affected by availability of dietary antioxidants. During fall and spring seasons, we offered European starlings (Sturnis vulgaris) and <b>hermit</b> <b>thrushes</b> (Catharus guttatus), respectively, choices of semi-synthetic diets that mainly differed in three fatty acids (18 : 1, 18 : 2, 18 : 3) and in antioxidant level (low or high vitamin E). We also determined the fatty acid composition of fruits that are commonly eaten by songbirds during migration along the Atlantic coast of New England. We found that starlings increased their consumption of 18 : 2 and 18 : 1 when given diets with a higher level of vitamin E compared to diets with a low level of vitamin E. <b>Hermit</b> <b>thrushes</b> consistently consumed a 1 : 2 ratio of both 18 : 2 to 18 : 1 and 18 : 2 to 18 : 3 regardless of vitamin E level, and increased consumption of 18 : 1 when given diets with more vitamin E. We also estimated that <b>hermit</b> <b>thrushes</b> can achieve their preferred ratio of 18 : 2 to 18 : 1 in nature by eating a certain combination of wild fruits that are available at stopover sites during migration in southern New England. Our results indicate that birds prefer diets with certain ratios of fatty acids and these preferences change with seasonal physiological needs and dietary antioxidant level. Our findings have important ecological and conservation implications especially concerning the importance of Northern Arrowwood (Viburnum recognitum) in a bird 2 ̆ 7 s diet. ...|$|R
