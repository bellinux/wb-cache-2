60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> curious pattering {{upon the}} door, almost like some one {{feeling for the}} handle in the dark, and Pyecraft's {{familiar}} grunts.|$|E
60|$|Our enemies were disputing {{not far off}} {{upon the}} deck, and that so loudly that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> word or two above the washing of the seas.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{few more}} of those {{remarkable}} sentiments of yours, concerning the stake we should all have in society, I think it would relieve my mind." ...|$|E
5000|$|The unusual {{title of}} the album came from a dream that Linkous had - he {{described}} it as being [...] "about General Lee having a crude submarine back in the Civil War, and the dream <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> old-time band playing inside, all distorted by the water".|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> myself <b>a</b> mile away," [...] {{the trooper}} said. [...] "Still, that horse of yours is making row {{enough for a}} squadron." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He be d----d," [...] muttered the plain-speaking Injin, {{as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him. <b>As</b> soon as {{released}} from his presence, Streak o' Lightning continued his examination, though a little vexed at the undramatical character of the interruption.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> gown-skirt {{rustling}} [...] Before I {{could see}} her shape, Rustling through the heather [...] That wove the common's drape, On that evening of dark weather [...] When I hearkened, lips agape.|$|E
60|$|A {{murmur of}} applause {{followed}} this notable proposal, and I fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> snigger {{from the young}} man, as if he found the project to his mind, and {{thought it might be}} feasible.|$|E
6000|$|I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{brighter}} {{account of}} yourself; but I am inclined to acquit the Admiral {{of having a}} share in the responsibility. My very heavy cold is, I hope, drawing off; and the change to this charming house in the forest will, I hope, complete my re-establishment.--With love to all, believe me, your ever affectionate ...|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} stroll up and down. The night was wonderfully still. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> {{somebody}} {{walking up the}} drive--one of the maids, I supposed, returning from her evening out. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> bird rustling in the ivy {{on the walls of}} the stables.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think either}} {{of them will be}} much good," [...] she »aid; [...] "I can see the white water but nothing else, and I am sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> naked {{footstep}} on the rocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I loathe the mincing French and the fat Flemish tongues," [...] he owned, when Master Lambert {{was out of}} hearing. [...] "I {{should feel}} at home if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> honest carter shout 'Woa' to his horses." ...|$|R
60|$|I did so; {{and became}} at once {{conscious}} {{of an extraordinary}} throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In {{the silence of the}} room <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.|$|E
60|$|The rain {{seemed to}} be pouring on its roof and {{northern}} side {{as if there were}} a waterfall above us, {{and every now and then}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> shower of hailstones rattling against the shutters. My bedroom was one of the rooms on the lower floor, and even there I could hear the pounding of the deluge and the hailstones upon the roof.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No. Not {{that day}} or the next, but {{on the third day}} Mary and I both thought we heard a funny sound. I said that Mr. Skinner had left his window open, and it was the blind {{flapping}} against the window-pane; but when we heard that funny noise again I put my ear to the keyhole and I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> groan. I was very frightened, and sent Mary for the police.' ...|$|E
60|$|On we went, the sky {{blackening}} around us, and {{the wind}} beginning to pipe such a wild and melancholy tune as best suited the hollow sounds of the advancing tide, which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> at <b>a</b> distance, like the roar of some immense monster defrauded of its prey.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> such <b>a</b> {{statement}} from you without some surprise. Whatever you do I hope {{will tend to}} make you happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well worth it, Lionel. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{little of}} what was said, but that was quite enough {{to show that a}} plot is on foot to attack and kill the queen the next time she {{journeys}} to Windsor. The conspirators are to hide in a wood near Datchet." ...|$|R
60|$|They were evidently {{talking of}} me, for {{every now and}} then they looked at me, and {{some of the people who}} were sitting on the bench outside the door--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my {{polyglot}} dictionary from my bag and looked them out.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} noises almost {{like those in}} an engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the {{aperture}} in the wall I could see {{the top of a}} tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} stroke of twelve, the {{cupboard}} {{door in the}} next room opened. There is no need to ask me how I knew it. I couldn't, of course, see it, but I could hear, or sense in some way, the sound of it. I could feel my hair, all of it, rising upon my head. I was aware that there was a presence in the adjoining room, I will not say a person, a living soul, but a presence. Anyone who has been {{in the next room}} to a presence will know just how I felt. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> sound as of some one groping on the floor and the faint rattle as of coins.|$|E
60|$|Dear Mr. Chorley, Robert and I {{have had}} true {{pleasure}} (in {{spite of all}} this fault-finding) in feeling ourselves close to you in your book. Volume after volume we have exchanged, talking of you, praising you here, blaming you there, but always feeling pleasure in reading your words and speaking your name. Don't say it's the last novel. You, who can do so much. Write us another at once rather, doing justice to our sublime Azeglios and acute Cavours and energetic Farinis. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> English statesman (Conservative or Liberal) speak out of a large heart and generous comprehension as I did Azeglio this last spring, I should thank God for it. I fear I never shall. My boy may, perhaps. Red tape has garrotted this political generation....|$|R
500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was <b>a</b> cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>hear</b> myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{biography}} of Pupols, Viktors Pupols, American Master, {{was written by}} Larry Parr and published by Thinkers' Press in 1983. Viktors describes his encounters with young Grandmaster-to-be Yasser Seirawan: [...] "I could not even see my opponent. All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was <b>a</b> voice calling {{out from under the}} table - Check!!". A poem was written in this book describing Viktors' arch rival James Harley McCormick: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} no escape, as we lived, from being beset. We had all to attend the Queen to the Litanies at the chapel. She used to remain in her little orator praying long after they were finished, Mademoiselle with her, and, by her own account, {{generally}} asleep. I am ashamed {{to say how much}} chatter, and how many petits soins, went on among those waiting outside. I used to kneel, as I heard people say, like a grim statue over my chair, with my rosary hanging from my hands, for if I did but hear a rustle and turn my head, there stood M. de Lamont with a bonbonniere, or an offer to shield me from the draught, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> tittering behind me.|$|E
60|$|I slept {{little and}} ill. Long ere it was day, I had slipped from beside my bedfellow, and was warming {{myself at the}} fire or walking to and fro before the door. Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little after sprang up a wind out of the west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun, and set the mill to the turning. There was {{something}} of spring in the sunshine, or else {{it was in my}} heart; and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind the hill diverted me extremely. At times <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> creak of the machinery; and by half-past eight of the day Catriona began to sing in the house. At this I would have cast my hat in the air; and I thought this dreary, desert place was like a paradise.|$|E
60|$|It was a sultry day, {{and the sun}} was exercising {{his power}} over the whole ice field. I sat down by a great ice block, about fifty feet long, to {{interrogate}} it, and see what I could make of it, by a cool, confidential proximity and examination. The ice was porous and spongy, as I have seen it on the shores of the Connecticut, when beginning to thaw out under the influence of a spring sun. I could see the little drops of water percolating in a thousand tiny streams through it, and dropping down on every side. Putting my ear to it, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> fine musical trill and trickle, and that still small click and stir, as of melting ice, which showed that it was surely and gradually giving way, and flowing back again.|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} one of these periods of dense gloom that Ayesha must have arrived upon the review ground. At least, when it lifted, there {{she was in her}} white garments, {{surrounded}} by women and guards, engaged apparently in making an oration, for although <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> word, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see by the motions of her arms that she was speaking.|$|R
60|$|How shall I {{ever forget}} that dreadful vigil? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> sound, {{not even the}} drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my {{companion}} sat open-eyed, within {{a few feet of}} me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} quiet and {{pleasant}} on the piazza, but, although <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>a</b> great deal of talking was going on inside, no words came to me. In a short time, however, a man-servant in livery came out upon the piazza and approached me with a tray on which were {{a cup of coffee}} and some cigars. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not refrain from smiling as I saw the man.|$|R
60|$|There was lively work in {{the next}} few seconds. The shots were thick and fast--and uncommonly loud; none, I think, from our side. Cobb was on the extreme left of our advance, I on the right--about two paces apart. He {{instantly}} dived into the wood. The three men and I climbed across the fence somehow and struck out across the field--actuated, doubtless, by an intelligent forethought: men on horseback could not immediately follow. Passing near the house, now swarming like a hive of bees, we made for a swamp two or three hundred yards away, where I concealed myself in a jungle, the others continuing--as a defeated commander would put it--to fall back. In my cover, where I lay panting like a hare, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> deal of shouting and hard riding and an occasional shot. I heard some one calling dogs, and the thought of bloodhounds added its fine suggestiveness to the other fancies appropriate to the occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Having {{deposited}} {{the packages}} upon the sands, {{we sat down}} beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean {{in the hope of}} perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, {{on the edge of the}} horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.|$|E
60|$|And yet it {{was destined}} that ere ever I reached this quiet harbour I should learn that I was still one of humankind, {{and that it is}} an ill thing to strive to break the bond which binds us to our fellows. It was but two nights before the date I had fixed upon for my change of dwelling, when I was {{conscious}} of a bustle in the house beneath, with the bearing of heavy burdens up the creaking stair, and the harsh voice of my landlady, loud in welcome and protestations of joy. From time to time, amid the whirl of words, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> gentle and softly modulated voice, which struck pleasantly upon my ear after the long weeks during which I had listened only to the rude dialect of the dalesmen. For an hour I could hear the dialogue beneath--the high voice and the low, with clatter of cup and clink of spoon, until at last a light, quick step passed my study door, and I knew that my new fellow lodger had sought her room.|$|E
60|$|For a long time, though I {{certainly}} {{did my best}} to listen, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing but <b>a</b> low gabbling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.|$|R
60|$|As the man {{departed}} unwillingly enough {{upon this}} errand, we made so bold as {{to follow him}} to the antechamber, whence <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> for <b>a</b> while the murmuring of several voices in the room within. The truth is, they were three at the one table--Prestongrange, Simon Fraser, and Mr. Erskine, Sheriff of Perth; and as they were met in consultation on the very business of the Appin murder, {{they were a little}} disturbed at my appearance, but decided to receive me.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not heard}} a silence before in years. It was absolute. I raised myself on my elbow and listened to it. Sleep! I thought that if <b>I</b> only <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself <b>I</b> <b>could</b> compose myself to rest. I thought once that I heard a sound like the sail of a catboat {{flapping}} as it veered about in a breeze, but I {{decided that it was}} probably only a tack in the carpet. Still I listened.|$|R
