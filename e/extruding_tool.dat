The ESTC is a very highly mineral-filled resin system formed into a 6 mm thick sheet. The sheet is laid on the pattern, vacuum (bag) is applied to remove air from the pattern surface, and the assembly is heat cured. The formed ESTC is then backed and/or framed and ready for use. The cured ESTC exhibits low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and maintains strength at temperatures of 180 to 200 C.

Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow. The anisotropic nature of the material which partly determines the stagnation region also influences the side flow due to the different deformation mechanism under the action of the tool edge. At different cutting directions, the size of the side flow has a great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality. The cutting directions of { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 >, { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, and { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 - 10 [*]>[*]are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality with small side flow. Besides that, the side flow could be suppressed by reducing the feed and optimizing the cutting tool geometry. Cutting tool with small edge radius, large positive rake angle, and inclination angle would decrease the side flow and consequently improve the machined surface quality.|$|R
40|$|Scroll {{shoulder}} {{tools are}} widely used {{and they do not}} need to be tilted during friction stir welding (FSW). However, the detailed material flow, which is important for proper scroll shoulder tool design and subsequently for forming the defect-free shoulder flow zone, has not been fully explained. In the present study, features of material flow in shoulder flow zone, during FSW of thick 6061 aluminium (Al) plates using a scroll shoulder tool were investigated. It was observed that there is a simple layer-to-layer banded structure which appears in the bottom portion of shoulder flow zone, but disappears in the top portion of this weld zone. When the scroll shoulder tool is plunged into the workpiece to a determined depth, the workpiece material is <b>extruded</b> by the <b>tool</b> pin, and pushed up into the scroll groove beneath the shoulder forming the pick-up material. During the forward movement of the tool, the central portion of pick-up material was driven downward by the root portion of pin and then it detaches from the tip portion of pin in a layer-to-layer manner to form the weld...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) method {{that relies on}} the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual <b>extruded</b> layers using <b>tool</b> paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} campaign aimed at the study of the microstructure of Friction Stir Welded butt joints. In this solid-state welding technology, a rotating tool moves into the material and translates along the interface of two or more parts. During this process friction heats the material which is <b>extruded</b> around the <b>tool</b> and forged by the large pressure produced by the tool shoulder. The experimental campaign was performed by means of a CNC machine tool. Butt joints were obtained on sheets having a thickness equal to 8 mm. An AA 6060 aluminum alloy in the T 6 artificially aged condition was used for this purpose. Sheets were welded by using a standard tool with smooth plane shoulder and cylindrical pin. The tool was fabricated using AISI 1040 steel, shoulder and pin diameters are respectively equal to 20 and 8 mm. The tilt angle, was fixed at 2. 5 Â° and the pin was inserted into the workpiece for 7. 8 mm. The joints were executed by varying the process parameters, namely rotational speed (S [rev/min]) and feed rate (f [mm/min]). The selection of the parameter values was based on a DOE (Design of Experiments) approach. The metallurgical analysis was carried out to evaluate the microstructure of the joints transverse section {{as a function of the}} process parameters and to evaluate the grain size in the different regions of the joints: Nugget, HAZ - Heat Affected Zone, TMAZ - Thermo Mechanical Affected Zone. The grain count was executed according to the standard ASTM E 112 - 96 (2004). The ratio between feed rate and rotational speed resulted to be a significant parameter for the control of the joints grain size. The Nugget showed a microstructure with very small grains with an average dimension equal to one third with respect to the grains of the base material. The grain size linearly decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. The TMAZ is characterized by strongly elongated grains, oriented in a different way with respect to the ones of the other regions. Also in this case, an almost linear correlation between grain size and f/S ratio was observed. On the opposite, in the HAZ, the grain size decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. A tensile test campaign was also carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of the joints. Specimens having a width and a thickness equal respectively to 18 mm and 8 mm were tested orthogonally with respect to the welding direction by means of a Galdabini machine. Except for the joints containing defects, the rupture always occurred in the HAZ. The increase of UTS was observed for increasing values of the ratio between feed rate and rotational speed (f/S). An inverse behaviour was observed for the strain at rupture. Finally, the quality of the joins, in terms of tensile strength, was compared with the metallurgical properties observed on the joints. The tensile strength resulted to increase for decreasing values of the grain size...|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is an {{emerging}} solid state welding process. It {{has been a}} proven method for welding high strength aluminium alloys which were previously not recommended for conventional fusion welding. Since {{the invention of the}} process by The Welding Institute, United Kingdom, in 1991, {{a number of studies have}} been conducted on the material flow, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of friction stir welds. However, there is not enough conceptual background available on FSW process for physical understanding of the mechanism of weld formation. In addition to that, FSW welds of high strength precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys suffer from reduced joint efficiency due to overaging in the heat affected zone. In the present investigation, experimental analysis has been carried out to understand the mechanism of weld formation and parameter optimization for aluminium alloys 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6. For this purpose the investigations have been made on both the process aspects and the material aspects. The process aspects are analyzed with the objective of learning the mechanism to produce defect free welds. For this purpose experiments have been carried out to analyze the effect of FSW parameters, material flow and the frictional characteristics between the tool and base metal. Preliminary experiments are conducted on aluminium alloy 7020 -T 6 with different tool geometries to analyze the interaction of the tool with the base metal using a knee-type vertical milling machine. Then, the tool geometry which produced defect-free weld is used for further experimentation. The role of tool pin, shoulder and axial load on the formation of defect free weld is analyzed in an innovative experiment, where the tool and base metal interaction is continuously increased by continuously increasing the interference between the tool and base metal. In another experiment the initial abutting interface position with respect to the tool is continuously varied to study the interaction of the tool with the initial interface and to find the positional information where the initial interface is completely eliminated. Further, the tool metal interface condition is studied using a specially designed tribological experiment which simulates the FSW condition. From the base metal point of view, due to the strain, strain rate and temperature imposed on the base metal during the process, the microstructure is altered. In precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys the strengthening precipitates are dissolved or overaged in the weld region depending on the peak temperature in the region, which reduces the joint efficiency. However, the dissolution and overaging are kinetic process. In order to analyze this time dependant softening behavior of the base metal 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6, isothermal annealing and differential scanning calorimetric studies are performed. In order to obtain FSW welds with maximum joint efficiency, the welding temperature should not exceed the “softening temperature” of the base metal. But, to produce defect free welds favorable material flow in the weld nugget is necessary. The material flow and consolidation depend on the process temperature. Hence, for a given tool to produce defect free weld there is a need for minimum temperature. If the weld formation temperature is less than the base metal softening temperature, the weld can be made with 100 % joint efficiency. In order to optimize the FSW parameter which gives defect free weld with lowest possible temperature, an instrumented programmable FSW machine is designed and developed. The machine is designed in such a way that welding parameters – rotation speed, traverse speed and plunging depth – can be continuously varied from the start to end of the weld between given two values. This reduces the number of experimental trials, material and time. Based on the experimental results the following conclusions are derived. 1. The minimum diameter of the pin required for FSW depends on the base metal and tool material property for a given set of parameters. If the pin diameter is insufficient for a given set of welding parameters, it fails during plunging operation itself. 2. There is a minimum diameter of the shoulder for a given diameter of the pin which produces defect free weld. The ratio of pin to shoulder to produce a defect free weld is not a constant value. It changes with tool geometry and process parameters. 3. Increasing the area of contact between the tool and shoulder for a given set of parameters increases the heat input and results in increased weld nugget grain size. 4. Initial abutting interface of the base metal is eliminated at the leading edge of the tool. However, new surfaces are generated due to interaction with the tool and the newer surfaces are consolidated at the trailing edge of the tool. Importantly, the weld strength is controlled by the defects generated due the improper elimination of newly generated surfaces. 5. Optimal axial load is required to generate the required pressure to consolidate the transferred material at the trailing edge of the tool and should be equal to the flow stress of the material at the processing temperature. The optimal axial load is 8. 1 kN for a tool having 20 mm diameter shoulder with 6 mm diameter frustum shaped pin. 6. Only the material that approaches the tool at the leading edge on the advancing side is stirred and the remaining material is simply <b>extruded</b> around the <b>tool.</b> Further, the initial abutting interface is completely removed only when it is located in the stirring zone, otherwise the initial abutting interface is not eliminated. In the present study the interface is completely stirred when it is located on the advancing side of the tool between 0. 5 mm away from the centerline and edge of the tool. 7. The temperature and pressure at the tool–base metal interface is above the temperature and pressure required for seizure to occur for given tool material (H 13) and base metal (7020 -T 6). Hence, it is clear that during FSW the base metal transfers on to the tool and interaction occurs between transferred layer on tool and base metal. The coefficient of friction between the given tool material and base metal in FSW condition is in the range of 1. 2 – 1. 4. 8. The minimum temperature requirement for FSW of 7020 -T 6 is 400 oC and 6061 -T 6 is 430 oC. However, 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6 softens at lower temperatures than that of the minimum FSW temperature. 7020 -T 6 softens 30 % in 7 min at 250 oC, 4 min at 300 oC, 2 min at 350 oC and 1 min at 400 oC. After softening 30 %, there is 10 % recovery in hardness and the hardness remains constant thereafter. Whereas 6061 -T 6 softens gradually up to 47 % in 7 min at 350 oC and 400 oC, below the temperature of 250 oC for 7020 -T 6 and 350 oC for 6061 -T 6 there is no softening observed in 7 min. 9. The maximum joint efficiency of the 7020 -T 6 weld is 82 % and 6061 -T 6 weld is 60 %. 10. The reduction in joint efficiency is attributed to overaging of the material in the heat affected zone...|$|R
