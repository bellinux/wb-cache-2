Though successful, Joe's victory is short-lived when he is fooled by an impostor Silvia into giving Gedow the Oscars. Faced with his disastrous mistake, Joe and Silvia return to the original Captain Blue movie where they encounter Dr. Cranken again. The mad scientist reveals the impostor Silvia as Miss Bloody Rachel, a shapeshifting android programmed to destroy the heroes. As Rachel transforms into the previous bosses to fight back, Joe and Silvia attempt to reason with her by introducing the concept of a heart to her programming. Slowly, Rachel begins to understand and eventually chooses to side with the heroes. After Joe and Silvia finish off Dr. Cranken for good, Rachel gives them the sixth Rainbow Oscar.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{introduces}} the intertwined concepts of coping and resilience, with their varied dimensions. Beginning with brief stories that show how individuals, groups, communities and nations display both coping and resilience every day, the analysis shifts {{to the meaning}} of every day stress and adversity that have become inevitable parts of daily jigsaw puzzle of life.

30|$|As {{presented}} in this paper, one promising and dynamic approach for any woman entrepreneur or wannabe entrepreneur relies on her efforts to identify, understand and make proper use of her existing <b>inner</b> <b>strengths</b> in her business endeavours. During this process that actually sets free the strengths within her, a mentor is catalytic in facilitating her to recognise her strengths, {{with a focus on}} those that empower her business growth, {{and at the same time}} manage to surface and exploit her untapped potential. It is noted that this approach fits both sexes and it is practiced by both; nevertheless, women tend to be more receptive to trying such informal methods.|$|R

500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing {{there is something about}} this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates <b>inner</b> <b>strength</b> even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday".

In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of <b>inner</b> <b>strength</b> in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E

Still, current progress and findings are impressive and encouraging so as to continue effort on applying the strengths approach model in meeting the challenge and reaching the goal set. So far, higher staff productivity is reported as well as better daily work schedule for the woman entrepreneur (although still working long hours) which has allowed more time available for strategic orientation and business growth. Furthermore, by adopting the principles of strengths-based mentoring herself, she now feels better in helping her team to discover and free their <b>inner</b> <b>strengths,</b> which increases their work performance, satisfaction and experience.|$|R
30|$|Discovery. This {{initial stage}} {{is crucial in}} the {{mentoring}} relationship and one which instigates the strengths-based approach. The mentor, already trained in the strengths based approach and aware of his/her strengths spotting skills, facilitates the mentee in discovering her own strengths, {{through the use of}} a scientific test and powerful questions, with the aim to raise her awareness of her strong self. This stage is of paramount importance for the mentee since it can assist her in embarking on a journey of self-reflection, a process of understanding and evaluating herself, which raises her awareness of her <b>inner</b> <b>strengths</b> and the possible ways to combine and apply them in her activities and achieve her goals.|$|R
