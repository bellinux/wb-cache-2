40|$|High stone asphalt {{surfacing}} mixes {{are widely}} used around the world. Although their high stone content has reduced problems with permanent deformation they pose a problem when they become polished and don’t meet minimum requirements for safety. It {{may be possible to}} overlay with another thin surfacing, remove and recycle or re-texture. Each process has differing merits in terms of sustainability. This paper considers chip seal as an alternative method. Traditionally, chip seal has been viewed as being noisy and has not been considered for use in urban areas where noise {{is an important factor in}} the selection of a new surface. Research at University of Ulster in noise prediction highlighted that smaller stone size chip seal surfaces can achieve significant noise reduction so offering an additional alternative for resurfacing. A laboratory study <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> <b>embedment</b> has investigated change in texture depth and skid resistance for a range <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> sizes and asphalt mix types. This has developed laboratory techniques that appear to rank the <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> seal aggregates in relation to underlying road material. This study has shown less embedment for high stone mixes and confirms the findings of limited small stone size chip seal road trials where skid resistance and texture depth was monitored.

30|$|Plywood-sheathed {{structural}} diaphragms with nailed joints {{are commonly}} used {{in the construction of}} light wooden frames or other types of structures. Past {{studies have shown that the}} in-plane shear resistance performance of the diaphragms is mainly dominated by the shear performance of the nailed joints [1 – 4]. The <b>embedment</b> behavior <b>of</b> wood by a nail is an important characteristic that strongly influences the shear performance of the joints. This characteristic has been used to analyze or predict shear performances on the basis of European Yield Theory [5, 6], elastic foundation model [7 – 12], and finite element method [13 – 15]. Therefore, the <b>embedment</b> behavior <b>of</b> wood and wood-based materials by a nail must be clarified. The <b>embedment</b> behaviors <b>of</b> various types of wooden materials by dowel-type fasteners have been investigated under different loading conditions.

40|$|There {{are three}} self-dual models of massive {{particles}} of helicity + 2 (or - 2) in D= 2 + 1. Each model is of first, second, and third-order in derivatives.

In fact, each self-dual model {{can be obtained from}} the previous one SD^(i) →SD^(i+ 1), i= 1, 2, 3 by the Noether <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> an appropriate gauge symmetry, culminating in SD^(4). The new model may be identified with the linearized version of HDTMG = ϵ^μνρΓ_μγ^ϵ (_νΓ_ϵρ^γ + (2 / 3) Γ_νδ^γΓ_ρϵ^δ) / 8 m + √(-g) (R_μν R^νμ - 3 R^ 2 / 8) / 2 m^ 2. We also construct a master action relating the third-order self-dual model to SD^(4) by means of a mixing term with no particle content which assures spectrum equivalence of SD^(4) to other lower-order self-dual models despite its pure higher derivative nature and the absence of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The relevant degrees of freedom of SD^(4) are encoded in a rank-two tensor which is symmetric, traceless and transverse due to trivial (non-dynamic) identities, contrary to other spin- 2 self-dual models. We also show that the Noether <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> the Fierz-Pauli theory leads to the new massive gravity of Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend.

40|$|Surface {{modification}} of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes was successfully performed by doping anhydrous and hydrated aluminum oxide particles (γ-alumina, boehmite and gibbsite) through in situ particle embedment and subsequent crystal growth under a hydrothermal environment. The approach <b>of</b> particle <b>embedment</b> involves the dispersion of anhydrous or hydrated aluminum oxide {{particles in the}} water phase during PVDF membrane precipitation, {{and the result was}} found to strongly depend on the change of free energy in particle-membrane interaction. The <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> γ-alumina nanoparticles is thermodynamically favorable, but the <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> boehmite or gibbsite particles is less favorable, especially when using hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) additive within the membrane cast solution. The approach of 105 °C hydrothermal treatment initiates the growth of gibbsite on embedded γ-alumina nanoparticles, and the treatment duration determines the coverage of gibbsite particles on PVDF membrane. The overall hydrophilicity of membranes increases with the <b>embedment</b> <b>of</b> γ-alumina and the growth of gibbsite. An increase of membrane resistance was not observed with γ-alumina embedment, but the excessive growth of gibbsite particles may reduce membrane permeability. The Escherichia coli attachment result shows that the surface doping of aluminum oxide particles can greatly reduce E. coli adhesion to the membrane surface, suggesting the positive effect on the reduction of bio-fouling. The success of this PVDF membrane modification method has also provided a promising strategy to manipulate the surface property of other polymer membranes by inorganic materials. © 2010 Elsevier B.
