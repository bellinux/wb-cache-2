50|$|Sales of analog {{machines}} {{continued to}} be strong into the early 1990s when they began {{to be replaced by}} digital recorders. in this period Studer introduced the D820 and D827 multitrack models, which employed the <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head</b> standard. However, digital tape formats eventually fell from favor with the introduction of computerized hard disk drive systems such as Pro Tools.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, the Sony Corporation and Philips Consumer Electronics (Philips) {{published}} the Red Book for the Compact Disc, an industry standard of consumer grade digital media. Many recording studios retooled to support {{end to end}} digital production. MCI {{was one of several}} major equipment manufacturers that backed the Sony Corporation’s new <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head</b> digital recording standard. In the early 1980s Sony wanted to extend its business operations into the US manufacturing sector and approached Harned with a buyout offer. The Sony Professional Products Division was established in Fort Lauderdale specifically to accommodate this acquisition.|$|E
5000|$|Mitsubishi's ProDigi was a {{professional}} audio, reel-to-reel, digital audio tape format with a stationary head position, similar to Sony's <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head,</b> which competed against ProDigi when the format was available in the mid-1980s through the early 1990s. Audio was digitally recorded linearly on the tape and is guarded by a powerful error correction scheme of cyclic redundancy checks to ensure integrity of the signal even if data is lost during playback. Prodigi recorders were available in 2-track variations, which used 1/4" [...] tape; 32-track variations, which used 1" [...] tape, and a 16-track version using 1/2" [...] tape. All of the machines {{require the use of}} metal-particle magnetic tape.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accepted}} world {{standard was}} created by Sony along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and Mitsubishi Corporation created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently {{and it could be}} edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the [...] "DASH" [...] format meaning, [...] " [...] <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the dynamic range and signal to noise ratios.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{few years}} after the {{introduction}} of digital recording, multitrack recorders (using <b>stationary</b> <b>heads)</b> were being produced for use in professional studios. In the early 1990s, relatively low-priced multitrack digital recorders were introduced for use in home studios; they returned to recording on videotape. The most notable of this type of recorder is the ADAT. Developed by Alesis and first released in 1991, the ADAT machine is capable of recording 8 tracks of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> onto a single S-VHS video cassette. The ADAT machine is still a very common fixture in professional and home studios around the world.|$|R

5000|$|Nagra D - 4 channel PCM {{digital audio}} recorder. Instead of {{recording}} to the DAT format, the D used a digital reel-to-reel format using a helical scan head and 1/4" [...] tape on 5" [...] and 7" [...] reels. The tape {{is identical to}} that used on <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head</b> machines such as the Sony PCM-3202 and Mitsubishi X-86 series. The unique format, combined with its heavy weight, made it somewhat unpopular with many production sound mixers, but year after year many great-sounding films were completed with Nagra Ds (and the newer 24-bit/96 kHz Nagra DII). Despite some popularity in the late 1990s, the Nagra D and DII are a rarity on US films as of the mid-2000s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head</b> or DASH {{standard}} is a reel-to-reel, {{digital audio tape}} format introduced by Sony in early 1982 for high-quality multitrack studio recording and mastering, {{as an alternative to}} analog recording methods. DASH is capable of recording two channels of audio on a quarter-inch tape, and 24 or 48 tracks on 1/2 in tape on open reels of up to 14 inches. The data is recorded on the tape linearly, with a stationary recording head, as opposed to the DAT format, where data is recorded helically with a rotating head, {{in the same manner as}} a VCR. The audio data is encoded as linear PCM and boasts strong cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error correction, allowing the tape to be physically edited with a razor blade as analog tape would, e.g. by cutting and splicing, and played back with no loss of signal. In a two-track DASH recorder, the digital data is recorded onto the tape across nine data tracks: eight for the digital audio data and one for the CRC data; there is also provision for two linear analog cue tracks and one additional linear analog track dedicated to recording time code.|$|E
50|$|As {{professional}} audio {{evolved from}} analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical {{enough to make}} hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. Mitsubishi's ProDigi and Sony's <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Stationary</b> <b>Head</b> (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Nagra introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency roll-off, wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.|$|E
