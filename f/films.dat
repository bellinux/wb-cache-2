5|$|Thirteen {{animated}} theatrical <b>films</b> {{based on}} the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The <b>films</b> are typically released in March {{in accordance with the}} spring vacation of Japanese schools. The <b>films</b> feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three <b>films</b> were typically double features paired up with other anime <b>films,</b> and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The <b>films</b> themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity.

5|$|Traditionally, war <b>films,</b> musicals and {{historical}} dramas {{have been the}} most popular genres, but franchise <b>films</b> have been among the best performers in the 21st century.

There is also continued interest in the superhero genre: Batman and Superman from DC Comics and <b>films</b> based on the Marvel Comics brand, such as Spider-Man, X-Men and <b>films</b> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have generally done well. The only <b>films</b> in the top ten that are not adapted from a pre-existing property or a sequel are the top two, Avatar and Titanic, both directed by James Cameron. Animated family <b>films</b> have performed consistently well, with Disney <b>films</b> enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with <b>films</b> such as Frozen (the highest-grossing animated film), Zootopia and The Lion King, as well as with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story and Finding Nemo <b>films</b> have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.|$|E
