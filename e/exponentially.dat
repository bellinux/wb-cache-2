5|$|Annual growth {{increases}} <b>exponentially</b> for {{the first}} eight years or so, but then slows down as resources are diverted into reproduction and the greater density of foliage results in reduced photosynthetic efficiency.|$|E
5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew <b>exponentially.</b> Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew <b>exponentially</b> {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease and exhaustion and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{the men and}} {{vessels of}} the RAN served in every theatre of operations, from the {{tropical}} Pacific to the frigid Russian convoys and grew <b>exponentially.</b> The table illustrates {{the growth of the}} RAN between the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 and 30 June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles {{large volumes}} of data which pose a {{significant}} storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow <b>exponentially,</b> with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E
5|$|The model postulates bubble nuclei with aqueous and/or lipid skin structure, in {{a number}} and size {{distribution}} quantified by an equation-of-state. Like the VPM, RGBM assumes the size distribution is <b>exponentially</b> decreasing in size. Unlike the varying permeability model, bubble seeds are assumed permeable to gas transfer across skin boundaries under all pressures.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an <b>exponentially</b> fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earnings}} have <b>exponentially</b> increased {{following his}} death. According {{to a report}} by Forbes in 2016, he had been the top-earning dead celebrity each year since his death, with triple-digit millions per annum ($825 million in 2016). In December 2015, Thriller became the first album in the United States to surpass 30 million shipments, certifying it 30× platinum. One year later, the album was certified again at 33× platinum, surpassing 33 million shipments after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications.|$|E
5|$|Many thrips {{species are}} pests of commercially {{important}} crops. A few species serve as vectors for over 20 viruses that cause plant disease, especially the Tospoviruses. Some species of thrips are beneficial as pollinators or as predators of other insects or mites. In the right conditions, {{such as in}} greenhouses, many species can <b>exponentially</b> increase in population size and form large swarms {{because of a lack}} of natural predators coupled with their ability to reproduce asexually, making them an irritation to humans. Their identification to species by standard morphological characters is often challenging.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with <b>exponentially</b> many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
5|$|The U-boat base at Bergen grew <b>exponentially</b> {{after the}} liberation of France by the Western Allies, when the senior {{commanding}} officer of U-boat operations in the west ("FdU West") was moved from Angers, France to the city. A large expansion program was conducted at the base and several new anti-aircraft guns were set up to protect the U-boat bunkers. More engineers and technicians were moved to Bergen to accommodate the increased technical requirements of the base as well. Two more bunkers named Werft Gemeinschaftslager 1 and Gemeinschaftslager 2 were also built during this time.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{amount of}} <b>exponentially</b> growing {{sequence}} data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing <b>exponentially.</b>|$|E
25|$|When x is positive, Ai(x) is positive, convex, and {{decreasing}} <b>exponentially</b> to zero, while Bi(x) is positive, convex, and increasing <b>exponentially.</b> When x is negative, Ai(x) and Bi(x) oscillate around zero with ever-increasing frequency and ever-decreasing amplitude. This {{is supported by}} the asymptotic formulae below for the Airy functions.|$|E
25|$|If a flow on a {{manifold}} {{splits the}} tangent bundle into three invariant subbundles, with one subbundle that is <b>exponentially</b> contracting, {{and one that}} is <b>exponentially</b> expanding, and a third, non-expanding, non-contracting one-dimensional sub-bundle (spanned by the flow direction), then the flow is called an Anosov flow.|$|E

25|$|The {{major impact}} of {{intraspecific}} competition is reduced population growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, intraspecific competition {{does not occur}} and populations can grow <b>exponentially.</b> Exponential population growth is exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew <b>exponentially</b> in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place.|$|E

25|$|If the {{parameters}} of any second-order linear differential equation are varied periodically, Floquet analysis shows that the solutions must vary either sinusoidally or <b>exponentially.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} light {{transmitted}} through a material diminishes <b>exponentially</b> as it travels through the material, according to the Beer–Lambert law (A=(ε)(l)). Since the absorbance of a sample is measured as a logarithm, it is directly proportional to {{the thickness of the}} sample and to the concentration of the absorbing material in the sample. Some other measures related to absorption, such as transmittance, are measured as a simple ratio so they vary <b>exponentially</b> with the thickness and concentration of the material.|$|E

25|$|From the {{description}} {{in terms of}} independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed <b>exponentially,</b> since {{there is a constant}} probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to p, so the correlations fall off <b>exponentially.</b>|$|E
