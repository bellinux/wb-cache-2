In a pot experiment, {{carried out}} in three series in years 2010 - 2012 at the {{greenhouse}} laboratory of the University of Warmia and Mazury <b>in</b> Olsztyn, <b>the</b> effect of Persian clover undersown and plant density on the morphological characteristics of spring wheat was evaluated. Experimental factors were as follows: I) spring wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare L.) sowing method: pure sowing and with Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.) undersown, II) density of both species <b>in</b> agreement with <b>the</b> recommendations of agrotechnics (called “higher ” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present work) and lowered by 20 % (called “lower”). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> of 22 cm <b>in</b> diameter, <b>the</b> following plants were sown: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> with higher density, 19 spring wheat grains and 12 seeds of Persian clover, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> with lower density, 12 wheat grains and nine clover seeds. Measurements were undertaken at the following developmental stages of wheat (the BBCH scale) : leaf development (12 - 14), tillering (21 - 23), straw shooting (31 - 32), earing (54 - 56), and ripening (87 - 89).

Leaf mass to area ratio and leaf carbon content per unit mass increased, while leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (Nm) remained constant, with increasing relative irradiance (RI). Maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and maximum electron transport flux (Jmax) increased with RI and were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> natural regeneration than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>potted</b> saplings. These two parameters were higher for <b>the</b> <b>potted</b> saplings <b>in</b> north-eastern France than for those in southern France.

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E
25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center.

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
25|$|A nine-point game {{is another}} variant of match play {{typically}} played among threesomes, where each hole {{is worth a}} total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format {{can be used to}} wager on the game systematically; players each contribute {{the same amount of money}} to the pot, and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> with any overage going to the overall winner.|$|E

500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot.</b> [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art".

500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> of boiling water {{for as long as it}} takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E
