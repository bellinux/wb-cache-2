5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped <b>furrows</b> along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the <b>furrows</b> and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

40|$|The {{mitotic spindle}} determines the {{cleavage}} <b>furrow</b> site during metazoan cell division, but whether other mechanisms exist remains unknown. Here we identify a spindle-independent mechanism for cleavage <b>furrow</b> positioning in Drosophila neuroblasts. We show that {{early and late}} <b>furrow</b> proteins (Pavarotti, Anillin, and Myosin) are localized to the neuroblast basal cortex at anaphase onset by a Pins cortical polarity pathway, and can induce a basally displaced <b>furrow</b> even in the complete absence of a mitotic spindle.

5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and <b>furrows.</b> A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse <b>furrows</b> and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E

5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by <b>furrows.</b> LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
40|$|SummaryCell {{division}} {{is achieved by}} a plasma membrane <b>furrow</b> that must ingress between the segregating chromosomes during anaphase [1 – 3]. The force that drives <b>furrow</b> ingression is generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which {{is linked to the}} membrane by an as yet undefined molecular mechanism. A key component of the membrane <b>furrow</b> is anillin. Upon targeting to the <b>furrow</b> through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, anillin acts as a scaffold linking the actomyosin and septin cytoskeletons to maintain <b>furrow</b> stability (reviewed in [4, 5]). We report that the PH domain of anillin interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids (PIPs), including PI(4, 5) P 2, which is enriched in the <b>furrow.</b> Reduction of cellular PI(4, 5) P 2 or mutations in the PH domain of anillin that specifically disrupt the interaction with PI(4, 5) P 2, interfere with the localization of anillin to the <b>furrow.</b> Reduced expression of anillin disrupts symmetric <b>furrow</b> ingression that can be restored by targeting ectopically expressed anillin to the <b>furrow</b> using an alternate PI(4, 5) P 2 binding module, a condition where the septin cytoskeleton is not recruited to the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that the anillin PH domain has two functions: targeting anillin to the <b>furrow</b> by binding to PI(4, 5) P 2 to maintain <b>furrow</b> organization and recruiting septins to the <b>furrow...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the eggs}} of the newt, Triturus pyrrhogaster, 2 {{separate}} factors are recognized which {{take part in}} cleavage <b>furrow</b> formation. (1) The inductive capacity for the <b>furrow</b> formation by the cytoplasm lying under the cortex along the cleavage <b>furrow</b> (FIC); and (2) the reactivity of the overlying cortex to form a <b>furrow</b> in response to FIC. (1) FIC. The inductive capacity is shown {{by the fact that}} FIC induces a <b>furrow</b> on which-ever part of the surface under which FIC is transplanted. FIC is distributed along the cleavage <b>furrow</b> and even extends along the future <b>furrow</b> plane ahead of the <b>furrow</b> tip. The distance FIC precedes the <b>furrow</b> tip is about 10 mm in the animal hemisphere and is less in the vegetal hemisphere. In the direction at right angles to the <b>furrow</b> plane, FIC does not spread more than 01 mm. FIC is also present in the eggs of Xenopus laevis. Species specificity of FIC for induction is not found between Triturus and Xenopus. (2) Surface layer. At the onset of the first cleavage, the reactivity of the cortex to form the <b>furrow</b> in answer to FIC induction is localized on the animal pole region. The reactivity of the cortex propagates medially as a belt along the surface towards the vegetal pole with the advanc-ing tip of the cleavage <b>furrow.</b> After the <b>furrow</b> is completed, the reactivity begins to be lost from the animal pole region, and eventually over the entire surface. The reactivity, however, reappears on the animal pole region simultaneously with the second cleavage...|$|R
40|$|Although Aurora B is {{important}} in cleavage <b>furrow</b> ingression and completion during cytokinesis, the mechanism by which kinase activity is targeted to the cleavage <b>furrow</b> and the molecule(s) responsible for this process have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that an essential mitotic kinesin MKlp 2 requires myosin-II for its localization to the equatorial cortex, and this event is required to recruit Aurora B to the equatorial cortex in mammalian cells. This recruitment event is also required to promote the highly focused accumulation of active RhoA at the equatorial cortex and stable ingression of the cleavage <b>furrow</b> in bipolar cytokinesis. Specifically, in drug-induced monopolar cytokinesis, targeting Aurora B to the cell cortex by MKlp 2 is essential for cell polarization and <b>furrow</b> formation. Once the <b>furrow</b> has formed, MKlp 2 further recruits Aurora B to the growing <b>furrow.</b> This process together with continuous Aurora B kinase activity at the growing <b>furrow</b> is essential for stable <b>furrow</b> propagation and completion. In contrast, a MKlp 2 mutant defective in binding myosin-II does not recruit Aurora B to the cell cortex and does not promote <b>furrow</b> formation during monopolar cytokinesis. This mutant is also defective in maintaining the ingressing <b>furrow</b> during bipolar cytokinesis. Together, these findings reveal that targeting Aurora B to the cell cortex (or the equatorial cortex) by MKlp 2 {{is essential for the}} maintenance of the ingressing <b>furrow</b> for successful cytokinesis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Furrow</b> {{erosion and}} {{sediment}} 	 deposition redistributes topsoil within fields.
