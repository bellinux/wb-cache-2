40|$|The {{concept of}} Essentially derived {{varieties}} (EDVs) {{was introduced in}} the UPOV 1991 act to protect the interests of the breeder of the <b>initial</b> <b>variety.</b> When a variety is considered as an EDV, authorisation for commercial exploitation is needed from the breeder of the <b>initial</b> <b>variety.</b> There is considerable debate going on about which approaches to use for determining essential derivation and also which thresh-olds should be used in the different plant species. For determining whether a variety should be considered essentially derived from an existing variety two conceptually different approaches can be taken. The first one is based on genetic conformity, the second is more a forensic approach. For the implementation of the EDV concept using the conformity approach it is important that similarities between unrelated varieties can clearly be separated from essentially derived varieties. In the forensic approach the high genetic similarity between original variety and mutant is taken as a starting point. The basic idea is to calculate the probability that a second, putatively derived, variety would have a profile identical to the <b>initial</b> <b>variety,</b> given an independent breeding history. Both approaches will be illustrated and ways to implement the EDV concept will be discusse...|$|E
40|$|To get the {{protection}} for essentially derived variety, the <b>initial</b> <b>variety</b> {{must be a}} protected first, because the dependence can onlyexist in relation to protected variety. While determining whether a variety is EDV or not, {{it is to be}} noted that, an EDV can bedirectly derived from the <b>initial</b> <b>variety</b> or from any variety that itself is predominantly derived from the <b>initial</b> <b>variety.</b> Hencethere can be "cascade" of derivations. In determining the cascade of derivation, {{it should be noted that}} each EDV shall only bedependent on one, the protected initial variety; a cascade of dependence shall not exist. This principle of dependence has beenintroduced to better protect the breeder of the <b>initial</b> <b>variety</b> and not those having made just derivations. More recently, based onthe general opinion of its members, ISF moved to the definition of only one threshold that would divide the scale of conformityinto two parts: below the threshold there would be no presumption of essential derivation, above the threshold there would bepresumption of essential derivation and the burden of proof of non predominant derivation would fall on the breeder of theputative essentially derived variety. The threshold will certainly vary from species to species, depending on the existing geneticvariability within the species and the established breeding procedures. To eliminate the ‘copycat breeding’ or ‘cosmetic breeding’,the concept of ‘essential derivation’ was included in the revised UPOV convention Act (UPOV, 1991). This paper thereforefocuses on the imminent challenges to the breeders and the responsibilities they need to shoulder to respect and promote the IPand plant variety protection in India to usher in an era of incentives and benefit sharing for the plant breeders...|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the concept of}} ‘essential derivation’ which refers to the {{situation}} where the breeder of one variety – the ‘initial variety’ – claims that another breeder has developed a second variety – the ‘putative essentially derived variety’ – that is virtually the same as the <b>initial</b> <b>variety.</b> Clarity is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of essen­tial derivation as a legal concept and, more broadly, to enable the plant breeders’ rights scheme to remain relevant. In examining the concept of essential derivation, this article first looks at the general trends in plant breeding techniques.

This is followed by a discussion of the scientific (quan­ti­tative) approach to determining whether a variety is essentially derived and outlines the limits of such an approach.

40|$|In the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Act of 1991, {{mutation}} {{is mentioned}} {{as one of}} the mechanisms to obtain an `essentially derived' variety (EDV). For the implementation of the EDV concept in the case of mutation, {{it is important that the}} level of genetic relatedness between an <b>initial</b> <b>variety</b> and derived mutant varieties can clearly be distinguished from the level of relatedness between arbitrary pairs of varieties without a derivation relation. Conditions to be fulfilled for such a distinction include enough genetic differentiation in the germplasm pool of interest, sufficiently low levels of genomic sampling error and technical laboratory error and high reproducibility within and between laboratories. In rose, mutants or `sports' are frequently observed during multiplication, making it a suitable crop for studying the possibilities for introduction of the EDV concept in ornamentals. We studied genetic similarities among 83 rose varieties, including 13 mutant groups. Twelve AFLP primer combinations generated 284 polymorphic markers and 114 monomorphic (fixed) bands. Pair-wise Jaccard similarities between original varieties and derived mutants were close to 1. 0 (> 0. 96), whereas all similarities between original varieties were below 0. 80, with 75 % of the non-mutant similarities even being below 0. 50. Values less than 1. 0 for similarity among original varieties and their mutants were to a major extent due to scoring errors. Error rates in automated scoring proved to be lower than those in manually scored and transferred data. Experimental errors, even between laboratories, turned out to be very small. On the basis of a consistent and large difference between similarities, relations between an original variety and its mutants can easily be identified and distinguished from relations between original varieties. These results open the way for implementing the essential derivation concept in rose...|$|E

World needs 60 % more wheat for 9 billion population by 2050 but climate change with increasing temperature {{is projected to}} affect wheat productivity adversely. Trait improvement and management of wheat germplasm requires genomic resource. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) being highly polymorphic and ubiquitously distributed in the genome, can be a marker of choice {{but there is no}} structured marker database with options to generate primer pairs for genotyping on desired chromosome/physical location. Previously associated markers with different wheat trait are also not available in any database. Limitations of in vitro SSR discovery can be overcome by genome-wide in silico mining of SSR. Triticum aestivum SSR database (TaSSRDb) is an integrated online database with three-tier architecture, developed using PHP and MySQL and accessible at [URL] For genotyping, Primer 3 standalone code computes primers on user request. Chromosome-wise SSR calling for all the three sub genomes along with choice of motif types is provided in addition to the primer generation for desired marker. We report here a database of highest number of SSRs (476, 169) from complex, hexaploid wheat genome (~ 17 GB) along with previously reported 268 SSR markers associated with 11 traits. Highest (116. 93 SSRs/Mb) and lowest (74. 57 SSRs/Mb) SSR densities were found on 2 D and 3 A chromosome, respectively. To obtain homozygous locus, e-PCR was done. Such 30 loci were randomly selected for PCR validation in panel of 18 wheat Advance Varietal Trial (AVT) lines. TaSSRDb can be a valuable genomic resource tool for linkage mapping, gene/QTL (Quantitative trait locus) discovery, diversity analysis, traceability and variety identification.

40|$|Abstract Plant Growth Regulator Sprays and Girdling: Potential Horticultural Techniques to Increase Fruit Retention and Yield of Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) Trees in California Leila Graves June 2009 The longan is a {{subtropical}} {{fruit tree}} whose popularity is growing quickly among American consumers, and thus, {{could become a}} lucrative niche market for California growers. Trees planted {{as part of an}} <b>initial</b> <b>variety</b> trial conducted in commercial California orchards are beginning to bear fruit. However, fruit retention and yields are low due to excessive abscission during early fruit set. Horticultural techniques, such as plant growth regulator (PGR) sprays and girdling, often increase fruit retention and yield of fruit tree crops, though effects are typically dependent on treatment timing and PGR concentration. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify PGR and girdling techniques that result in increased longan fruit retention. The experiment was conducted in a commercial orchard using a randomized complete block design with whole-tree experimental units and five replications per treatment. Treatments included foliar applications of two synthetic auxins, 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at 20, 60, or 100 ppm or 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) at 5, 25, or 45 ppm, each applied during early or late fruit set. Girdling was also conducted at early or late fruit set, for a total of 15 treatments, including an untreated control. Factors examined at harvest included fruit number and mass per inflorescence and individual fruit mass and diameter. During the on-crop year, a significant increase in the number and mass of fruit per inflorescence was observed in response to 25 ppm 2, 4 -D applied at late fruit set, as compared to the control. Despite this increase in fruit number, 25 ppm 2, 4 -D applied at late fruit set did not result in decreased diameter and mass of individual fruit. Late fruit set applications of 25 ppm 2, 4 -D appear to mitigate the effects of alternate bearing in the off-crop year. Fruit abscission during early and/or late fruit set decreased in response to 5 ppm 2, 4 -D at early fruit set, 25 or 45 ppm 2, 4 -D at early or late fruit set, or 100 ppm NAA at early fruit set. Fruit loss occurred as a result of Santa Ana winds during both growing seasons. Neither leaf nor fruit nutrient concentrations of treated trees were significantly different from that of untreated controls. Results indicate that properly-timed PGR applications have the potential to be used commercially to increase yield and profit to longan growers in California...|$|E
