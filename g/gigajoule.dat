25|$|A <b>gigajoule</b> (GJ) is {{a measure}} {{approximately}} equal to half a barrel (250lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or 1000cu ft of gas, or 28m3 of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from 37 to 43 MJ per m3 depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the world, natural gas is sold in <b>gigajoule</b> retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG (liquefied {{petroleum}} gas) are traded in metric tons or MMBTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic metres, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes (1,000kg). The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships, as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Canada uses metric {{measure for}} {{internal}} trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, {{natural gas is}} sold by the <b>gigajoule,</b> cubic metre (m3) or thousand cubic metres (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic metre). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). [...] In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m3 or ft3), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per <b>gigajoule.</b> In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3). Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU. Thus, {{if the price of}} gas is $10 per million BTUs on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gigajoule</b> (GJ) {{is equal}} to one billion (109) joules. 6 GJ is {{about the amount of}} {{potential}} chemical energy in 160 L (approximately one US standard barrel) of oil, when combusted. 2 GJ is about the Planck energy unit.|$|E

5000|$|Present {{oil sands}} {{extraction}} plants use {{natural gas to}} supply heat to make hot water or steam used in the separation of oil and sand. Using nuclear power instead of burning gas would prevent the emission of large quantities of carbon dioxide. The direct use of heat from nuclear reactors has been found cost effective in an energy analysis. [...] However, nuclear reactors have a lifetime of 50 years or more and cannot be moved {{so there is a}} problem supplying the heat where it is needed as nearby deposits are depleted. Energy Alberta appears to have no plans for using the heat directly; they plan to produce electricity which can easily be delivered anywhere. However, the cost of nuclear electricity is about 7 cents per kilowatt-hour when privately financed or more than $17 per <b>gigajoule</b> compared with $6 per <b>gigajoule</b> for natural gas. [...] Rising costs for gas and carbon taxes could change that picture.|$|E
