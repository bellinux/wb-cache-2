5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further currency war.

Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance <b>in</b> <b>competitive</b> football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game.

40|$|This study {{suggests}} that firms <b>in</b> highly <b>competitive</b> industries should have fewer outside board members, whereas companies operating <b>in</b> less <b>competitive</b> industries should have more outside directors. Specifically, we argue that board independence is less relevant or even redundant <b>in</b> highly <b>competitive</b> industries, where the firm is already "monitored" by a competitive product market. Using publicly traded Swedish firms for empirical testing, this study finds that board independence reduces firm performance in industries with highly competitive product markets. On the other hand, board independence enhances firm performance among companies facing less competitive product markets. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004. ...|$|R

Arsenal had conceded only three goals throughout the 1993–94 staging of the Cup Winners' Cup, and beat Italian side Parma by a single goal to win the final. The other Super Cup place went to Milan, winners of the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League. Milan defeated pre-match favourites Barcelona 4–0 in the final, a result which earnt the club their third top European honour in six years. Milan were appearing in the event for the fifth time; prior to the game against Arsenal, they had won the Super Cup in consecutive years (in 1989 and 1990), and were on the losing side twice (in 1973 and 1993). This was first meeting {{between the two sides}} <b>in</b> <b>competitive</b> European football.|$|E

5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races.

5|$|Graff and {{the other}} leaders of the school covertly work to isolate Ender from his fellow {{recruits}} and prevent him from growing too comfortable in his environment. The cadets participate <b>in</b> <b>competitive</b> war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom Ender first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and Ender unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>competitive</b> inhibition, the {{substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where {{the substrate}} also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E
