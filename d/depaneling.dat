50|$|UV laser <b>depaneling</b> {{makes use}} of a 355 nm {{wavelength}} (ultraviolet), diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser source. At this wavelength the laser is capable of cutting, drilling and structuring on rigid and flex circuit substrates. The laser beam, capable of cut widths under 25μm, is controlled by high-precision, galvo-scanning mirrors with repeat accuracy of +/- 4 μm.|$|E
50|$|Routers {{generate}} vibrations of {{the same}} frequency as their rotational speed (and higher harmonics), which might be important if there are vibration-sensitive components {{on the surface of}} the board. The strain level is lower than for other <b>depaneling</b> methods. Their advantage is that they are able to cut arcs and turn at sharp angles. Their disadvantage is lower capacity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Depaneling</b> is {{a process}} step in {{high-volume}} electronics assembly production. In order to increase the throughput of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and surface mount (SMT) lines, PCBs are often designed so that they consist of many smaller individual PCBs {{that will be used}} in the final product. This PCB cluster is called a panel or multiblock. The large panel is broken up or [...] "depaneled" [...] as a certain step in the process - depending on the product, it may happen right after SMT process, after in-circuit test (ICT), after soldering of through-hole elements, or even right before the final case-up of the assembly.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the trend}} of microelectronic devices is to achieve more {{functions}} but with smaller sizes. In order to fulfill this requirement, not only the density of packaging needs to be increased, but also the sizes of components have to be decreased. Due to the reduction of sizes, the electronic components may {{become more and more}} susceptible to the loading induced from various fabrication processes. <b>Depaneling</b> of printed circuit boards is quite common {{at the end of the}} manufacturing of microelectronic systems in order to singulate each individual unit. It is found that, if the boards are under a certain mechanical loading, the risk of cracking the tiny passive components is high. The present study is intended to establish a model for the failure prediction of passive components under the <b>depaneling</b> load condition. Both experimental testing and computational stress analysis are performed. The testing part is for the purpose of measuring <b>depaneling</b> load and board strains to validate the computational model. The computational stress analysis is performed with a 3 D finite element model. The emphasis is placed on finding the correlation between the bending strain on the PCB (which is an index of the local curvature of the bent PCB) and the bending stress in the passive components (which is the reason to crack chip capacitors/resistors). It is observed that such a relationship can be established. With this model, the cracking of passive components may be predicted under the <b>depaneling</b> load condition. The understanding of this potential threat can be turned into a design rule to avoid mounting passive components in the "high risk" area on the PCB. As a result, the objective of "design for reliability" can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Diode pumped {{solid state}} (DPSS) Q-switched {{nanosecond}} pulsed lasers are becoming the laser {{of choice for}} a wide variety of processes in printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing. Lasers are being used today in PCB manufacturing for via drilling, <b>depaneling,</b> profiling (cutting), laser direct imaging (LDI), repair, trimming, marking, skiving and other processes. The majority of these processes are practiced today using a 10. 6 μm CO 2 or 355 nm ultraviolet (UV) laser. In this study we have investigated the use of our new generation of Q-switched DPSS nanosecond pulsed 532 nm green laser for PCB processing.

40|$|Computational {{simulations}} {{have attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention in a number of manufacturing industries. This technology is widely used in the design aspects and has been introduced to the study of reliability issues. In electronic packaging industries, many standard reliability tests have been established over the past 15 years. These tests, however, takes a long time to conduct and it is not economically viable to carry out these time consuming tests before selling the products to the market. Therefore, design for reliability (DfR) through the use of computational analyses is adopted. The basic advantage of computational analyses is it shortens the time for the investigation of the product performances at the very beginning stage by predetermining all the possible failure mechanisms in the prolong operations. Accelerated temperature cycling test is one of the reliability testing methods for qualifying the electronic products. However, performing such tests for verifying different product designs usually time consuming. In this study, based on the data from previous research works, finite element analyses are carried out to simulate the accelerated thermal cycling tests. Comparison between computational and experimental approaches is made and it is suggested that 2 -D finite element analysis is sufficient for estimating the thermal fatigue life of PBGA assemblies with the advantages of reduced time and effort in model building. In addition, thermal cycling test involves many uncertainties. For example, test results obtained fiom different ATC machines may not be consistent since the conditions provided may vary. Therefore, parametric studies on the effects of various conditions during ATC tests are investigated by the computational method. During actual thermal cycling tests, the ideal temperature profile with four linear segments as specified in the industrial standard is usually difficult to achieve. Non-linear ramping rate in the profile, however, is the common observation when the temperature approaches extreme values. In this study, finite element analyses have been applied to find out the effects of such profile. Also, there is always a concern about the sudden break down of the thermal cycling machine during ATC tests. FE simulations have been carried out by introducing a period of service interruption in the middle of the thermal cycling test. Suggestions have been provided for the possibility of the resumption of the ATC tests when encountering this kind of machine breaks down. Stress free temperature of ATC test is another controversial topic in simulation which may also be a factor influences the test results. So, different starting temperatures have been investigated. Finite element analysis of the failure prediction of passive components under <b>depaneling</b> condition has also been proposed in this research work. Correlation between the bending strain on the PCB (which is an index of the local curvature of the bent PCB) and the bending stress in the passive components (which is the reason to crack capacitors/resistors) is established. Discussions are given on the modeling and the methodology of obtaining component stress distribution plots on PCBs. The outputs of this part of the thesis can provide a guiding rule to avoid mounting passive components in the "high risk" areas on the PCB at the design stage...|$|E
