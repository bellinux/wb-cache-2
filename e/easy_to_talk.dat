6000|$|... 'Will {{you tell}} me your name, my dear?' said Honora, feeling the {{children}} the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to; but the little girl's pretty lips pouted, and she nestled nearer to her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, Phil," [...] said Ogden. [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of {{cleaning}} out the yard; I'd {{like to see}} the gentleman set about it, or you either, for that matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|Foster remarked the girl's blush. Since {{she knew}} so much, it was plain that Lawrence {{had asked her}} to marry him and she had agreed.

6000|$|... "And I am sure I {{hope you}} will," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Leslie. And then {{the subject was}} allowed to drop; for Mr. Leslie {{knew that it was}} not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Miss Jack on such matters.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sandbrook coloured, {{and checked}} himself. Then after a pause, {{he said in}} a very {{different}} tone, 'Perhaps so, Kit. It is only too <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> Nora knows that there is a long way between my intentions and my practice.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, my friends, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> know than <b>to</b> believe, and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> know than <b>to</b> do. <b>Easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of Abraham's faith {{than to have}} Abraham's faith. <b>Easier</b> <b>to</b> preach {{learned and}} {{orthodox}} sermons about how Abraham was justified by his faith, than to be justified ourselves by our own faith.|$|R

5000|$|Says Kris: [...] "Besides that, {{they are}} the most {{accessible}} group--the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> We've got it so they're the ones who are doing the shooting and they're the ones who are digesting that same information.

6000|$|... "Some do; Aunt Jessie and {{her boys}} have capital talks, and I wish we could; but mother's so busy with her housekeeping, and father with his business, there {{never seems to}} be any time {{for that sort of}} thing; even if there was, it don't seem as if it would be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them, because we've never got into the way of it, you know." ...|$|E
40|$|We find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{class in}} purely {{economic}} terms.
