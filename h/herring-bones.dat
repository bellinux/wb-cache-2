40|$|The Himmelbaach quarry {{is located}} in the Wiltz Synclinorium in Luxembourg. The rocks {{outcropping}} in this quarry correspond to the mid-Emsian Clervaux Shales Formation. Three different facies have been identified in the quarry. An argillaceous sandstone facies with oblique stratifications, cross-stratifications, <b>herring-bones</b> and erosive bases represent the first facies; the second facies is characterized by lenticular- (with connected lenses) to wavy-bedded sandy argillites, argillaceous sandstones and quartz arenites. The last facies corresponds to a quartz arenite with oblique stratification, planar laminations and mud drapes. The base of this facies shows flaser bedding and sigmoidally curved bed surfaces. The palaeoenvironmental study of this area is rather difficult because of the structural deformation and lateral variation of the facies. Due to this deformation, six partial sections (4 a to 4 f) were sampled here. In order to reconstruct a reliable vertical and lateral succession of the depositional setting, facies analysis and magnetic susceptibility were used. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) is generally applied as a tool for correlation in a deepwater carbonated environment. In this paper we used the MS technique successfully in a siliciclastic proximal setting. Analysis of MS curves as well as the recognition of three marker beds ((1) the last bed of argillaceous sandstones in Facies 1; (2) a thin horizon of carbonated sandstone within Facies 2; (3) the first appearance of the characteristics massive quartzitic beds in Facies 3) allowed the correlation of sections 4 a, 4 b and 4 c. These correlations helped us to reconstruct a vertical and lateral succession of facies, which ultimately led to the recognition of a tide-dominated marginal-marine depositional model composed respectively of tidal channels (Facies 1), a tidal flat (Facies 2) and a tidal sand ridge (Facies 3). This example also shows the usefulness of magnetic susceptibility for small scale correlation, even in a proximal environment such as a marginal-marine setting. Peer reviewe...|$|E

50|$|The goal is {{to build}} in either {{direction}} (but all the same direction) on the 8 wrap-around foundations {{to the left and}} the right of the tableau. Only the lowest card of the <b>herring-bone</b> is available for play. One cannot build on the <b>herring-bone.</b> Four free cells are linked to “the herring-bone” in the center. You are allowed to fill them with the last card from the <b>herring-bone</b> if it does not fit to the foundations. When playing Long Braid one can drop to all free cells from the braid/bone. All free cells can be used to hold cards from the waste that may be useful soon. The biggest decision for the success of the game is whether to start building the families up or down.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the title compound, C_ 17 H_ 16 OS, is primarily stabilized by T-shaped and parallel-displaced aromatic clusters. The distances between the centroids of the aromatic pairs {{are in the range}} 4. 34 - 5. 30 A. In the crystal packing, the molecules dimerize by means of π-π interactions of both face-to-face and edge-to-face types, and the aromatic rings associate in a cyclic edge-to-face tetrameric arrangement of the <b>herring-bone</b> type. These <b>herring-bone</b> interactions appear to insulate hydrogen-bond interactions in the crystal structure...|$|R
