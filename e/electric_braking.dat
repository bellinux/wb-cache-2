25|$|Sheffield 513 {{was built}} by Charles Roberts & Co. of Wakefield to a design by Sheffield Transport, {{as one of a}} batch of 35 double deck trams {{constructed}} between 1950-1952. Fitted with comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, it ran on a 4-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and leaf spring suspension, powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors with a pair of Crompton-West CT/TJ controllers (fitted in restoration). Braking systems feature air brakes acting on all wheels, with <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> for emergency use. It only operated in Sheffield for eight years, as they abandoned their trams in 1960. It ran in the closing procession held on 8 October.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} for this series, number 501, was built at Queens Road works in August 1946. With comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, {{it was the}} last car to be built at the works. From 1950 to 1952 35 more, numbered 502536, were constructed by Charles Roberts & Co. of Horbury near Wakefield. They were carried on a four-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and leaf spring suspension, powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors. Air brakes were fitted, acting on all wheels, and <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> was available for emergency use. Car 536, which entered service on 11 April 1952, was the last tram to be constructed for Sheffield. Representing the ultimate development of the traditional British four-wheel tram, the class worked for only 10years, as Sheffield tramway closed in 1960. On 8 October of that year, car 513, ran specially decorated in the final procession; so too did sister tram 510, now preserved by the National Tramway Museum at Crich.|$|E

40|$|Abstract —This paper {{describes}} an optimal regenerative braking control scheme {{for a permanent}} magnet brushless DC motor to achieve goals of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> with energy regeneration. During the braking period, the proposed method only changes the switching sequence of the inverter to control the inverse torque so that the braking energy {{will return to the}} battery. Compared with the presented methods, the proposed solution simultaneously achieves dual goals of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> and the energy regeneration without using additional converter, ultra capacitor, or complex winding-changeover technique. Since the braking kinetic energy is converted into the electrical energy and then returns to the battery, the energy regeneration could increase the efficiency of BLDCM drive.

50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the bogie pivot centre. Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. <b>Electric</b> <b>braking</b> is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|E
50|$|The Class 19E was {{the first}} South African AC {{locomotive}} to incorporate regenerative as well as rheostatic <b>electric</b> <b>braking.</b> While regenerative braking was used on all South African 3 kV DC mainline locomotives dating back {{all the way to}} the introduction of the Class 1E in 1925, the notable exception being the Class 18E, all earlier 25 kV and 50 kV AC South African locomotives made use of rheostatic braking only.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} had six DC traction motors. The main {{armature current}} {{for all the}} motors is fed from a common thyristor drive, whilst each motor has an independent field current controller. The field current controllers comprised a two quadrant chopper inside a thyristor bridge. The bipolar transistor based choppers provides a fast fine control of motor torque for <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> and slip control, whilst the thyristor bridge is used to invert the field current polarity.|$|E
5000|$|The four {{electric}} traction motors are force-ventilated, 2070 V (phase difference) 600 A three-phase induction motors weighing 2.550 t; the motors have an integrated reduction gear and are bogie-mounted. Each of the traction motors has a separate inverter. Dynamic rheostatic electrical braking effort is dissipated through electronically switched resistances {{connected to the}} DC link. A maximum braking force of 130 kN is achieved from 30 to 80 km/h, above 80 km/h <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is limited to [...] When operating under 25 kV AC, the electrical circuit allows regenerative braking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} can accelerate {{at a rate}} of [...] Their permissible {{maximum speed}} is 90 km/h. The electric brake can slow the vehicles at a similar rate of 0.8 m/s², down to 20 km/h. At that point, the vehicle switches automatically to the electropneumatic brake, to compensate for the declining <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> performance. The electric brake is also designed for continuous loading, which occurs in applications such as persistent braking of a fully loaded train on a 4.5 ‰ slope (e.g. Davos - Küblis). The vehicles' output per hour is [...] at 45 km/h.|$|E
50|$|Because more {{electric}} locomotives were required {{as a result}} of the expansion of the network and the increase in traffic, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft issued a follow-on order for twelve E 91s in 1927 to cover the most pressing requirements. The locomotives were to be equipped with an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> for hauling heavy trains on long inclines. In addition the original design had to be changed in order to save weight. As a platform for testing the <b>electric</b> <b>brake,</b> locomotive E 95 02 was equipped with it on delivery.|$|R

50|$|In London, the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 was followed by the 1935-40 New Works Programme. For sub-surface lines this involved an investment in rolling stock. For the new Metropolitan line the T Stock standardised the newer compartment stock Metropolitan EMUs; older wooden-bodied stock, with hand operated sliding doors, was replaced by new O Stock and P Stock. These had air-operated sliding doors and used a new Metadyne control system and <b>electric</b> <b>braking.</b> In 1938 Q Stock was built by replacing the District line EMU wooden trailers with new steel ones and equipping the trains with air-operated sliding doors and electro-pneumatic brakes. Also in 1938 the tube standard stock was replaced by 1,121 new cars of 1938 Stock with the control equipment under the car floor, thus giving 14% more capacity.|$|E
50|$|A {{hybrid vehicle}} {{drivetrain}} uses electrical retardation {{to assist the}} mechanical brakes, while recycling the energy. The electric traction motor acts as a generator to charge the battery. The power stored in the battery is available to help the vehicle accelerate. Regenerative braking and eddy current braking are separate types of <b>electric</b> <b>braking.</b> Regenerative braking might not be classified as a retarder as it uses no extra physical hardware {{in addition to the}} existing rotor/stator pair of the motor. It effectuates braking by using the electric field created by the rotational inertia in the rotor/stator that is delivered into the rotor by the momentum of the vehicle(wheels). Additional circuitry in the controller is used to manage this current flow from the stator windings into the battery, some of which dissipates as heat within the circuitry of the controller.|$|E

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule <b>braking,</b> the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> must be activated at all times by use of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive <b>electric</b> AMRE <b>brake</b> were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|R
50|$|Standard Lo-V cars also {{simplified}} braking for train crews. On IRT equipment, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> {{could be}} utilized to synchronize a braking effort and apply each car's brakes simultaneously and uniformly throughout the train. This {{was different from}} operating strictly using air (pneumatically), which was less responsive, but would still stop the train albeit more slowly. Lo-V cars simplified the braking process. On earlier IRT equipment, the braking notches were different for a motorman depending {{on whether or not}} he was operating electrically or pneumatically. On Lo-V cars, the notches were identical regardless of whether or not the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was active. The braking system on a Lo-V car is known as AMUE.|$|R
