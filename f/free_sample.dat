25|$|The Arcane Teachings: <b>Free</b> <b>Sample</b> Lesson. Chicago. McClurg, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second edition}} was {{expanded}} to include three 'supplementary teachings' in pamphlet form. The four titles in this edition were: The Arcane Teaching (hardback), The Arcane Formulas, or Mental Alchemy (pamphlet), The Mystery of Sex, or Sex Polarity (pamphlet), and Vril, or Vital Magnetism (pamphlet). This edition was published by A. C. McClurg—the same publisher who brought out the Tarzan the Ape-Man series by Edgar Rice Burroughs—under the [...] "Arcane Book Concern" [...] imprint, {{and the name of}} the publisher, A. C. McClurg, doesn't actually appear anywhere upon the books in this edition. The series bears a 1909 copyright mark, listing the copyright holder as [...] "Arcane Book Concern". There also appears to have been a pamphlet entitled <b>Free</b> <b>Sample</b> Lesson which was published under the [...] "Arcane Book Concern" [...] imprint, indicating that it may have appeared concurrently with this edition.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2004, Trevin and Melanie Skeens of Maryland, who {{had bought}} the album for their thirteen-year-old daughter, filed a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart after hearing the word [...] "fuck" [...] sung during the song [...] "Thoughtless", a cover of a Korn song. The lawsuit claimed that while the album {{contained}} this explicit word, there was no Parental Advisory sticker on the package. It also claimed that this album violated Wal-Mart's policy of not stocking music with explicit lyrics, and {{that the company had}} {{to be aware of the}} problem because the word was dubbed out of a <b>free</b> <b>sample</b> on the Walmart.com website. The lawsuit was resolved by court order of a deal which would allow those people who bought the album at a Maryland Wal-Mart location to receive a refund. Some copies have the Parental Advisory notice, yet other copies are still sold without it now.|$|E

50|$|It {{is argued}} that a benefit to <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> is the “try it before you buy it” approach. <b>Free</b> <b>samples</b> give {{immediate}} access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away. Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having {{to spend money on}} a filled prescription at a pharmacy.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>free</b> <b>sample</b> or [...] "freebie" [...] is {{a portion}} of food or other product (for example beauty products) given to {{consumers}} in shopping malls, supermarkets, retail stores, or through other channels (such as via the Internet). Sometimes samples of non-perishable items are included in direct marketing mailings. The purpose of a <b>free</b> <b>sample</b> is to acquaint the consumer with a new product, and {{is similar to the}} concept of a test drive, in that a customer is able to try out a product before purchasing it.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of information technology {{and the emergence of}} electronic market places, great business opportunities are created with reduced spatial restraints, lowered search costs, and increased diversity. Marketing practitioners have long been seeking ways {{to take advantage of the}} burgeoning technologies. As one of the most commonly utilized marketing tools, <b>free</b> <b>sampling</b> also has its online presence, especially for information goods that can be digitalized with ease nowadays. However, despite its wide adoption, <b>free</b> <b>sampling</b> has attracted little attention. In this article, we provide an analytical model to study the economic rationale behind <b>free</b> <b>samples.</b> We argue that with {{the development}} of computer technologies, even a less sophisticated Internet user can be an information provider nowadays. As a result, a "free sample" is less and less under control of a seller. In the context of our analytical framework, we find that this trend does not always hurt the seller. On the contrary, under certain circumstances, the monopolistic seller can be better off with the presence of the <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> provided by third parties. We further include advertising into our model. Based on our analysis, we argue that the decreasing search costs for <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> threaten the effectiveness of advertising.

40|$|Much {{research}} {{has gone into}} why it’s poor practice for physicians to accept “gifts, ” and how this puts patients in secondary positions of priority. However, even the most upstanding and unbiased physicians {{find it difficult to}} turn down <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> of medication. There are many reasons why physicians could believe that this service is to their patients benefit. <b>Free</b> <b>samples</b> are a way for uninsured and underinsured patients to receive medication. Samples provide all patients, indigent or affluent, a way to test drugs for side effects and correct dosages before costly prescriptions are filled at the pharmacy. <b>Free</b> <b>samples</b> also allow for immediate treatment of symptoms between pharmacy trips, and allow doctors to see the effects of “new ” and “innovative ” drugs. So why speak out against such a valuable resource? This paper will discuss the impacts, implications, and influence <b>free</b> <b>samples</b> have on our profession. “I’m overworked. I’m underpaid. I’m besieged on all sides by insurance companies. The only solace I get all day is a sales rep taking me to dinner and not complaining about anything. ...|$|R
