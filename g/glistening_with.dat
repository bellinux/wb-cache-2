5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both <b>glistening</b> <b>with</b> sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
25|$|It {{should always}} be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was {{practically}} universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was {{the effect of these}} old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate gesso diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles <b>glistening</b> <b>with</b> gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster.|$|E

"Short of stature, heavily built, {{with head}} sitting awkwardly on his body, with brown eyes <b>glistening</b> <b>with</b> intelligence, {{he was a}} skeptic, a cynic and a pessimist who took the gloomiest view of the future.

2500|$|On the {{day before}} the killing, Chapman accosted singer-songwriter James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station. According to Taylor, [...] "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was <b>glistening</b> <b>with</b> maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about {{what he was going to}} do and his stuff with how John was {{interested}} and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon."

And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E
