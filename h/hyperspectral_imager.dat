The United States military has an interest in the utility of <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imagers</b> for a multitude of tactical and strategic purposes.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the quality parameters of crops requires a spectral range from 400  nm to 2500  nm (Kawamura et al., 2010, Thenkabail et al., 2002). Presently the hyperspectral imaging systems that cover this wavelength range consist of several separate <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imagers</b> and the system weight is from 5 to 15  kg. In addition {{the cost of the}} Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) cameras is high (  50  k€). VTT has previously developed compact <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imagers</b> for drones and Cubesats for Visible and Very near Infrared (VNIR) spectral ranges (Saari et al., 2013, Mannila et al., 2013, Näsilä et al., 2016). Recently VTT has started to develop a hyperspectral imaging system that will enable imaging simultaneously in the Visible, VNIR, and SWIR spectral bands. The system can be operated from a drone, on a camera stand, or attached to a tractor. The targeted main applications of the DroneKnowledge hyperspectral system are grass, peas, and cereals. In this paper the characteristics of the built system are shortly described. The system was used for spectral measurements of wheat, several grass species and pea plants fixed to the camera mount in the test fields in Southern Finland and in the green house.

40|$|The central {{problem of}} temperature-emissivity {{separation}} {{is that we}} obtain N spectral measurements of radiance and need to find N + 1 unknowns (N emissivities and one temperature). To solve this problem {{in the presence of}} the atmosphere we need to find even more unknowns: N spectral transmissions {tau}{sub atmo}({lambda}) up-welling path radiances L{sub path}{up_arrow}({lambda}) and N down-welling path radiances L{sub path}{down_arrow}({lambda}). Fortunately there are radiative transfer codes such as MODTRAN 3 and FASCODE available to get good estimates of {tau}{sub atmo}({lambda}), L{sub path}{up_arrow}({lambda}) and L{sub path}{down_arrow}({lambda}) in the order of a few percent. With the growing use of <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imagers,</b> e. g. AVIRIS in the visible and short-wave infrared there is hope of using such instruments in the mid-wave and thermal IR (TIR) some day. We believe that this will enable us to get around using the present temperature - emissivity separation (TES) algorithms using methods which take advantage of the many channels available in <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imagers.</b> The first idea we had is to take advantage of the simple fact that a typical surface emissivity spectrum is rather smooth compared to spectral features introduced by the atmosphere. Thus iterative solution techniques can be devised which retrieve emissivity spectra {epsilon} based on spectral smoothness. To make the emissivities realistic, atmospheric parameters are varied using approximations, look-up tables derived from a radiative transfer code and spectral libraries. By varying the surface temperature over a small range a series of emissivity spectra are calculated. The one with the smoothest characteristic is chosen.
