50|$|The {{investigation}} found the propellers oversped because the Captain pulled the power levers through the flight idle gate {{and into the}} ground beta range during flight. This was prohibited by the Aircraft Flight Manual. Although a 'beta lockout' mechanism did exist for DHC-8-100,-200, and -300 series aircraft which prevented the propellers from going into reverse even if the power levers were moved into the beta range during flight, this mechanism was only required by regulation to be installed in DHC-8 aircraft operating in the USA. It was not required to be fitted to DHC-8 aircraft in Papua New Guinea, {{and it was not}} fitted to MCJ. If a beta lockout mechanism had been installed on the aircraft, the double propeller overspeed would not have occurred when the power levers were moved below the flight <b>idle</b> <b>range</b> and in the ground beta range during flight. Installation of this mechanism is now mandatory on DHC-8 aircraft worldwide by 19 June 2016. If the pilots had followed the standard emergency procedures detailed in company manuals, they would have given themselves more time to manage the emergency, consider their options, and carry out the approach and forced landing.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{a first step}} in the subject Synchronous {{rectification}} for automotive generators has been done. After an examination of the physical generator basics, two rectification techniques, the diode and the synchronous MOSFET ones, have been researched. The influence of the synchronous rectification on the electrical machine and a detailed examination of the power losses generated in the electrical machine with both rectification techniques take center stage. In order to graphically represent these differences, data field measurements have been carried out: by these means, the efficiency, the power losses and the output power could be estimated along the whole operating range of the electrical machine. The so determined differences in power losses for both of the systems build up the basics for the investigation of the vehicle fuel consumption. Thus, the fuel consumption benefits have been theoretically evaluated, simulated and in a prototype vehicle measured. With the aid of these vehicle measures, it has been possible to prove that the calculated variation in power losses actually bring a fuel consumption reduction in the vehicle. The order of magnitude of the fuel savings has been appreciable for the test cycle NEFZ, as well as for costumer relevant driving cycles (city, overland or mixed). An additional benefit of the synchronous rectification when implemented in the vehicle is also significant: the maximal output power of the generator is largely increased in the <b>idle</b> <b>range.</b> Through this, the generator size installed in the vehicle could be smaller, what could partially compensate the additional costs of the synchronous rectifier...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 This {{thesis is}} a study of certain costs {{relevant}} to the repair of process line equipment. A specific production configuration is studied through computer simulation and statistics. The significance of the simulated costs are investigated and related to practical production problems. Costs relevant to the "permanent repair" of production equipment on the single-channel of an n-one-n production configuration are examined. A piece of equipment {{is assumed to be}} "permanently repaired" if it is modified or replaced, thus halting the breakdowns previously plaguing the machine. An n-one-n production configuration is a group of process lines (multi-channel), each manufacturing the same product, supplying a single process line (single-channel) with raw materials which in turn are used to supply dependent multi-channel process lines downstream with raw materials. Costs deemed important to the permanent repair of single-channel production equipment are: 1. the cost of breakdown repair, 2. the cost of single-channel idle time, 3. the cost of downstream multi-channel idle time due to single-channel breakdowns, and 4. the cost of additional in-process inventory required to prevent the costs of (2) and (3). Computer simulation is used to analyze the impact of single-channel breakdowns. The computer model simulates levels of single-channel <b>idle</b> time, <b>ranging</b> from 50...|$|R
40|$|Allowing the nodes of a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) to turn their radio off periodically noticeably increases network lifetime. Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes {{at the price of}} longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufficient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node <b>idling.</b> However, the <b>range</b> of current WUR prototypes is still significantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redefined to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on...|$|R
