It samples different sets form the training set, trains base learners {{based on these}} different sample sets, and combines the base learners to produce a good result. RF is an <b>expansion</b> of <b>Bagging</b> technique that builds lots of decision trees for training and outputs the most-voting class. It introduces the random attribute selective to make stronger generalization.|$|R

The design allows <b>expansion</b> of <b>bags</b> to remain on the shoot during high winds and let the shoot grow within it. The cover is transparent to enable workers to observe developmental stages. The cover material is vapour permeable to prevent unwanted condensation from destroying transparency and to discourage the growth of mildew, fungus and bacteria.However, bags have been patented for protecting the fruit, vegetables and small plants by Kollath and Huffman (2000). These bags are made of perforated materials passing sunlight, water and air but having perforations sufficiently large to exclude insects. Guthrie (1988) patented bag for processing fruit or vegetables especially the apple fruit.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ease of {{insertion}} between rotational laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion and Brain 2 ̆ 7 s LMA insertion technique in terms of number of LMA insertion attempts, time duration of LMA insertion and complications: trauma, laryngospasm, and hypoxaemia. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from September 2006 to May 2007. METHODOLOGY: One hundred ASA I and II adults undergoing short elective surgical procedures requiring general anaesthesia with spontaneous breathing were enrolled. Following pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 mug/kg. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} study groups: rotational-(R) and standard-(S). LMA insertion was performed when patients became apnoeic and adequate LMA insertion depth achieved. Successful placement was confirmed by chest <b>expansion,</b> reservoir <b>bag</b> movement and appearance of capnographic tracing in both spontaneously breathing patients and in apnoeic patients with assisted ventilation. RESULTS: Significant differences were not seen in patient 2 ̆ 7 s demographics, Mallampati score, ASA status and pre-operative vital signs. Statistically insignificant difference was found for the time duration and number of LMA insertion attempts. The incidence of trauma was significantly noted in standard insertion technique (28...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-'- A {{two-dimensional}} transient {{computer program}} developed for fluidization {{was used to}} study the uniformity of powders injected into rectangular cavities. Most configurations gave very non-uniform powder distributions. Simulation of a leak present in the experimental bag experiments produced a jet expansion not unlike that observed in photographic records. Simula-tions with 5, 30 and 200 micron powders showed that the jet expansion was most pronounced with 5 -micron powders, and that the powder distribution was the most uniform of the configurations studied. A comparison of experimental concentration contours obtained from the high-speed photographic records of powder injection showed a reason-ably good agreement with the theory. The agreement is considered good, because the theory has no fitted parameters. It is predictive. Discrep-ancies between the theoretical and experimental results may be qualita-tively accounted for by <b>bag</b> <b>expansion</b> and a reduced pressure in the bag d l due to leaks. S*. N...|$|R

40|$|Bagging is {{a device}} {{intended}} {{for reducing the}} prediction error of learning algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, ap-plies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and then averages the resulting prediction rules. We investigate bagging in a simplified situation: the prediction rule produced by a learning algorithm {{is replaced by a}} simple real-valued statistic of i. i. d. data. We extend the definition of bagging from statistics (defined on samples) to statistical functionals (defined on distributions), and we study the von Mises <b>expansion</b> of <b>bagged</b> statistical functionals. We show that a bagged functional is smooth {{in the sense that the}} von Mises expansion is finite of length 1 + resample size M. The resample size may be different from the original sample size N; it acts as a smoothing parameter, where smaller M means more smoothing. We then study the effects of bagging on U-statistics. U-statistics of high order can describe complex dependencies, and yet they admit a rigorous asymptotic analysis. We show that bagging U-statistics often but not always decreases variance, whereas it always increases bias. The most striking finding, however, is an equivalence between bagging based on re-sampling with and without replacement: the respective resample sizes Mwith = αwithN and Mw/o = αw/oN produce very similar bagged statistics if αwith = αw/o/(1 − αw/o). While our derivation is limited to U-statistics, the equivalence seems to be universal. We illustrate this point in simulations where bagging is applied to cart trees...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} an improved technique for expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on the WAVE Bioreactor system with perfusion and tube-welding techniques. Our hypothesis was that the bioreactor would allow for optimized provision of nutrients and removal of spent media while minimizing culture volumes. These refinements might lead to a better quality of expanded cells with lower amounts of exhausted cells compared to static <b>expansions</b> in culture <b>bags.</b> PROCEDURES: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from 4 melanoma patients were expanded and compared in parallel using either the WAVE Bioreactor 2 / 10 System or traditional static culture methods. The parameters viability, final cell number, phenotype and effector function were measured. RESULTS: Our results show that the bioreactor system with perfusion is suitable for large-scale expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and allows for higher cell densities and absolute cell numbers as compared to static culture conditions. Phenotypic characteristics of TILs were compared pre and post expansion and showed no consistent difference between the two expansion methods. TILs harvested had the phenotype and function corresponding to intermediate to late effector cells. The system allows one technician to operate several bioreactors simultaneously, thereby reducing the labor for one expansion to approximately 1 / 3 compared to static expansion. DISCUSSION: The WAVE Bioreactor system is suitable for large-scale expansion of TILs. Due to constant perfusion of fresh media and removal of spent media much higher cell densities were achieved while the culture volume and the glucose and glutamine levels were kept constant. Expansion of TILs in the bioreactor system represents a labor- and cost-effective method to reach large numbers of T cells for adoptive cell transfer therapy in the clinic. CONCLUSION: The system presented herein offers an effective alternative to large-scale production of cell products for clinical use while meeting requirements of therapeutic cell quantities and qualities of current protocols for treatment of malignant melanoma...|$|R
40|$|Spray flows are a {{difficult}} problem {{within the realm}} of fluid mechanics because of the complicated interfacial physics involved. Complete models of sprays having even the simplest geometries continue to elude researchers and practitioners. From an experimental viewpoint, measurement of dynamic spray characteristics is made difficult by the optically dense nature of many sprays. Flow features like ligaments and droplets break off the bulk liquid volume during the atomization process and often occlude each other in images of sprays. In this thesis, two important types of sprays are analyzed. The first is a round liquid jet in a cross flow of air, which applies, for instance, to fuel injection in jet engines and the aerial spraying of crops. This flow is studied using traditional high-speed imaging in {{what is known as the}} bag breakup regime, in which partial bubbles that look like bags are formed along the downstream side of the liquid jet due to the aerodynamic drag exerted on it by the cross flow. Here, a new instability is discovered experimentally involving the presence of multiple bags at the same streamwise position along the jet. The dynamics of <b>bag</b> <b>expansion</b> and upstream column wavelengths are also investigated experimentally and theoretically, with experimental data having found to generally follow the scaling arguments predicted by the theory. The second flow that is studied is the atomization of an unsteady turbulent sheet of water in air, a situation encountered in the formation and breakup of ship bow waves. To better understand these complicated flows, the emerging light field imaging (LFI) and synthetic aperture (SA) refocusing techniques are combined to achieve three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the unsteady spray flow fields. A multi-camera array is used to capture the light field and raw images are reparameterized to digitally refocus the flow field post-capture into a volumetric image. These methods allow the camera array to effectively "see through" partial occlusions in the scene. It is demonstrated here that flow features, such as individual droplets and ligaments, can be located in 3 D by refocusing throughout the volume and extracting features on each plane. by Barry Ethan Scharfman.
