40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and Jack Mackerel stock (Trachurus murphyi) in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery <b>data.</b> <b>Jack</b> Mackerel habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of Jack Mackerel, on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of Jack Mackerel as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on Jack Mackerel has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of Jack Mackerel. Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which Jack Mackerel is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for Jack Mackerel, assuming the single stock structure as used within the SPRFMO assessment, has been developed and made available to the SPRFMO Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the Jack Mackerel population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|E

The most notable of these corporations are dataDyne, headed by Zhang Li, and the Carrington Institute, headed by Daniel Carrington. The player is cast as Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father Jack Dark and computer hacker Chandra Sekhar. The team is after Nathan Zeigler, an independent researcher who has been captured by a Hong Kong triad gang led by a man named Killian. Joanna and her father successfully rescue Zeigler, but Killian manages to escape. Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research, which contains information about a dangerous weapon. As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research, Joanna is sent to retrieve it while her father stays with Zeigler. After Joanna retrieved a case with Zeigler's research from a nearby safe house, Zeigler takes a device called a neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research <b>data</b> into <b>Jack's</b> mind. Afterwards, Zeigler succumbs to his injuries sustained by Killian and dies. Before dying, Zeigler says that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll.|$|R
30|$|Building on {{the seminal}} paper by Rauch and Trindade (2002), {{a number of}} {{international}} studies show positive effects of skilled migrants on trade and FDI flows, especially for differentiated goods. For example, Docquier and Lodigiani (2010) also show strong network externalities from large skilled diasporas on FDI inflows to sending countries. Egger et al.

We find very favorable formation enthalpies for these new members of the hcp family, and we present a first-principles-refined model for the crystal structure of the ultrafine Fe(C) precipitates. These findings are useful for the characterization of nano-sized iron carbide precipitates, for understanding their role in the microstructure of steels, and for the design of novel steels having even more desirable properties...|$|R
40|$|Teacher {{judgments}} {{of student learning}} are {{a key element in}} performance assessment. This study examines aspects of the validity of teacher judgments that are based on the Work Sampling System (WSS) ——a curriculum-embedded, performance assessment for preschool (age 3) to Grade 5. The purpose of the study is to determine whether teacher judgments about student learning in kindergarten—third grade are trustworthy if they are informed by a curriculum-embedded performance assessment. A cross-sectional sample composed of 345 K— 3 students enrolled in 17 classrooms in an urban school system was studied. Analyses included correlations between WSS and an individually-administered psychoeducational battery, four-step hierarchical regressions to examine the variance in students spring outcome scores, and Receiver-Operating-Curve (ROC) characteristics to compare the accuracy of WSS in categorizing students in terms of the outcome. Results demonstrate that WSS correlates well with a standardized, individually administered psychoeducational battery; that it is a reliable predictor of achievement ratings in Kindergarten—Grade 3; and that the data obtained from WSS have significant utility for discriminating accurately between children who are at-risk (e. g., Title I) and those not atrisk. Further discussion concerns the role of teacher judgment in assessing student learning and achievement. 1 We acknowledge the invaluable assistance of Sandi Koebler of the University of Pittsburgh and Carolyn Burns of the University of Michigan in collecting and coding these <b>data</b> and <b>Jack</b> Garrow for assisting us with school district data.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{information on}} various macro environmental variables available since 1876 for the Southeast Pacific and more recent <b>data</b> on <b>Jack</b> mackerel Trachurus murphyi (Nichols, 1920) landings and biomass in the Peruvian sea, relating them to probable areas of water masses equivalent to Cold Coastal Waters (CCW) and Subtropical Surface Waters (SSW). It is {{concluded that the}} index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) presents expressions of variability {{that are consistent with}} those found for the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and that the detected changes in biomass of Jack mackerel T. murphyiin the Peruvian sea reflect changes in the availability of the fish stock associated with secular (SOI) and decadal (PDO) variability patterns. These fluctuations in stock availability impact fisheries in Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile, which show significant variations in their landings and would have given a biased picture of the state of abundance, leading to wrong diagnoses of the real situation of the exploited stocks. These patterns of variability would also affect the appearance of El Niño, making them start in the southern hemisphere autumn or spring depending on whether the current PDO is positive or negative. Periods of high (1876 – 1925 and 1976 – 2012) and low (1926 – 1975) variability are also identified in relation to the Euclidean distance of the variances of the SOI; and in relation to the PDO a distinction is made between warm (1925 – 1944 and 1975 – 1994), cold (1945 – 1974) and tempered or interface periods (1895 – 1924 and 1995 – 2012), the latter being explained by the interaction between periods of high variability...|$|R

40|$|While {{much money}} and effort has been spent by {{manufacturers}} and users of pipe jacking equipment to develop suitable techniques, this work {{appears to be the}} first to study the method at full scale, in a scientific research programme. It has involved monitoring a series of five pipe jacks during construction. In each case a heavily instrumented pipe was incorporated into the pipe string to measure pipe joint stresses, pipe and joint compressions and contact stresses between pipe and ground. Total jacking loads and movements of the pipe string were also measured and all results correlated with a detailed site log, full tunnel alignment surveys, and observed ground conditions. The success of the site monitoring has been highly dependent upon the development of a suitable instrumentation and data acquisition system in conjunction with appropriate site procedures for working in the restricted and physically demanding pipe jack environment without undue disruption to normal site operations. The build up of total jacking force is the result of highly complex soil-pipe interaction. The local interface stresses are essentially frictional in most ground conditions, and can be related to the shear strength of the ground. The problem is in determining the effective radial stresses which are affected by soil insitu stresses, stiffness and strength; groundwater conditions; rate of progress; pipeline misalignment and use of lubricants. Relations between pressure distributions at pipe joints and measured tunnel alignments are presented. That small angular deviations between successive pipes cause severe localisation of stresses on their ends is clearly demonstrated. Careful back analysis shows that the linear stress approach of the Concrete Pipe Association of Australia can adequately match the measured stresses and could be used by pipe manufacturers to provide design <b>data</b> on allowable <b>jacking</b> forces for pipes on the basis of pipe size, packer properties, concrete strength and angular alignment. It is also clear from the small pipe barrel stresses that improved packing materials would allow more of the potential strength of pipes to be achieved. Since relative angular than absolute deviations control transfer mechanisms between pipes, uncritical adherence to specifications based on absolute line and level is counter-productive...|$|R
40|$|JACK is an {{interactive}} graphics program {{developed at the}} University of Pennsylvania that displays and manipulates articulated geometric figures. JACK is typically used to observe how a human mannequin interacts with its environment and what effects body types will have upon {{the performance of a}} task in a simulated environment. Any environment can be created, and any number of mannequins can be placed anywhere in that environment. JACK includes facilities to construct limited geometric objects, position figures, perform a variety of analyses on the figures, describe the motion of the figures and specify lighting and surface property information for rendering high quality images. JACK is supplied with a variety of body types pre-defined and known to the system. There are both male and female bodies, ranging from the 5 th to the 95 th percentile, based on NASA Standard 3000. Each mannequin is fully articulated and reflects the joint limitations of a normal human. JACK is an editor for manipulating previously defined objects known as "Peabody" objects. Used to describe the figures as well as the internal data structure for representing them, Peabody is a language with a powerful and flexible mechanism for representing connectivity between objects, both the joints between individual segments within a figure and arbitrary connections between different figures. Peabody objects are generally comprised of several individual figures, each one a collection of segments. Each segment has a geometry represented by PSURF files that consist of polygons or curved surface patches. Although JACK does not have the capability to create new objects, objects may be created by other geometric modeling programs and then translated into the PSURF format. Environment files are a collection of figures and attributes that may be dynamically moved under the control of an animation file. The animation facilities allow the user to create a sequence of commands that duplicate the movements of a human figure in an environment. Integrated into JACK is a set of vision tools that allow predictions about visibility and legibility. The program is capable of displaying environment perspectives corresponding to what the mannequin would see while in the environment, indicating potential problems with occlusion and visibility. It is also possible to display view cones emanating from the figure's eyes, indicating field of view. Another feature projects the environment onto retina coordinates which gives clues regarding visual angles, acuity and occlusion by the biological blind spots. A retina editor makes it possible to draw onto the retina and project that into 3 -dimensional space. Another facility, Reach, causes the mannequin to move a specific portion of its anatomy to a chosen point in space. The Reach facility helps in analyzing problems associated with operator size and other constraints. The 17 -segment torso makes it possible to set a figure into realistic postures, simulating human postures closely. The JACK application software is written in C-language for Silicon Graphics workstations running IRIX versions 4. 0. 5 or higher and is available only in executable form. Since JACK is a copyrighted program (copyright 1991 University of Pennsylvania), this executable may not be redistributed. The recommended minimum hardware configuration for running the executable includes a floating-point accelerator, an 8 -megabyte program memory, a high resolution (1280 x 1024) graphics card, and at least 50 Mb of free disk space. <b>JACK's</b> <b>data</b> files take up millions of bytes of storage space, so additional disk space is highly recommended. The standard distribution medium for JACK is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic IRIX tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. JACK was originally developed in 1988. Jack v 4. 8 was released for distribution through COSMIC in 1993...|$|R
