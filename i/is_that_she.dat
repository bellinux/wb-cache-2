5|$|Some {{aspects of}} Nancy's {{portrayal}} have remained relatively constant through the decades. Arguably her most characteristic physical depiction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is shown holding a flashlight.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E

60|$|The {{implication}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> preferred Bland's society, {{and he was}} gratified.|$|R
60|$|All <b>she</b> knew <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> loved Luke: and all <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{conveyed}} {{to him by}} <b>that</b> look, <b>was</b> just love.|$|R
5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body {{was said to}} have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another is that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E
5|$|My {{interpretation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> isn’t {{trying to}} keep the secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Pericles, {{following}} Athenian custom, {{was first}} married {{to one of}} his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, but around 445BC, Pericles divorced his wife. He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> came to <b>that</b> jungle when pandava {{passed through}} Vanavas.|$|R
50|$|Khloé {{gradually}} {{stepped into}} {{her role as}} project manager after several hours of people talking over each other. However, the consensus among her team <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did quite well, even though it <b>was</b> acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> famous for virtually nothing.|$|R
50|$|Jeanne De Wolfe {{was shot}} and killed by the Punisher. Afterwards Spider-Man <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in Kingpin's employ, and the rumour <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the Kingpin's lover. Fisk was later seen {{mourning}} her death, indicating this may definitely be true.|$|R
5|$|Grace's (Debra Messing) {{pregnancy}} prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) {{to have a}} baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), {{to carry}} her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the only reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and Karen revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband.|$|E
5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much she really knew. The events in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{the head}} {{writer of the}} TGS with Tracy Jordan show, brings her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) a budget {{approval}} on the show's planned Mother's Day episode by gathering around its cast and staff mothers. Liz reminds Jack that Mother's Day is coming up, prompting Jack to realize he forgot to send his mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) flowers and informs his office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) to send her flowers, however, Colleen is waiting outside Jack's office door. Colleen's real reason for visiting her son <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together. Colleen is appalled that Jack is dating two women at the same time, and demands that he end it and make a choice between Nancy and Avery.|$|E
60|$|Her fuller {{explanation}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> becoming known {{there as}} the round lady.|$|R
5000|$|After {{contacting}} {{her daughter}} Lee and Lee's boyfriend, Broderick turned herself in to police, never denying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had indeed {{pulled the trigger}} five times. Broderick's explanation at both trials <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had never planned to kill Dan and Linda and <b>that</b> her crime <b>was</b> not premeditated. Her account of the murders at her second trial <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> startled by Linda's screaming, [...] "Call the police!" [...] and immediately fired the gun.|$|R
50|$|A fan {{theory about}} the {{character}} Sunday <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a former Slayer turned vampire.|$|R
5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, {{which was very}} important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with her grand father because her parents were shot when she was very young. She, just like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her biggest difference to Elena <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E
25|$|One of Seymour's notable {{features}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was born}} with heterochromia, making her right eye brown and her left eye green.|$|E
25|$|The last {{mention in}} Lloyd's List of a Pretty Lass, armed ship, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{returned}} to Plymouth from a cruise on 22 May.|$|E
5000|$|In {{connection}} with Du, her neighbor Zhou Shunde, 84 years old, noticed what follows: [...] "Tantine Du was already {{forty years old}} when I was still very small. What I then knew of her <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a follower of Buddhism, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> followed a mode of vegetarianism, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> amicable, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> never annoyed, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> smiling all the time." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{result of}} her {{thinking}} things over <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> went to Susan when the baby woke.|$|R
60|$|Within a {{few hours}} of <b>that</b> {{interview}} <b>she</b> delivered her answer to Cecil, which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had no intention of marrying Dudley.|$|R
25|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about this period in Policarpa's life. What is known <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> worked as a seamstress, and is also believed to have worked as a teacher in a public school.|$|E
25|$|Belle, a {{character}} from Thomas & Friends, is {{loosely based on}} this engine. The difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has water cannons {{on top of her}} tanks (which was clearly an idea by the series producer).|$|E
25|$|Another {{thing to}} mention about Han's studies <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> uses a rather {{small number of}} {{participants}} and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in France or Ho Chi Minh City).|$|E
60|$|Then Lady Milborough {{could not}} clearly bring to her mind what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to remember.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ms. Honeystump" [...] - Curtis's summer-school teacher. The gag <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> attractive, and {{therefore}} distracting to the students.|$|R
60|$|She {{hesitated for}} a moment. She could not {{immediately}} recall what the question <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to decide.|$|R
25|$|Stradivari {{married his}} second wife, Antonia Maria Zambelli, on 24 August 1699. The only {{information}} known about her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was 35 {{at the time}} of the marriage. They had five children from 1700 to 1708—Francesca Maria, Giovanni Battista Giuseppe, Giovanni Battista Martino, Giuseppe Antonio, and Paolo.|$|E
25|$|The legendary Semiramis {{is usually}} {{considered}} a purely mythical figure; however, {{there is evidence}} in Assyrian records suggesting that she may, in fact, be a Greek reflection of Shammuramat. This identification is disputed. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is given that title after death to reflect similarities with an earlier Sumerian deity.|$|E
25|$|La Pola's {{date and}} place of birth are also subject to {{conjecture}} {{in the absence of}} legal documents. The popular version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was born in the municipality of Guaduas, Cundinamarca, between 1790 and 1796. However Rafael Pombo affirmed that she had been born in Mariquita, while José Caicedo Rojas confirmed it as Bogotá.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew then}} what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> hoping for. She {{looked down at}} him and smiled.|$|R
60|$|The {{remark that}} Gwendolen wound her neck {{about more than}} usual this evening was true. But it <b>was</b> not <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might carry out the serpent idea more completely: it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> watched for any chance of seeing Deronda, so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might inquire about this stranger, under whose {{measuring}} gaze she was still wincing. At last her opportunity came.|$|R
60|$|Amenda {{accepted}} her new surroundings with her usual philosophic indifference. On being informed <b>that</b> what <b>she</b> had {{mistaken for a}} linen- press was her bedroom, <b>she</b> remarked <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> one advantage about it, and <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not tumble out of bed, seeing {{there was nowhere to}} tumble; and, on being shown the kitchen, <b>she</b> observed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should like it for two things--one <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could sit in the middle and reach everything without getting up; the other, that nobody else could come into the apartment while she was there.|$|R
