5|$|Leslie meets Ann at the pit {{with the}} rented excavator, which starts filling {{it in with}} dirt. However, they failed to realize Andy was under some tarps in the pit, and he is injured when mounds of dirt fall on him. He is taken to the hospital, where Ann is {{assigned}} as his nurse. An angry Ron (Nick Offerman) tells Leslie the town is now open to a large potential lawsuit from Andy, and he sends her to visit him along with their city attorney Scott (H. Jon Benjamin). Meanwhile, Andy is excited to be near Ann and insists {{it will lead to}} them getting back together, but Ann tells him she is very happy dating Mark, who unlike Andy has a job, apartment and future. A disheartened Andy decides he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money to impress Ann. When Leslie visits, he regretfully tells her he and his attorney Wendell Adams (Chris Tallman) are going to sue Pawnee.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

Wallström presented plans to give greater prominence to European political parties ahead of the 2009 elections and give the parties the ability to run with candidates for Commission President. There was speculation that under this scenario, if he gained backing, Barroso might run as the People's Party candidate in 2009.|$|E

25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who is less important <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the way for everyone who is more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E

A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|E
25|$|Krumm (voiced by David Eccles) – Like {{the rest}} of his family, his eyeballs are not {{attached}} to his body, and are usually carried in his hands; if he requires the use of both hands, he can carry them in his mouth. His most valuable tool in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench, as well as using his eyeballs. A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them back, once {{going so far as to}} make a fake head to keep from losing them. His dad is a mold farmer.|$|E

Meanwhile, Giga's and Ema's marriage is in turmoil as the couple constantly bickers over everything and she soon serves him with divorce papers. This comes as a terrible blow to Giga, weeks after his older sister Jovanka died. Her will is revealed, stipulating that her brother's kids each stand to inherit substantial sums of money under specific conditions: Saša has to find a job, Violeta <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married and celebrate a one-year anniversary, while Boba has to complete his final {{year of high school}} with at least a 4 (very good) grade average.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{has broken}} up with Hunter and has found out that Ciaran is her true birth father, making Killian her half-brother. The council of witches sends Eoife, an elderly witch, to Morgan to ask her for her {{assistance}} for the rescue of the Starlocket coven, which the International Council of Witches thinks the mysterious dark wave will strike next. Morgan <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close to Killian {{to get closer to}} Ciaran so she called Killian to Widow's Vale and asked him to contact Ciaran.

She refuses to hug the same man that killed her mother Maeve Riordan and Angus, her lover, however. Near the end of the book, she shape shifts into a wolf, with Ciaran, and learns his true name, which can control him. Morgan is faced with a choice between the people she loves and the powerful and seemingly dark magick her father can teach her.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{medicine}} is traditionally {{one of the}} most popular courses in Portugal, and therefore {{one of the most}} selective, with some of the highest rated secondary school top students competing with the best of the best for a place in a medicine course. Normally, a student who wants to attend the Medical School (Faculdade de Medicina) at one of the Portuguese public universities which exclusively offer this graduation course, <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> very high grades in the entrance exams (it may include exams in fields like chemistry, biology, and mathematics) and to have done an almost-brilliant secondary school course. Admission marks of the applicants admitted in medicine, are never less than 180 out of 200. Architecture, economics, a number of engineerings, dentistry, law, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine at most public universities, are, in general, another examples of courses which are traditionally the most selective or popular. In contrast with these, like in any other educational system in the world, there are many courses offered by private universities, polytechnic institutes, and public universities, where the entrance requirements are sharply below the average. There are also some courses with low or even no demand and condemned to be extinguished.|$|E

25|$|In India, the {{practice}} of a hunger protest, where the protestor fasts {{at the door of}} an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of {{the practice}} prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it. This Indian practice is ancient, going back to around 400 to 750 BC. This can be known since it appears in the Ramayana, which was composed around that time. The actual mention appears in the Ayodhya kanda (the second book of the Ramayana), in Sarga (section) 103. Bharata has gone to ask the exiled Rama to come back and rule the kingdom. Bharata tries many arguments, none of which work, at which point he decides to do a hunger strike. He announces his intention to fast, calls for his charioteer Sumantra to bring him some sacred Kusha grass (which Sumantra won't do, since he's too busy looking at Rama's face, so Bharata <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the grass himself), and lies down upon the grass in front of Rama. Rama, however, is quickly able to persuade him to abandon the attempt. Rama mentions it as a practice of the brahmanas.|$|E
