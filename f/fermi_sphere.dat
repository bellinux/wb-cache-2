In this state, the deformed <b>Fermi</b> <b>spheres</b> of neutrons and protons increase the pairing probabilities along the axis of symmetry breaking near the average Fermi surface. We find that the state possesses lower free energy and larger gap value than the angle-averaged gap state at large isospin asymmetries. These properties are mainly caused by the coupling of different m_{j} components of the pairing gap.

5000|$|Exotic SCQSL's {{are formed}} with such {{hypothetical}} particles as fermionic spinons carrying spin 1/2 and no charge. The {{experimental studies of}} Herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 single crystal have {{found no evidence of}} long range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that Herbertsmithite is the promising system to investigate SCQSL. The planes of the Cu2+ ions can be considered as two-dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension. Experiments have found neither long range magnetic order nor glassy spin freezing down to temperature 50 mK making Herbertsmithite the best candidate for QSL realization. Frustration of a simple kagome lattice leads to dispersionless topologically protected flat bands.

Herbertsmithite represents a fascinating example of SCI where particles-spinons, non-existing as free, replace the initial particles appearing in the Hamiltonian and define the thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures. Because of the spin-charge separation, heat transport, thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures of the SCI Herbertsmithite are similar to those of heavy-fermion metals rather than of insulators.|$|E
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of a non-relativistic fermionic system with {{imbalanced}} state populations interacting via a short-range S-wave attractive interaction is analyzed {{in the mean}} field approximation. We determine the energetically favored state for different values of the mismatch between the two <b>Fermi</b> <b>spheres</b> in the weak and strong coupling regime considering both homogeneous and non-homogeneous superconductive states. We find that the homogeneous superconductive phase persists for values of the population imbalance that increase with increasing coupling strength. In the strong coupling regime and for large population differences the energetically stable homogeneous phase is characterized by one gapless mode. We also find that the inhomogeneous superconductive phase characterized by the condensate Δ(x) ∼Δ (i q · x) is energetically favored {{in a range of}} values of the chemical potential mismatch that shrinks to zero in the strong coupling regime.

50|$|The {{concept of}} nearly free valence {{electrons}} in metallic alloys explained the special {{stability of the}} Hume-Rothery phases if the <b>Fermi</b> <b>sphere</b> of the sp Valence electron, treated as free, would be scattered by the Brillouin zone boundaries of the atomic structure. The description of the impurities in metals by the Thomas Fermi approximation would explain why such impurities would not interact at long range. Finally the delocalisation of the valence d electrons in transitional metals and alloys would explain the possibility for the magnetic moments of atoms to be expressed as fractions of Bohr magnetons, leading to ferro or antiferromagnetic coupling at short range. This last contribution, produced at the first international conference on magnetism, held in Strasbourg in May 1939, reinforced similar points of view defended {{at the time in}} France by the future Nobel laureate Louis Néel. In 1949, Mott suggested to Jacques Friedel to use the approach developed together with Marvey for a more accurate description of the electric-field screening of the impurity in a metal, leading to the characteristic long range charge oscillations. Friedel also used the concept developed in that book of virtual bound level to describe a situation when the atomic potential considered is not quite strong enough to create a (real) bound level of symmetry e ≠ o. The consequences of these remarks on the more exact approaches of cohesion in rp as well as d metals were mostly developed by his students in Orsay.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of bosonic bound states underlies the {{formation of}} a superfluid ground state in the many-body phase diagram of ultracold Fermi gases. We study bound-state formation in a spin- and mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas confined in a box with hard-wall boundary conditions. Because of the presence of finite <b>Fermi</b> <b>spheres,</b> the center-of-mass momentum of the potentially formed bound states can be finite, depending on the parameters controlling mass and spin imbalance as well as the coupling strength. We exploit this observation to estimate the potential location of inhomogeneous phases in the many-body phase diagram as a function of spin- and mass imbalance as well as the box size. Our results suggest that a hard-wall box does not alter substantially the many-body phase diagram calculated in the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, such a box may serve as an ideal trap potential to bring experiment and theory closely together and facilitate the search for exotic inhomogeneous ground states.

40|$|We {{consider}} a strongly interacting quasi-one dimensional Bose gas {{on a tight}} ring trap subjected to a localized barrier potential. We explore the possibility to form a macroscopic superposition of a rotating and a nonrotating state under nonequilibrium conditions, achieved by a sudden quench of the barrier velocity. Using an exact solution for the dynamical evolution in the impenetrable-boson (Tonks-Girardeau) limit, we find an expression for the many-body wavefunction corresponding to a superposition state. The superposition is formed when the barrier velocity is tuned close to multiples of integer or half-integer number of Coriolis flux quanta. As {{a consequence of the}} strong interactions, we find that (i) the state of the system can be mapped onto a macroscopic superposition of two <b>Fermi</b> <b>spheres,</b> rather than two macroscopically occupied single-particle states as in a weakly interacting gas, and (ii) the barrier velocity should be larger than the sound velocity to better discriminate the two components of the superposition.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study of chiral four-nucleon interactions in nuclear and neutron matter is performed. The leading-order terms arising from pion-exchange {{in combination with}} the chiral 4 π-vertex and the chiral NN 3 π-vertex are found to be very small. Their attractive contribution to the energy per particle stays below 0. 6 MeV in magnitude for densities up to ρ = 0. 4 fm^- 3. We consider also the four-nucleon interaction induced by pion-exchange and twofold Δ-isobar excitation of nucleons. For most of the closed four-loop diagrams the occurring integrals over four <b>Fermi</b> <b>spheres</b> can either be solved analytically or reduced to easily manageable one- or two-parameter integrals. After summing the individually large contributions from 3 -ring, 2 -ring and 1 -ring diagrams of alternating signs, one obtains at nuclear matter saturation density ρ_ 0 = 0. 16 fm^- 3 a moderate contribution of 2. 35 MeV to the energy per particle. The curve E̅(ρ) rises rapidly with density, approximately with the third power of ρ. In pure neutron matter the analogous chiral four-body interactions lead, at the same density ρ_n, to a repulsive contribution that is about half as strong. The present calculation indicates that long-range multi-nucleon forces, in particular those provided by the strongly coupled π N Δ-system with its small mass-gap of 293 MeV, can still play an appreciable role for the equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter.

40|$|We {{consider}} the radially vibrating spherical quantum billiard {{as a representative}} example of vibrating quantum billiards. We derive necessary conditions for quantum chaos in d-term superposition states. These conditions are symmetry relations corresponding to the relative quantum numbers of eigenstates considered pairwise.

Moreover, when these necessary conditions are met, we observe numerically that there always exist parameter values that correspond to chaotic configurations. We focus our numerical studies {{on the ground and}} first excited states of the radially vibrating spherical billiard with null angular momentum eigenstates. We observe chaotic behavior in this configuration, which dispels the common belief that one is required to pass to the semiclassical (ħ⟶ 0) or high quantum number limits in order to meaningfully discuss quantum chaos.
