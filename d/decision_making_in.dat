5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>in</b> uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>in</b> tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E

Hypotheses were developed: H 0 There may not have any significant difference <b>in</b> academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices <b>in</b> public high schools of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. H 1 There may be a significant difference <b>in</b> academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices <b>in</b> public high schools of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

H 1 There may be differences regarding academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices <b>in</b> public high schools of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Two research instruments were self designed: semi structured interview guide was designed for data collection from school heads whereas close ended questionnaire was developed for data collection from the school teachers. The research instruments were found to be reliable and valid. The semi structured interview guide covered same broader areas which were covered in questionnaire so that comparison could be made. Survey method was used to collect data from respondents. The study was descriptive in nature which compared location wise academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices <b>in</b> high schools of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The population of the study consisted of 663 heads masters/mistresses of public high schools from three districts of Punjab and 10, 953 male and female teachers of public high schools from three districts of Punjab. 311 head masters/mistresses of public high schools from three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 3, 997 male and female teachers from three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A sample of 192 respondents, including 48 head masters and 48 head mistresses and 96 teachers (48 male and 48 female) of public high schools were {{selected on the basis of}} simple random sampling technique from three districts of Punjab and three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The data was analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) two- dimensional chi square was applied to find out difference of opinion of the head masters/mistresses of both provinces. Sample independent t test was applied to find opinion of teachers of both provinces. It appears from the data, that academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices <b>in</b> Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are almost the same. This includes <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices regarding overall management of school, student supervision, teacher supervision, role of School Council/PTA, demonstration of lessons and experiments, and community participation. The head masters/mistresses being over all management incharges of the schools have to plan the objectives for the academic year and design the strategy to achieve the objectives. It was found that head masters/mistresses supervised students, organized and coordinated (internal and external) examinations. They are responsible to make decisions for developing skills, interest and aptitudes among students in classroom activities. Head masters/mistresses have to supervise the teachers and provide them professional guidance. Academic <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> practices are used regarding supervision of curricular, co-curricular activities, evaluation and assessment of student achievement, assessing the performance of teachers as well as students. Head masters/mistresses have to make decisions regarding community participation in problem solving at school...|$|R

40|$|<b>Decision</b> <b>making</b> deficits play an {{important}} role in the definition of pathological gambling (PG). However, only few empirical studies are available regarding <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> processes <b>in</b> PG. This study therefore compares <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> processes <b>in</b> PG and normal controls in detail using three <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> tasks examining general performance levels on these tasks as well as feedback processing using reaction time analyses. To investigate the specificity of <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> deficits <b>in</b> PG, a substance dependence group (alcohol dependence; AD) and an impulse control disordered group (Tourette syndrome; TS) were included. The PG group (n = 48), AD group (n 46), TS group (n = 47), and a normal control (NC) group (n = 49) were administered (1) the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), an ecologically valid gambling task; (2) the Card Playing Task, a task measuring perseveration for reward; and (3) a Go/No-Go discrimination task, a task measuring reward and response cost sensitivity. The PG group showed a diminished performance on all tasks and deficient feedback processing as compared to the NC group on the IGT and the Card Playing Task. In general, performance measures were not associated with levels of comorbidity or with self-reported motivational measures. For the larger part, deficiencies <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> processes <b>in</b> the PG group were also present in the AD group, but not in the TS group. Subgroup analyses revealed larger <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> deficits <b>in</b> pathological slot machine gamblers than in pathological casino gamblers.
