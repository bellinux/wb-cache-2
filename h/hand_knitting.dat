25|$|Domestic {{knitting}} machines use the weft knitting method which produces a fabric similar to <b>hand</b> <b>knitting.</b> Knitting proceeds {{more quickly than}} in <b>hand</b> <b>knitting,</b> where (usually two) straight needles are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. Knitting machines work an entire row of loops in a single movement.|$|E

25|$|In the {{historical}} projects, yarn companies provided knitting patterns {{approved by the}} various branches of the armed services; often they were distributed by local chapters of the American Red Cross. Modern projects usually entail the <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> of hats or helmet liners; the liners provided for soldiers must be of 100% worsted weight wool and be crafted using specific colors.|$|E

25|$|Knitting by {{machine is}} done in two {{different}} ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools {{depending on the size}} of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the Cotton yarn.|$|E
25|$|Desert {{tribes and}} Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents, yurts, clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted by color {{and age of}} the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as {{waterproof}} coats for the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods. The fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> or crochet. Pure camel hair is recorded as being used for western garments from the 17th century onwards, and from the 19th century a mixture of wool and camel hair was used.|$|E
25|$|A {{row counter}} for <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> is a tally counter for {{counting}} rows or courses worked, for counting stitch pattern repetitions, or for counting increases or decreases {{of the number}} of stitches in consecutive rows. The first commercially produced one appeared on the market in the 1920s after the general public started regularly knitting from unfamiliar printed and complex patterns. Design variations include on-needle barrel-shaped counters for straight-needle work, stitch-marker counters for knitting on double-pointed and circular needles, complex counters which attempted to assist with decreases, increases and lacework, stand-alone hand-held counters in imitation of the hand-tally, pendant counters worn round the neck and online software for iPhones.|$|E
25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or {{synthetic}} yarn and have less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a <b>hand</b> <b>knitted</b> or <b>hand</b> loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from <b>hand</b> <b>knit.</b> Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium. By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine <b>knit</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>knit</b> is evident.|$|R

2500|$|Machine {{knitting}} saves {{a considerable}} amount of time but does require learning to operate the machines correctly. [...] Most if not all <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> patterns can be worked up on a machine, either identically or in a similar design. <b>Hand</b> <b>knitting</b> patterns are designed to [...] "flip" [...] the fabric on every row so that the knitter consistently uses the dominant hand. However, machine knitting is consistently knit with the fabric facing the same way. Flat Bed machines knit back and forth and Circular machines knit continuously in the round.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>knitting</b> {{garments}} {{for free}} distribution to others has become common practice among <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> groups. Girls and women hand knitted socks, sweaters, scarves, mittens, gloves, and hats for soldiers in Crimea, the American Civil War, and the Boer Wars; this practice continued in World War I, World War II and the Korean War, and continues for soldiers in Iraq [...] and Afghanistan. The Australian charity Wrap with Love continues to provide blankets hand knitted by volunteers to people {{most in need}} {{around the world who}} have been affected by war.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{invention}} of the stocking frame, an early form of knitting machine, knitting [...] "by hand" [...] became a craft used by country people with easy access to fiber. Similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> became a leisure activity for the wealthy.|$|E

50|$|On a hiatus {{from the}} {{entertainment}} business, Bateman established a clothing design company in 2000. She managed it until its closure in 2003. Justine Bateman Designs {{was known for}} one-of-a-kind <b>hand</b> <b>knits.</b> It sold to BendelsNY, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Fred Segal.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2003, wool soakers became {{instantly}} popular, {{which resulted}} in a slew of WAHMs selling <b>hand</b> <b>knit</b> wool covers/soakers. DryBees pocket diapers also hit the scene and quickly became a favorite. In 2004 and 2005, the soakers evolved into wool longies or pants.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> certain {{articles}} of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment {{will be made}} of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together. Seamless knitting, where a whole garment is hand knit as a single piece, is also possible. Elizabeth Zimmermann is probably the best-known proponent of seamless or circular <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> techniques. Smaller items, such as socks and hats, are usually knit in one piece on double-pointed needles or circular needles. Hats in particular can be started [...] "top down" [...] on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added. [...] Care {{must be taken to}} bind off at a tension that will allow the [...] "give" [...] needed to comfortably fit on the head. [...] (See Circular knitting.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Clothing and afghans are {{frequently}} made for children, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged in various countries. Pine Ridge Indian Reservation accepts donations for the Lakota {{people in the}} United States. Prayer shawls, or shawls in which the crafter meditates or says prayers of their faith while <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> with the intent on comforting the recipient, are donated to those experiencing loss or stress. Many knitters today hand knit and donate [...] "chemo caps," [...] soft caps for cancer patients who lose their hair during chemotherapy. Yarn companies offer free knitting patterns for these caps.|$|E
2500|$|The fabric {{produced}} using a {{knitting machine}} is {{of a more}} even texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of plain stockinette stitch, and can be an advantage. [...] Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a knitting machine. [...] Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but still much faster than <b>hand</b> <b>knitting.</b> [...] The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky knitting machine.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Fair Isle or Shetland garments, however, Cowichan sweaters {{are always}} <b>hand</b> <b>knit</b> of thick, handspun, one-ply natural-coloured yarn {{in two or}} three colours (generally cream, black and grey), {{producing}} a warm bulky outer garment that is heavier than the multi-coloured Scottish garments made from lightweight two-ply dyed yarn.|$|R
2500|$|Once the <b>hand</b> <b>knitted</b> {{piece is}} finished, the {{remaining}} live stitches are [...] "cast off". Casting (or [...] "binding") off loops the stitches across {{each other so}} they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item. Although the mechanics are different from casting on, there is a similar variety of methods.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{hundreds}} of different knitting stitches used by hand knitters. A piece of <b>hand</b> <b>knitting</b> begins {{with the process of}} casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle. Different methods of casting on are used for different effects: one may be stretchy enough for lace, while another provides a decorative edging. [...] Provisional cast-ons are used when the knitting will continue in both directions from the cast-on. There are various methods employed to cast on, such as the [...] "thumb method" [...] (also known as [...] "slingshot" [...] or [...] "long-tail" [...] cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for [...] "picking up stitches" [...] and knitting a border; the [...] "double needle method" [...] (also known as [...] "knit-on" [...] or [...] "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then [...] "knitted on," [...] which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more. The number of active stitches remains the same as when cast on unless stitches are added (an increase) or removed (a decrease).|$|E
