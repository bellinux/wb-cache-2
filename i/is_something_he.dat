5|$|Tavares {{has been}} praised by his coaches {{for his ability}} to {{anticipate}} the play since he joined the OHL. A lack of speed had been the most common criticism of Tavares' play, something he spent his junior career attempting to improve. Tavares' skating speed <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> greatly improved since turning professional, and his speed is no longer considered an issue on the ice.|$|E

500|$|The roughly 40-minute {{score was}} {{recorded}} {{in the summer of}} 2006 at Capitol Studios in Hollywood, California. Conti chose to pre-record the string, brass and piano tracks and then have those tracks mixed with the work of a 44 piece orchestra which he conducted. He also performed all of the piano work himself which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> has done with each movie for which he has composed the score. Stallone also was involved in every part of the process and attended several of the recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|According to Adam Badowski, head of CD Projekt RED, {{maintaining}} its independence {{is a company}} priority. They avoided becoming a subsidiary of another company for financial and creative freedom and ownership of their projects. Electronic Arts was rumoured to be attempting to acquire CD Projekt. This was quickly denied by Iwiński, who said that maintaining the company's independence <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> [...] "will be fighting for". One of the core values of the company is open communication. As such, financial details on development, marketing and release costs are freely published.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have {{discussed}} {{the presence of a}} theme, with Milton Savage deducing that [...] "track titles would imply an underlying conceptual framework to Wavering Radiant, with 'Hall of the Dead' preceding 'Ghost Key', and 'Threshold of Transformation' closing the album in epic circumstances – Turner, it seems, has left our world behind for exploration of another beyond the lives led by mortal men." [...] Isis releases have always had a thematic basis; as Andrew Rennie dissects, [...] "Isis's four previous full-lengths have clear story arcs, but Wavering Radiant themes are open to interpretation, giving it added appeal." [...] Over time, Turner has become reluctant to divulge the thematic particulars of any given album and on Wavering Radiant he has been equivocal. The act of explaining the thematic basis of an album erodes Turner's [...] "connection" [...] with the music, and he has spoken of how that relationship <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> [...] "wishes to preserve". He also asserts that retaining this synergy with the music allows him to commit more to the album's live performances. Similarly, he has also spoken of how [...] "eople have a tendency to focus on one narrow aspect of the overall concept or misinterpret it." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The two-silhouette logo is {{inspired}} by, of all things, a highway sign. Ironically, Mahrt was driving to a Metro League game in 2012 [...] thinking out loud {{about his new}} league [...] when he took special notice of the imagery used to demarcate the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had seen countless times, as the signs appear every five miles along the Missouri River. But seen while dreaming about a future business venture, the sign took on a new life. The trail's triangular logo evolved into the circular centerpiece in the Lewis & Clark Baseball League primary wordmark.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Jed Mills, who competed against Alcala as [...] "Bachelor #2", later {{described}} him as a [...] "very strange guy" [...] with [...] "bizarre opinions". [...] Alcala won the contest, and a date with [...] "bachelorette" [...] Cheryl Bradshaw, who subsequently refused {{to go out with}} him, [...] according to published reports, because she found him [...] "creepy". Criminal profiler Pat Brown, noting that Alcala killed Robin Samsoe and at least two other women after his Dating Game appearance, speculated that Bradshaw's rejection might have been an exacerbating factor. [...] "One wonders what that did in his mind", Brown said. [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> would not take too well. [...] don't understand the rejection. They think that something is wrong with that girl: 'She played me. She played hard to get.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics noted, though, {{that history}} as such was {{secondary}} to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly {{by his own}} personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th century characters using mid-19th century moral values. [...] "The life of today seeps through everywhere," [...] Tolstoy himself admitted, speaking of his ballads. According to the author, historical drama had to be [...] "true" [...] only in a [...] "humanist way". [...] "A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it," [...] he wrote. So on the one hand, Tolstoy's dramatic trilogy- The Death of Ivan the Terrible, Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich and Tsar Boris- was not historical {{in the strict sense}} of the word; on the other hand, it was far from being the brand of [...] "patriotic drama" [...] produced by Nestor Kukolnik or the imitation of the French tragedie des allusions which Aleksander Pushkin ridiculed. In fact, Pushkin's attitude was the closest approximation to that of Tolstoy. The latter's plays had their [...] "second levels", directly corresponding to contemporary political situations, but were driven mostly by the author's historical views and theories which involved the glorifying of Russian [...] "noble men" [...] (he associated them with the boyarstvo) and the vilification Ivan Grozny whom the boyarstvo had fallen victim to.|$|E

2500|$|The author makes a {{point of}} {{grounding}} his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward, not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; [...] "If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series." [...] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner, he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} half of Season 6, in [...] "The Parking Spot Escalation" [...] and [...] "The Fish Guts Displacement", Sheldon is pushed further after seeing Amy {{partially}} exposed and taking care of her while she is ill. In the episode [...] "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In [...] "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during [...] "The Love Spell Potential", Amy's and Sheldon's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility. In the Season 7 episode [...] "The Locomotive Manipulation", Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time; though it was more to prove a point, he prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling. A later episode showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy.|$|E
