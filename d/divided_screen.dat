50|$|Castle farm {{is about}} half a mile to the north of Marshfield. In its 2 acre {{farmyard}} is an ancient longhouse with the original fireplace and the <b>dividing</b> <b>screen</b> between the human and animal dwellings. On the neighbouring land where lynchets show in some fields, many Bronze Age and Stone Age implements have been picked up and a skeleton in a stone coffin discovered.|$|R
500|$|Episodes depict Detectives Robert Goren (D'Onofrio) and Alexandra Eames (Erbe) as the squad's lead investigators. Captain James Deakins (Sheridan) is the detectives' direct {{supervisor}} {{and head of}} the Major Case Squad. Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver (Vance) often attempts to obtain confessions from the suspects, rather than taking them to trial. Law & Order: Criminal Intent focuses on the actions and motives of the criminals, and it <b>divides</b> <b>screen</b> time equally between the suspects and victims and the police's investigation.|$|R

50|$|During the 1980s, Tunberg began {{creating}} {{furniture and}} doors. His furniture {{is made of}} exotic hardwoods and inlays and his doors are covered in marquetry cut from wood veneer. In 1987, the 72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill in Venice commissioned Tunberg to create an inlaid sculptural railing that spanned the entire interior of the restaurant. In 1989, the Maple Drive Restaurant in Beverly Hills commissioned Tunberg to create 52 one-of-a-kind inlaid sculptural tables and booths and a combination marquetry piano/room <b>dividing</b> <b>screen.</b> As a result of Tunberg's work for Maple Drive, {{he was awarded the}} 1990 Annual Design Award, Furniture Designer of the Year, by Angeles magazine.|$|R
5000|$|The Warnock {{algorithm}} <b>divides</b> the <b>screen</b> {{into smaller}} areas and sorts triangles within these.

50|$|Diagnostic imaging for MALS is <b>divided</b> into <b>screening</b> and confirmatory tests. A {{reasonable}} {{screening test}} {{for patients with}} suspected MALS is duplex ultrasonography to measure blood flow through the celiac artery. Peak systolic velocities greater than 200 cm/s are suggestive of celiac artery stenosis associated with MALS.|$|R
30|$|Between October 2009 and December 2011 the UCA 1 {{test was}} {{performed}} on collected urine samples from 162 patients <b>divided</b> into <b>screening</b> and follow-up groups, based on the absence or presence of prior bladder cancer. The test performance was then evaluated in each group and compared to cystoscopy and urinary cytology.|$|R
50|$|Up to {{four players}} {{are able to}} play simultaneously, sharing the {{keyboard}} to control their characters (ranger, wizard, barbarian, and female warrior).

50|$|Modern {{computer}} graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, <b>dividing</b> the <b>screen</b> into a rectangular grid of pixels, {{due to the}} relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for blitting operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated to blitting {{is known as a}} Blitter chip.|$|R
40|$|In Voice, Image, Television: Beckett’s <b>Divided</b> <b>Screens</b> Julian Murphet {{makes the}} case for a ‘modernist moment’ in 70 s {{television}} culture, arguing for Samuel Beckett as its great (if somewhat surprising) exemplar. Murphet suggests that the persistence of black and white televisions in British and American living rooms in the 1960 s and 1970 s {{at the same time as}} colour television’s rise to dominance, maps on to a more generally accepted pattern for the relationship between modernism and postmodernism. Through a close of analysis of Beckett’s works for television, Murphet reveals that such pieces as Eh Joe illustrate a televisual modernism that has mostly gone unrecorded by critics. More specifically, in terms of the writer’s creative practice, Murphet examines how through his work for television Beckett methodically investigates the possibilities and limitations of the medium, and in doing so unclogs aesthetic blockages that had beset his own work...|$|R

30|$|Patients were <b>divided</b> into <b>screening</b> and {{follow-up}} groups, based on absence or presence of prior BC. Patients were considered disease-free if the workup was negative and {{no evidence of}} BC {{was found in the}} six following months. Patients with insufficient follow-up were excluded from the study. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the UCA 1 test in both patient groups compared to cystoscopy and cytology.|$|R
50|$|To {{complete}} {{the game in}} single-player mode, the player must defeat the computer on each level four times, each time representing an increasing level of difficulty. When the game is completed, the ending offered differs {{depending on whether the}} player played as the first player (red), or the second player (blue). Two-player mode <b>divides</b> the <b>screen</b> into two playfields. Each player can see the opponent's actions, eliminating any element of surprise.|$|R
5000|$|The visionary French director, Abel Gance, {{used the}} term [...] "Polyvision" [...] to {{describe}} his three-camera, three-projector technique for both widening and <b>dividing</b> the <b>screen</b> in his 1927 silent epic, Napoléon. The filmmaker Brian De Palma has incorporated split screens into many of his films, most notably in Sisters (1973) and they have since become synonymous with his filmmaking style (Specifically 1981's Blow Out and 1998's Snake Eyes).|$|R

50|$|A popular {{theme in}} the VSD {{literature}} is divide and conquer. The Warnock algorithm pioneered <b>dividing</b> the <b>screen.</b> Beam tracing is a ray-tracing approach which divides the visible volumes into beams. Various screen-space subdivision approaches {{reducing the number of}} primitives considered per region, e.g. tiling, or screen-space BSP clipping. Tiling may be used as a preprocess to other techniques. ZBuffer hardware may typically include a coarse 'hi-Z' against which primitives can be rejected early without rasterization, this is a form of occlusion culling.|$|R

We calculate the order g 6 anti-screening contribution from light fermions and demonstrate that these effects introduce a non-local divergence. These divergences are shown to {{make it impossible to}} define a coupling renormalisation scheme that renormalises this minimal, anti-screening potential. Hence the beta function cannot be <b>divided</b> into <b>screening</b> and anti-screening parts beyond lowest order. However, we then demonstrate that renormalisation can be carried out in terms of the anti-screening potential...|$|R

50|$|The {{arrival of}} digital video {{technology}} has made <b>dividing</b> the <b>screen</b> {{much easier to}} accomplish, and recent digital films and music videos have explored this possibility in depth. Sometimes the technique is used to show actions occurring simultaneously; Timecode (2000), by Mike Figgis, is a recent example where the combination is of four real time digital video cameras shown continuously {{for the duration of}} the film. Split-screen can also be used to the extent that it becomes part of the narrative structure of a film, as in The Boston Strangler.|$|R
