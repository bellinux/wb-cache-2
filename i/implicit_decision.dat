An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (<b>implicit)</b> <b>decision</b> to impose canonical models on popular fiction as follows: [...] "If people who read Goethe and Alessandro Manzoni and Pushkin with pleasure are also reading detective fiction with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized", This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction {{on the basis of its}} use of canonized literary fiction, and of the legitimized public's response to it.|$|E

The baptism is the proper way for all people to be saved. The history of salvation is christocentric; everything is focused on Christ and, vice versa Christ turns to every man, accepts every man. Therefore, one can suppose that for every adult who cannot make an explicit decision for Christ, this Christ acceptation together with its <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> is enough for its salvation. On the other side, church prays for those infants who died without being baptized and who could not make neither explicit nor <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> for Christ.

This standard rate was then used to help calculate X. In addition, detailed aspects of the price elements incorporated into the price index {{may be more important}} to the actual operation of a price cap regulatory regime than either the X-factor or the inflation adjustment. How rate elements are incorporated and removed from price caps is particularly important in industries with rapidly changing service offerings.|$|R

The algorithm is guided by the idea to exploit domain-specific characteristics of indoor environments.

However, human–robot interactions may be complicated by a hypothetical Uncanny Valley (UV) in which imperfect human-likeness provokes dislike. Previous investigations using unnaturally blended images reported inconsistent UV effects.

An “investment game” {{showed that the}} UV penetrated even more deeply to influence subjects’ <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> concerning robots’ social trustworthiness, and that these fundamental social decisions depend on subtle cues of facial expression that are also used to judge humans. Preliminary evidence suggests category confusion may occur in the UV but does not mediate the likability effect.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for management information systems design which employs a formalized framework for significantly involving manager-users {{in the design}} process. The process seeks to develop a system design {{on the basis of}} a criterion which considers both technical cost-benefit considerations and the manager's perception of the potential utility of the system. A key element of the methodology is the development of descriptive and normative system models which are based on the concept of a "linear responsibility chart. " These models serve as the basis for the negotiated development of a consensus system model which defines the framework for the decision-oriented analysis of information requirement. The process of information analysis involves joint manager-analyst activities which are aimed at the explication of the <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> models which are used for decision making. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{review of}} the {{literature}} showed that the probability of system success, i. e. user acceptance, system quality and system usage, can be increased by user-developer communication. So far most research on user participation focuses either on early or on late development phases. Especially large IT projects require increased participation, due to their high complexity. We believe that the step in software development when user requirements are translated (and thus interpreted) by developers into a technical specification (i. e. system requirements, architecture and models) is a critical one for user participation. In this step a lot of <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> are taken, some of which should be communicated to the end users. Therefore, we want to create a method that enhances communication between users and developers during that step. We identified trigger points (i. e. changes on initial user requirements), and the granularity level on which to communicate with the end users. Also, representations of changes and adequate means of communication are discussed. Keywords—user-developer communication; task-oriented requirements engineering; rich media theory I...|$|R
40|$|Improving water {{distribution}} system operations {{can be achieved}} {{through the use of}} optimally generated pump schedules by minimizing the overall pumping cost while satisfying the water pressure and flow requirements and subject to all physical constraints. This study is devoted to developing a general methodology to determine the optimal operations of large scale {{water distribution}} systems. Rather than solving the original mixed integer nonlinear programming problem directly, a two-level hierarchical optimization scheme is proposed. The first level is a NLP problem where the decision variables are each pump station's discharge and added head, pump speeds, valve control settings, nodal pressure heads and tank water elevations. At the second level a simple DP or a direct conversion method is applied to find the best pump combinations based on the optimal solutions obtained from the first level NLP optimization. Prior to solving the two level optimization problem, pre-optimization work is performed which produces a lumped energy function for each pump station to approximate the relationship between consumed energy and pump station's added head and discharge. To make the first level NLP problem solvable, a reduction technique is proposed which uses the network simulation model {{to reduce the number of}} constraints and decision variables. This reduction, however, results in a NLP problem with <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> variables which are not directly controlled by the decision variables. One strategy proposed is to consider the constraints of the <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> variables in a penalty term appended to the objective function. The problem is then structured using an augmented Lagrangian algorithm and solved with a NLP code. The second strategy is to use an active set method. The entire NLP problem is solved using successive quadratic programming where only the active constraint set is considered during the solution process of each quadratic programming subproblem. Two case studies were performed to determine the optimal schedules and compare the two NLP approaches. The Lagrangian seemed to perform better when many constraints were initially violated, while the active set method seemed appropriate to solve systems with few initial active constraints...|$|E

Adaptation is generally implicitly {{incorporated in the}} climate change damage functions as used in Integrated Assessment Models. We replace the <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> on adaptation with explicit adaptation in a multi-regional setting by using an adjusted RICE model. We show that making adaptation explicit will not affect the optimal mitigation path when adaptation is set at its optimal level. Sub-optimal adaptation will, however, change the optimal mitigation path. Furthermore this paper studies for different forms of cooperation what effects international adaptation transfers will have on (i) domestic adaptation and (ii) the optimal mitigation path. Adaptation transfers will fully crowd out domestic adaptation in a first best setting. Transfers will decrease overall mitigation in our numerical simulations.

40|$|In {{this article}} is {{revealed}} how the Belgian inheritance tax system {{was used as a}} functional political instrument, throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century. It was a tool, offering a broad range of unifying and disintegrating processes, which shaped a state identity. The emphasis lays on the many changes of the political power. This of course marked deeply the formation of the death duty legislation. Time after time, different political elites and majorities voted for changes in the existing system, using both continuous and discontinuous argumentations (the article mainly focuses on the parlementary motivations). The policy making was limited by the state itself, and by the ruling political elite (hence the use of the concept ‘state capacity’). The state merged technicity and prestige and employed the inheritance taxes to cling the local dignitaries and the local level to the administration. The Belgian tax culture – only examined in restricted sense, proceeding from the state’s and tax administration’s view – definitely was a manifestation of state identity. The Belgian tax morale – a concept comprehending fraud and anti-fiscality or the friction between the tax-paying citizen and the fiscal administration – was being modelled as well by the state and the fiscal administration, through the conscious and <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> it made...|$|R
40|$|The {{innovation}} {{process can}} be divided into three phases: fuzzy front-end (FFE) or frontend of innovation, new product development (NPD) and commercialization (Koen et al., 2002). During the front-end the product is being defined and the boundaries of the development project are set. Whereas a product innovating company needs to be proficient in all phases of innovation, the front-end has a great importance on the overall innovation performance (Khurana & Rosenthal, 1998). Current models that help to structure this phase follow a linear approach. The author argues that these do not capture real-world practices well and to increase research and development productivity, an alternative solution is needed. Therefore a design science research methodology is applied to design an innovation support framework based on the Cyclic Innovation Model (Berkhout et al., 2006) in this paper. Moreover, a research gap is addressed by combining Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions with an innovation model. The operationalized innovation support framework helps practitioners in the activity of maturing an idea to a compelling business proposition. It helps turning <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> about the product concept into explicit choices. Finally, it helps to derive recommendations for complex innovation projects with various product/market combinations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} {{the necessity of}} new criteria for evaluation of performance of unit root tests. We suggest focusing directly on the reasons that create ambiguity in unit root test’s results. Two reasons for unsatisfactory properties of unit root tests {{can be found in}} the literature (i) the model misspecification and (ii) observational equivalence. Regarding first reason, there is immense literature on several components of model specification covering specification techniques, consequence of misspecification and robust methods. However complete model specification involves multiple decisions and most of studies on performance of unit root tests do not address issue of multiple specification decisions simultaneously. The Monte Carlo studies are conditional on some of implicit specification and for Monte Carlo; these specifications are by construction valid. But for real data, the <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> are often not true and specification decisions need to be endogenized. A closer match with real case is possible if multiple specification decisions are endogenized, thus providing more reliable measure of performance of unit root tests. Second problem in differentiating trend and difference stationary process is the observational equivalence between two processes. We suggest exploring data generating processes with different long run dynamics and small sample equivalence so that a researcher should have an idea about other plausible models for a data set for which he has estimated some model. ...|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic {{forecasting}} {{is becoming}} increasingly popular in hydrology. Equally important are methods to evaluate such forecasts. There is still debate about which scores to use for this evaluation. In this paper we distinguish two scales for evaluation: information-uncertainty and utility-risk. We claim that the information-uncertainty scale is the most natural for forecast evaluation. We propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence as the appropriate measure for forecast quality and show that some commonly used scores are approximations of it. From a new decomposition of our information-theoretical score into uncertainty, correct information and wrong information, it follows directly that deterministic forecasts increase uncertainty to infinity, although they can still have value. Because information is uniquely defined, any measure that does not measure information, {{can be interpreted as}} some other form of utility. We claim that for calibration of models representing a hydrological system, information should be the objective, because it allows to learn more from the observations. Any other utility measure trains an <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> model, which inevitably results in a loss of information in the data and more risk of overfitting...|$|E
40|$|When {{a reader}} {{encounters}} a noun, she tends to rapidly associate the noun with a mental referent (representation of entity in question). Our computational model confirms that a memory-based account {{is sufficient to}} account for {{a high rate of}} success at preliminary referent retrieval. Definite noun phrases ("The dog") can be used anaphorically to refer to referents already mentioned in the text, but they also frequently introduce a new referent into the mix (Poesio & Vieira, 1998). An adequate model must account for how a reader makes an explicit or <b>implicit</b> <b>decision</b> about each noun's anaphoric status. We suggest that LTM contains both generic referent types and specific referent tokens, which simultaneously compete for retrieval via resonance. Our ACT-R simulation operationalizes the memory-based view to model the pre and post-noun activations of referents in memory. It predicts which referent will be retrieved (i. e. the most active), and consequently whether an anaphor will be initially treated as a new referent. The influence of anaphor word choice is explained, and encompasses metaphoric anaphors. Simulations results are congruent with human performance in our eye-tracked reading study, in which regressions to reanalyze an anaphor are indicative of the incidence of preliminary error...|$|E

40|$|When {{developing}} computational {{models to}} analyze the tradeoffs between climate risk management strategies (i. e., mitigation, adaptation, or geoengineering), scientists make explicit and <b>implicit</b> <b>decisions</b> that are influenced by their beliefs, values and preferences. Model descriptions typically include only the explicit decisions and are silent on value judgments that may explain these decisions. Eliciting scientists’ mental models, a systematic approach to determining how they think about climate risk management, can help to gain {{a clearer understanding of}} their modeling decisions. In order to identify and represent the role of values, beliefs and preferences on decisions, we used an augmented mental models research approach, namely values-informed mental models (ViMM). We conducted and qualitatively analyzed interviews with eleven climate risk management scientists. Our results suggest that these scientists use a similar decision framework to each other to think about modeling climate risk management tradeoffs, including eight specific decisions ranging from defining the model objectives to evaluating the model’s results. The influence of values on these decisions varied between our scientists and between the specific decisions. For instance, scientists invoked ethical values (e. g., concerns about human welfare) when defining objectives, but epistemic values (e. g., concerns about model consistency) were more influential when evaluating model results. ViMM can (i) enable insights that can inform the design of new computational models and (ii) make value judgments explicit and more inclusive of relevant values. This transparency can help model users to better discern the relevance of model results to their own decision framing and concerns...|$|R
