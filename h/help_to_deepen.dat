60|$|But see! Roger Conant {{has other}} neighbors within view. Peter Palfrey {{likewise}} has built himself a house, {{and so has}} Balch, and Norman, and Woodbury. Their dwellings, indeed,--such is the ingenious contrivance of this piece of pictorial mechanism,--seem to have arisen, at various points of the scene, even while we {{have been looking at}} it. The forest-track, trodden more and more by the hobnailed shoes of these sturdy and ponderous Englishmen, has now a distinctness which it never could have acquired from the light tread of a hundred times as many Indian moccasins. It will be a street, anon! As we observe it now, it goes onward from one clearing to another, here plunging into a shadowy strip of woods, there open to the sunshine, but everywhere showing a decided line, along which human interests have begun to hold their career. Over yonder swampy spot, two trees have been felled, and laid side by side to make a causeway. In another place, the axe has cleared away a confused intricacy of fallen trees and clustered boughs, which had been tossed together by a hurricane. So now the little children, just beginning to run alone, may trip along the path, and not often stumble over an impediment, unless they stray from it to gather wood-berries beneath the trees. And, besides the feet of grown people and children, there are the cloven hoofs of a small herd of cows, who seek their subsistence from the native grasses, and <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>deepen</b> the track of the future thoroughfare. Goats also browse along it, and nibble at the twigs that thrust themselves across the way. Not seldom, in its more secluded portions, where the black shadow of the forest strives to hide the trace of human-footsteps, stalks a gaunt wolf, on the watch for a kid or a young calf; or fixes his hungry gaze on the group of children gathering berries, and can hardly forbear to rush upon them. And the Indians, coming from their distant wigwams to view the white man's settlement, marvel at the deep track which he makes, and perhaps are saddened by a flitting presentiment that this heavy tread will find its way over all the land; and that the wild-woods, the wild wolf, and the wild Indian will alike be trampled beneath it. Even so shall it be. The pavements of the Main Street must be laid over the red man's grave.|$|E

5000|$|To {{address this}} {{ambiguity}} in the theory, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) [...] conducted an extensive empirical work for 20 countries over a 25-year sample {{and found that}} banking-sector problems not only are generally followed by a currency crisis, but also help to predict them. A currency crisis, on the other hand, does not help to predict {{the beginning of a}} banking crisis, but does help to predict the peak of a banking crisis. That is, although it doesn't cause the beginning of a banking crisis, a Balance-of-Payment crisis may <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>deepen</b> an existing banking crisis, creating thus a [...] "vicious cycle". This result is supported by Goldstein (2005), who found that with the existence of strategic complementarities between speculators and creditors in the model, an increase in the probability of one type of crisis generates an increase in the probability of the other type. This [...] "vicious cycle" [...] would be responsible for the severity of twin crises if compared to single crises, resulting in much higher fiscal costs [...] for the affected economy.|$|E

Although Nigeria is rich in natural resources such as oil and Gas and minerals, poor infrastructure, corruption and absence of robust financial and derivatives market has not helped in transforming the abundant resources to real economic gains and transformation.
