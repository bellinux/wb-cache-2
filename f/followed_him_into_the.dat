25|$|Al Harrington, a {{small forward}} who had {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} best sixth-men in the NBA, was dealt in the offseason to the Atlanta Hawks in return for Stephen Jackson after Harrington allegedly demanded that the Pacers start him or trade him. Nevertheless, the Pacers started off the 2004–05 season in extremely strong fashion–until the infamous events of November 19, 2004. Toward the end of a Pacers victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004, the Pacers' Ron Artest committed a hard foul against Ben Wallace. Wallace retaliated with a hard push, and the situation escalated to a full-scale brawl, with fans and several Pacers taking part. While Artest defiantly laid atop the scorer's table, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, causing him to charge into the stands. Stephen Jackson <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stands while Jermaine O'Neal struck a fan who came onto the court. The game was called off with 46 seconds left on the clock and the Pacers left the floor amid a shower of beer and other beverages that rained down from the stands.|$|E

The marquis had warned the Progressive cabinet that Brazil was unprepared to intervene in Uruguay and even less prepared to resist a foreign invasion. His warnings were ignored, and he complained, with a bit of irony, to his friend João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe, a former colleague in the Conciliation cabinet: [...] "I am almost mad with the mistakes that I am seeing being made, but since I am a red [...] I am not listened to, since everything is progress in our country." ...|$|E
500|$|Acland's {{eldest son}} died an infant {{and so his}} second son, Thomas Dyke Acland (1752–1794), became the ninth Baronet. Like his father, he was known locally in Devon and Somerset as [...] "Sir Thomas his Honour" [...] and they shared a passion for staghunting. He <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mastership of the North Devon Staghounds and {{virtually}} abandoned the family's main seat of Killerton in mid-Devon to live at Holnicote and Highercombe, near Dulverton, on {{the north and south}} edges respectively of the ancient royal forest of Exmoor, renown for its herds of red deer.

He was a stern employer of his hunt-staff, and on one occasion when his hounds had killed several sheep, possibly belonging to his farming tenants, he ordered his huntsman [...] "to hang himself and the whole pack".|$|E
