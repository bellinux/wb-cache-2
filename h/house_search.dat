6000|$|The sentries on {{the wall}} were doubled, and then a house to <b>house</b> <b>search</b> was commenced, every {{possible}} place of concealment being rummaged from basement to attic. Presently the searchers entered the lane in which Mrs. Martin lived. The latch was ere long lifted, and a sergeant and six soldiers burst into the room. The sight which they beheld quieted their first noisy exclamations. Four women in deep mourning were kneeling by a rough coffin placed on trestles. One of them gave a faint scream as they entered, and Mary Martin, rising to her feet, said: ...|$|E

60|$|As Saxon's {{strength}} {{came back}} to her (and when Doctor Hentley had privily assured Billy that she was sound as a dollar), she herself took up the matter of the industrial tragedy that had taken place before her door. The militia had been called out immediately, Billy informed her, and was encamped then at the foot of Pine street on the waste ground next to the railroad yards. As for the strikers, fifteen of them were in jail. A house to <b>house</b> <b>search</b> had been made in the neighborhood by the police, and in this way nearly the whole fifteen, all wounded, had been captured. It would go hard with them, Billy foreboded gloomily. The newspapers were demanding blood for blood, and all the ministers in Oakland had preached fierce sermons against the strikers. The railroad had filled every place, and it was well known that the striking shopmen not only would never get their old jobs back but were blacklisted in every railroad in the United States. Already they were beginning to scatter. A number had gone to Panama, and four were talking of going to Ecuador to work in the shops of the railroad that ran over the Andes to Quito.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Intraurban {{migration}} defines many neighbourhood {{dynamics and}} consequently impacts land use {{patterns in the}} long term. Housing location decision-making is a complex process involving many features of the housing market that interact with the perceptions of home searchers. Although modellers have {{paid much attention to}} the prices and utilities of the environmental, ecological, and public services associated with <b>housing,</b> the <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> process is neglected in many agent-based land use models involving urban housing market. The challenge of incorporating <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> partially lies in the prohibitive cost of identifying, recording, and quantifying <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> activities at a large scale. This paper presents an agent-based model of intraurban migration featuring straightforward yet empirically accurate rules for <b>housing</b> <b>search.</b> Drawing on intervening opportunity and intraurban migration theories, this model is specified and calibrated using real-world housing vacancies and relocation origin-destination pairs extracted from parcel records available in the Twin Cities for 2005 to 2007. Multiple validation methods, including inner migration rates, Syrjala tests, and minimum spanning tree comparisons, show that the search rules based on housing vacancy distribution and negative exponential distance-decay probability can satisfactorily simulate the pattern of the <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> and locational choices made by homeowners in the Twin Cities of Minnesota...|$|R

It is a technique used where there is no hard intelligence of weapons in the house and therefore is less intense than a normal <b>house</b> <b>search.</b> It is used in urban neighborhoods.

40|$|The {{importance}} of search behaviour {{has long been}} recognised {{in the study of}} housing markets, but research in this area has frequently been hampered by lack of data. In many nations, the vast majority of initial <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> queries are now conducted online and the data this generates could, in theory, provide us with better insights into how <b>housing</b> market <b>search</b> operates spatially, in addition to generating new knowledge on the geography of local housing submarkets. This paper seeks to explore these propositions by discussing existing conceptions of search before developing a framework for understanding <b>housing</b> <b>search</b> in the digital age. A large, user-generated <b>housing</b> market <b>search</b> data-set is then introduced and analysed with respect to area definition, submarket geography and search pressure locations. The results indicate that this kind of ‘big data’ approach to housing research could generate important new insights for housing market analysts...|$|R
