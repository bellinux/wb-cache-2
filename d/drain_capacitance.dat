40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} fast and {{efficient}} techniques {{to analyze the}} power grid with accurate modeling of the transistor network. The solution techniques currently available for power grid analysis rely on a model of representing the transistor network as a current source. The disadvantage of the above model is that the <b>drain</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the PMOS transistors which are already on is not modeled. The <b>drain</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the PMOS transistors which are on, actmuch like a decoupling capacitance in the power grid. By ignoring the <b>drain</b> <b>capacitance,</b> the voltage drop predicted is pessimistic. This implies that a designer is likely to overestimate the amount of decoupling capacitance needed. In our proposed model, we model the transistor network as a simple switch in series with a RC circuit. The presence of switches leads to a non-constant conductance matrix. So, the switch is modeled behaviorally to make the conductance matrix a constant in presence of switches. The resulting conductance matrix is a M-matrix thus making it amenable to linear algebraic methods presented in the literature. The proposed model is nearly as accurate as the SPICE model in predicting the voltage drop. We demonstrate that the current source model of the transistor network has an error of about 10 % in predicting the voltage drop. The proposed model offers the middle ground between the accuracy of SPICE simulation and {{the speed of the}} current source model. The proposed model is 20 − 30 × faster than SPICE. It also reduces the size of the decoupling capacitance by 2 − 10 × in comparison with the methods presented in the literature...|$|E

40|$|This unique push-pull/parallel circuit {{produces}} a power output of four devices without the added loss {{and cost of}} power splitters and combiners. Motorola MRF 150 RF power FET {{makes it possible to}} parallel two or more devices at relatively high power levels. This technique is considered impractical for bipolar transistors due to their low input impedance. In a common-source amplifier configuration, a power FET has approximately five to ten times higher input impedance than a comparable bipolar transistor in a common emitter circuit. The output impedance in both cases is determined by the dc supply voltage and power level. The limit to the number of FETs that can be paralleled is dictated by physical, rather than electrical restrictions, where the mutual inductance between the drains is the most critical aspect, limiting the upper frequency range of operation. The magnitude of these losses is relative to the impedance levels involved, and becomes more serious at lower supply voltages and higher power levels. Since the minimum mounting distance of the transistors is limited by the package size, the only real improvement would be a multiple die package. For higher frequency circuits, these mutual inductances {{could be used as a}} part of the matching network, but it would seriously limit the bandwidth of the amplifier. This technique is popular with many VHF bipolar designs. In paralleling power FETs another important aspect must be considered: If the unity gain frequency (fα) of the device is sufficiently high, an oscillator will be created, where the paralleling inductances together with the gate and <b>drain</b> <b>capacitances</b> will form resonant circuits. The feedback is obtained through the <b>drain</b> to gate <b>capacitance</b> (Crss), which will result in 360 ° phase shift usually somewhere higher than the amplifier bandwidth. Thus, the oscillations may not be directly noticed in the amplifier output, but may have high amplitudes at the drains. This can be cured by isolating the paralleling inductance, which consists of the dc blocking capacitors (C 7 – C 10, Figure 2) and their wiring inductance from the gates. Low value noninductive resistors which do not appreciably affect the system gain can be used for this purpose...|$|R
