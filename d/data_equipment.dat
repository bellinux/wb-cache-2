50|$|In telecommunications, RS-232 is a {{standard}} for serial communication transmission of data.

The RS-232 standard is commonly used in computer serial ports. The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors.

50|$|These {{alarm states}} are also lumped under the term Carrier Group Alarm (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the digital carrier has failed. The {{result of the}} CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state {{that will result in}} the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the customer equipment connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. <b>Data</b> <b>equipment</b> usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{understanding}} health risks related to exposures requires the collection of [...] "basic characterization" [...] information from available sources. A traditional method applied by occupational hygienists to initially survey a workplace or environment is used to determine both the types and possible exposures from hazards (e.g. noise, chemicals, radiation). The walk-through survey can be targeted or limited to particular hazards such as silica dust, or noise, {{to focus attention on}} control of all hazards to workers. A full walk-through survey is frequently used to provide information on establishing a framework for future investigations, prioritizing hazards, determining the requirements for measurement and establishing some immediate control of potential exposures. The Health Hazard Evaluation Program from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is an example of an industrial hygiene walk-through survey. Other sources of basic characterization information include worker interviews, observing exposure tasks, material safety data sheets, workforce scheduling, production <b>data,</b> <b>equipment</b> and maintenance schedules to identify potential exposure agents and people possibly exposed.|$|E
