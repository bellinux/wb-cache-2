5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went to <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, {{she returned to}} campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report {{but there is no}} documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{programming}} {{such as a}} Sophomore Social, recruiting events, and a Research Interest Group {{serve to}} strengthen a sense of community. Events put on by the Honors Business Association (HBA) such as <b>Dinners</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Professor (DWAPs), <b>Dinners</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Alumni (DWAAs), and service opportunities, give students incentive to interact with their cohort and upperclassmen.

The choir sings Evensong every Sunday, and also sings for various special services and events, including two carol services, the annual joint service with Lincoln College and other occasions. Recently there has been the inauguration of a biennial Alumni and Music Reunion <b>Dinner,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Festal Evensong for all attendees preceding this. The choir regularly goes on tour, for instance to Paris in 2006, Lombardy in 2009, Rome in 2010 and Belgium in 2013, and sings at cathedrals near Oxford during term-time.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, Dussek and {{his wife}} began having serious marital troubles. In an account of {{uncertain}} veracity, {{it was reported that}} Sophia, who {{had fallen in love with}} another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Baillie {{happened}} to have <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend of Thomas Erskine, a newly qualified barrister and former seaman with the Royal Navy. Erskine himself also attended the dinner, although Baillie and Erskine were then unacquainted. When Erskine, unaware of Baillie's presence, [...] "launched into an eloquent tirade against the corrupt and tyrannical practises of Sandwich", Baillie resolved to have him as counsel in the case. The next morning, Erskine received the brief for R v Baillie and a retainer of one guinea. Initially thinking {{he was the only}} barrister Baillie had retained, he was disappointed to find out that he was but one of five, the other four being Edward Bearcroft, Harry Peckham, Murphy and Hargrave, and that he was scheduled to speak last.|$|E

Homer is chosen, much to Marge's chagrin.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions. Showing the typical rebelliousness of his early years, Niven asked, [...] "Could you tell me the time, sir? I have to catch a train." ...|$|E

2500|$|From the patrons' {{point of}} view, AYCE seats {{are viewed as}} a bargain {{considering}} the added cost of ballpark food. After a few orders of hot dogs, nachos, and soft drinks, the AYCE seat pays for itself. The Atlanta Braves estimated that a typical AYCE patron in 2007 consumed 3.35 hot dogs, 20 ounces of soda, 7.9 ounces of peanuts; 3 ounces of nachos; and 32 ounces of popcorn. AYCE seats {{have been described as}} a way to indulge in junk food [...] "with baseball as a nominal backdrop", an opportunity to eat a cheap <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> baseball game thrown in, and a way to feed a family on a budget. AYCE patrons have been known to engage in eating contests and to sneak food home with them.|$|E
