5|$|Barrett {{presented}} Xem as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as {{a natural}} and necessary further development of Aquino's Xeper. Aquino later acknowledged Xem as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its exclusivity as <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{reserved}} {{the right}} not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Sold {{exclusively}} in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs a regional lockout. Sega's {{focus on the}} Sega Saturn left the Nomad undersupported, and the handheld itself was <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> several Genesis peripherals, including the Power Base Converter, the Sega CD, and the 32X.|$|E
5|$|Some older 48K and 128K {{games were}} <b>{{incompatible}}</b> <b>with</b> the machine. The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible due {{to differences in}} ROM and expansion connector, making it impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units.|$|E
5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} is <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> {{the first and}} second boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> dying a heroic death during the war and both are <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being {{in prison for}} committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center {{was the target}} of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the project in the first place. Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|As {{a widely}} used {{international}} standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards {{and used by}} international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information.

5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> a proposed northern location.|$|E
5000|$|One {{objection}} is that extant {{models of}} digital physics are <b>incompatible</b> [...] <b>with</b> {{the existence of}} several continuous characters of physical symmetries, e.g., rotational symmetry, translational symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, and the Lie group gauge invariance of Yang-Mills theories, all central to current physical theory.|$|R

5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E

In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> his status as a British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International organises {{campaigns to}} protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a {{prisoner}} of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was {{the winner of the}} 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E
40|$| 0;kDa), in the <b>incompatible</b> interaction; <b>with</b> a weak {{activity}} of only PgMPK 1 in the compatible interaction. Immunoblot analysis showed PgMPK 1 and PgMPK 2 to be orthologs of salicylic acid-induced protein kinase and wound-induced protein kinase, respectively. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed pathogen-induced accumulation and nuclear localisation of PgMPKs {{only in the}} <b>incompatible</b> interaction <b>with</b> highest signals in the vascular tissues. Maximum PgMPKs activation correlated with the activation of several defence-related enzymes. In addition, inhibition of MAPK-activation by kinase cascade inhibitors correlated with the suppression of defence-related enzyme activities and pathogen-induced {H 2 O 2 } accumulation. Treatment of pearl millet seedlings with abiotic and biotic elicitors led to a strong early induction of only PgMPK 1. β-Amino butyric acid and {H 2 O 2 } {{were found to be}} best activators of PgMPK 1. These results suggest that in pearl millet {MAPK} signalling is involved in mediating several defence mechanisms in response to pathogen infection...|$|R
