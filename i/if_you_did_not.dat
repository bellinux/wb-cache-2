[...] The letter was released to the media, and Wappel's remarks were widely criticized by journalists and MPs from all parties.

2500|$|Kohl {{knew that}} all these people were {{the basis of his}} {{political}} power and that he needed their loyalty and personal affection. He could also be rude to subordinates and assistants, and confront political adversaries. [...] "He was capable of both - being empathetic and being extremely confrontational! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> do what he wanted, empathy was over!", as Gast quotes a federal minister of Kohl's own party. There was also a difference between the younger Kohl and the chancellor in his later years, a parliamentary state secretary recalled: [...] "A sense of tact and politeness? The early and the later Kohl - that was a tremendous difference. In the early years he had all of that, in the later years no more." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and least {{complicated}} DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo NES games was when the game would pause and ask you to look up a certain page in the booklet that came with the game, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the book or entered the key wrong you could not continue. A product key, a typically alphanumerical serial number used to represent a license to a particular piece of software. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online [...] "activation"), as the software could be cracked to run without a product key, or [...] "keygen" [...] programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.|$|E
