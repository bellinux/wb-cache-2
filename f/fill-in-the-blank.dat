5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For <b>Fill-in-the-Blank,</b> the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E
25|$|Match Game is an American {{television}} panel game show that premiered on NBC in 1962 and was revived {{several times over}} the course of the next few decades.

25|$|For {{this edition}} of Match Game, two contestants competed, with one usually a {{returning}} champion. Instead of attempting to match {{as many of the}} six panelists as possible over the course of two rounds, the two contestants won money by making matches, with the high scorer becoming champion {{at the end of the}} game. As in the 1970s series, two rounds of <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> questions were played, with each match paying off at $50.|$|E
25|$|If {{the game}} {{ended in a}} tie, one last <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> phrase was shown to both contestants along with three choices. The {{champion}} chose an answer first and the challenger chose one of the remaining two answers. After the choices were made, the last celebrity who played the second Match-Up round was told which answers the contestants selected and was then asked to choose one of them. The contestant whose chosen answer matched the answer said by that celebrity won an additional $100 and the game.|$|E

2500|$|A {{contestant}} who won {{money in}} the Audience Match then {{had the opportunity to}} win ten times that amount (therefore, $5,000, $2,500, or $1,000) by exactly matching another <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> response with one celebrity panelist. Originally, the contestant chose the celebrity; later, the celebrity who played this match was determined by the Star Wheel. In the very start of the 1970s series, Rayburn read the question before the celebrity was chosen, but this was changed after the first two shows. The format of these matches was much shorter and non-humorous, typically requiring the contestant and celebrity to choose from a number of similar familiar phrases, for example, [...] "Baseball _____" [...] (baseball game, baseball diamond, etc.). The contestant was instructed that their response must be an exact match, although singular/plural matches were usually accepted, whereas synonyms were not.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> item {{provides}} a test taker with identifying characteristics and requires the test taker {{to recall the}} correct term. [...] There {{are two types of}} <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> tests. The easier version {{provides a}} word bank of possible words that will fill in the blanks. For some exams all words in the word bank are used exactly once. If a teacher wanted to create a test of medium difficulty, they would provide a test with a word bank, but some words may be used more than once and others not at all. The hardest variety of such a test is a <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> test in which no word bank is provided at all. This generally requires a higher level of understanding and memory than a multiple choice test. Because of this, <b>fill-in-the-blank</b> testsno word bank are often feared by students.|$|E

We investigated how much participants read parts of educational text when {{they are required to}} answer questions relating to it. We found that there is no difference between the normalized number of fixations observed when participants answered multiple-choice questions correctly compared to when they answered incorrectly, however, there are differences for <b>fill-in-the-blanks</b> questions. Different presentation formats of the text and questions {{have an effect on the}} how thoroughly paragraphs containing answers to questions are read. For formats where only text is presented the first or last paragraphs are read the most thoroughly. For formats where the questions are shown with text, the <b>fill-in-the-blanks</b> questions were read more thoroughly than other parts on the page. This can be used to influence how students learn material in eLearning environments...|$|R

40|$|This study mainly investigates L 1 -Turkish speakers’ article {{choice in}} L 2 -English. In the study participants’ answers were {{analyzed}} {{on the basis}} of the following semantic features: definiteness, specificity and partitivity. This study also examines whether the article choice of the participants varies according to their proficiency levels in L 2 -English. The data collection instrument adopted in this study was a <b>fill-in-the-blanks</b> test which included six types of sentences. The test was administered to 30 low-proficiency and 30 high-proficiency level participants. The results of the <b>fill-in-the-blanks</b> test showed that accuracy rates in six types of sentences were higher than the overuses. In other words, the participants of the study did not associate article the with [+specific] contexts and a with [-specific] contexts. It was also found that the overuse of article the did not reach its maximum level in [+partitive, +specific] contexts. Considering that this study also investigates the article choice of the participants of different proficiency levels, it is clear that the results of the current study are in the line with the previous literature which evidences the role of proficiency in the article choice in L 2 -English...|$|R
