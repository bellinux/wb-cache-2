500|$|The {{beheading}} game {{appears in}} a number of tales, the earliest being the Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. The challenger in this story is named [...] "Fear", a bachlach (churl), and is identified as Cú Roí (a superhuman king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology) in disguise. He challenges three warriors to his game, only to have them run from the return blow, until the hero Cú Chulainn accepts the challenge. With Cú Chulainn under his axe, this antagonist also feints three blows before letting the hero go. In the Irish version, the cloak of the churl is described as grey (glas), which may also mean green. In the Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, another similar challenge is issued. In this story, a notable difference is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. The French romances La Mule sans <b>Frein</b> and Hunbaut and the Middle High German epic poem Diu Crone feature Gawain in beheading game situations. Hunbaut furnishes an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man's head, and then pulls off his magic cloak before he can replace it, causing his death. A similar story, this time attributed to Lancelot, appears in the 13th century French work Perlesvaus.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} several lesser works, {{not all of}} which can be {{securely}} ascribed to Chrétien. Philomela {{is the only one of}} his four poems based on Ovid's Metamorphoses that has survived. [...] Two short-lyric chansons on the subject of love are also very likely his, but the attribution of the pious romance Guillaume d'Angleterre to him is now widely doubted. It has also been suggested that Chrétien might be the author of two short verse romances called Le Chevalier á l'épée and La Mule sans <b>frein,</b> but this theory has not found much support. Chrétien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to Cligès, where he also mentions his work about King Mark and Iseult. The latter is presumably related to the Tristan and Iseult legend, though Tristan is not named. [...] Chrétien's Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Cligès, Chrétien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive. Chrétien's works are written in vernacular Old French, although it is marked by traits of the regional Champenois dialect (which is still fairly similar to the [...] "standard" [...] French of Paris).|$|E

Since Bell Labs did not make a public announcement of the transistor until June 1948, the transistron was considered to be independently developed. Mataré had first observed transconductance effects during the manufacture of silicon diodes for German radar equipment during WWII. Transistrons were commercially manufactured for the French telephone company and military, and in 1953 a solid-state radio receiver with four transistrons was demonstrated at the Düsseldorf Radio Fair.|$|R

5000|$|MAFAC, or Manufacture Arvernoise de <b>Freins</b> et Accessoires pour Cycles (Arveni Manufacturing Works for Bicycle Brakes and Accessories), was a French {{manufacturer}} of bicycle brakes and tool kits.

Later MAFAC brakes were of a center-pull design in which a straddle cable links the two overlapping arms of the brake. Like the cantilever design, it is actuated by pulling from the center of this cable. MAFAC's rubber brake hoods, originating in the late 1940s, had built-in adjusters, allowing adjustment of the brakes while riding.

40|$|Le {{processus}} de stigmatisation est un des principaux <b>freins</b> à l’emploi des personnes présentant des troubles psychiques. Sonder les représentations de l’employeur est un premier indicateur de la compréhension générale des processus psychologiques qui le guident dans le recrutement de ce type de public. La présente étude vise à identifier les représentations d’employeurs vis-à-vis du « trouble psychique » en général et au travail, et des prérequis pour l’embauche afin de comprendre les processus psychologiques qui conduisent à l’exclusion professionnelle des personnes en situation de handicap psychique. Vingt-neuf entretiens semi-directifs ont été menés auprès d’employeurs d’organisations implantées sur le territoire français et soumises à l’obligation d’emploi de travailleurs handicapés (OETH). Les résultats montrent des représentations du trouble psychique très péjoratives axées sur la déviance sociale (non-conformité à la norme sociale) et le préjudice que ces personnes constitueraient pour la société tout entière à cause des perturbations de l’interaction sociale et du fardeau qu’induirait le trouble psychique pour l’entourage et particulièrement pour le milieu de travail. L’analyse des prérequis pour l’embauche de personnes en situation de handicap psychique montre à quel point ces représentations sont des <b>freins</b> au recrutement principalement liés à un manque d’adéquation perçue à l’emploi. Des perspectives de recherche et d’actions visant l’apprentissage et le perfectionnement des pratiques de recrutement et d’intégration en milieu de travail sont proposées pour accompagner les acteurs des organisations dans ce type d’inclusion. Introduction People {{with mental}} disorders face stigma and discriminatory hiring {{practices in the}} competitive labour market. This study on employers’ representations of mental disorders provides knowledge regarding the specifics of their negative perceptions for this population, {{which appears to be}} an important barrier to their inclusion in the workplace. Heilman’s lack of fit model (1983) enabled to show that recruiters seek to match the characteristics they perceive in candidates with those they deem necessary to succeed in the organization. A lack of fit between the two components—candidates and the selection criteria—would explain the non-selection of the applicant. This psychological process {{can be applied to the}} recruitment of people with psychiatric disabilities. Objectives The goal of this study was to identify employers’ representations towards mental disorder in general and in the workplace particularly, as well as to determine the prerequisites for hiring this population. As such, this would allow to better understand the psychological processes involved in the exclusion of people with psychiatric disabilities. Method In a qualitative study, 29 semi-structured interviews were conducted with employers and HR Department representatives of organizations in France that were under the French legal obligation to hire people with a disability (organizations having more than 20 employees). We used the free association technique to identify representational contents concerning mental disorder. Qualitative data on the essential prerequisites for recruitment were collected through open-ended questions. The data were processed by a categorical content analysis conducted independently by three researchers. The structure of the representation was identified by distinguishing the components of the central nucleus from those of the peripheral nucleus according to the two criteria of the method of Moliner (1994) : the index of popularity of each element and the co-occurrence between each element of the representation. Results Results revealed negative representations of people with mental disorders, focusing on social deviance and harm to society, believing that people with mental disorders would have non-standard skills and behaviours and would be socially disruptive and burdensome, particularly in the workplace. The analysis of the prerequisites for hiring persons with psychiatric disabilities showed how these representations towards mental disorders are barriers for their recruitment, mainly linked to a perceived lack of employment fit. Conclusion Future avenues of research and actions are suggested. They are as follows: learning, education on mental disorders, training and specific techniques to reduce organizational stakeholders’ stereotypes and prejudice. Also, supporting stakeholders for the inclusion of people with mental disorders in the workplace appears fundamental, especially by improving recruitment and integration practises...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCet article interroge les {{relations}} entre l'inscription au patrimoine mondial de l'Humanité et les dynamiques touristiques, sous l'angle des <b>freins</b> dans {{la mise en place}} de synergies entre les registres patrimoniaux et touristiques. L'exemple du massif de l'uKhahlamba-Drakensberg (Afrique du Sud), inscrit depuis 2000 au titre des biens mixtes, permet d'observer des décalages entre les effets initialement souhaités par les acteurs en matière de développement touristique avec l'inscription au patrimoine mondial et la réalité des dynamiques touristiques engendrées. Ce hiatus invite à rechercher les facteurs explicatifs de telles distorsions. A partir des pièces constitutives du dossier UNESCO de 2000, des plans de gestion des acteurs {{en charge}} du massif et de plusieurs campagnes de terrain (entre octobre 2009 et octobre 2011), l'article vient souligner le rôle joué par des effets de sites, mais plus encore par les jeux d'acteurs et les modes d'association des populations locales. [...] - We consider the changing tourism and management dynamics that occur when a site is {{inscribed on the}} UNESCO World Heritage List. We use the example of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg World Heritage Site (South Africa), a mixed natural and cultural property listed predominantly because of its beautiful southern alpine mountain scenery and its spectacular rock art. It was listed in 2000. This case study allows us to explore the gap between the tourism boom anticipated prior to nomination and actual post-inscription visitor numbers and management realities. Drawing upon the UNESCO nomination file, management plans and several field trips (between October, 2009 and October, 2011), we start with an analysis of the UNESCO inscription process and the expectations at the time of nomination. We then consider the evolution of the post-inscription tourist dynamics and discuss the reasons behind the low visitor numbers realised at rock art sites and the implications of this. Our comparative approach focuses upon the major rock art tourism sites and highlights the key importance of local tourism infrastructure and accessibility in determining visitor numbers. Moreover we see the direct negative effects of stakeholder failing to cooperate and failing to realise sustainable local community involvement. Besides the broad lessons that we can learn from this example we explore the ways in which stakeholders can be confronted and called upon to deliver on their UNESCO World Heritage List nomination commitments regarding tourist development. Finally we discuss problems inherent to the category of mixed property as established by UNESCO...|$|R
