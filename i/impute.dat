5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to <b>impute</b> alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E

However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to <b>impute</b> to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective types of recommender systems. As data sparsity remains a significant challenge for CF, we consider basing predictions on <b>imputed</b> data, and find this often improves performance on very sparse rating data. In this paper, we propose two <b>imputed</b> neighborhood based collaborative filtering (INCF) algorithms: <b>imputed</b> nearest neighborhood CF (INN-CF) and <b>imputed</b> densest neighborhood CF (IDN-CF), each of which first <b>imputes</b> the user rating data using an imputation technique, before using a traditional Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm on the resulting <b>imputed</b> data of the most similar neighbors or the densest neighbors to make CF predictions for a specific user. We compared an extension of Bayesian multiple imputation (eBMI) and the mean imputation (MEI) in these INCF algorithms, with the commonly-used neighborhood based CF, Pearson correlation-based CF, as well as a densest neighborhood based CF. Our empirical results show that IDN-CF using eBMI significantly outperforms its rivals and takes less time to make its best predictions. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} use {{calibrated}} imputation {{to compensate for}} missing values. This technique consists of finding final <b>imputed</b> values that are {{as close as possible}} to preliminary <b>imputed</b> values and are calibrated to satisfy constraints. Preliminary <b>imputed</b> values, potentially justified by an imputation model, are obtained through deterministic single imputation. Using appropriate constraints, the resulting <b>imputed</b> estimator is asymptotically unbiased for estimation of linear population parameters such as domain totals. A quasi-model-assisted approach is considered in the sense that inferences do not depend on the validity of an imputation model and are made with respect to the sampling design and a non-response model. An imputation model may still be used to generate <b>imputed</b> values and thus to improve the efficiency of the <b>imputed</b> estimator. This approach has the characteristic of handling naturally the situation where more than one imputation method is used owing to missing values in the variables that are used to obtain <b>imputed</b> values. We use the Taylor linearization technique to obtain a variance estimator under a general non-response model. For the logistic non-response model, we show that ignoring the effect of estimating the non-response model parameters leads to overestimating the variance of the <b>imputed</b> estimator. In practice, the overestimation is expected to be moderate or even negligible, as shown in a simulation study. Copyright 2005 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
30|$|In general, careful {{modeling}} {{is required}} when using MICE to obtain valid statistical inferences (Marchenko, 2011). Another important point to remember concerns {{the order in}} which the imputation models should be <b>imputed.</b> Imputation using chained equations does not require us to specifically order the variables that must be <b>imputed</b> because the software <b>imputes,</b> by default, the variables from the most observed to the least observed.|$|R

Analyst Petar Klisarov has voiced his disapproval of the demonstrators (especially the emigrant students who participated in protests on 26 December 2013 and 3 January 2014) for flaunting Bulgarian legal regulations, for example by behaving disrespectfully towards police officers and blocking the city traffic on a whim, suggesting that they would have been much more disciplined and law-abiding if the activities were taking place abroad. Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova is also claimed to have been overly permissive of the demonstrators at the expense of the other members of society.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to <b>impute</b> knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E
25|$|Again {{there are}} {{technical}} {{issues relating to}} spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, {{the solution to the}} problem is to <b>impute</b> physical reality to the gauge function θ(x). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of V and A.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.|$|E

Using micro-data from the 2004 Wealth Survey produced by Statistics Finland we find that owner-occupied housing has {{a significant impact on}} the well-being of many households. In 2004 <b>imputed</b> rental income constituted on average about 10 percent of homeowner households? disposable income. Furthermore, including <b>imputed</b> rental income to household disposable income decreased overall inequality measured by the Gini index.

On the other hand, the tax subsidy resulting from non-taxation of <b>imputed</b> rental income is skewed toward high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners and also more likely to own outright. The paper also made a comparison of the current tax system where <b>imputed</b> rental income is untaxed to two alternative tenure neutral tax systems where <b>imputed</b> rental income is taxed.
