They include the Blacksmith Index, developed with Johns Hopkins University and used {{around the world to}} rate levels of health risk from pollution; and the Blacksmith database, now known as The Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP), which endeavours to identify and screen contaminated sites in low- and middle-income countries where public health is at risk. The TSIP has identified more than 3,100 polluted sites, and screened more than 1,800 sites, representing a potential health risk to more than 80 million poor people.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{today more}} and more {{complementary}} information is available in different electronic media there is an increasing demand for the integration of traditional digital library systems and multimedia systems. In this paper we present the OMNIS/ 2 system, which is an advanced meta system and enhances existing digital library systems or retrieval systems by additional storing and indexing of user-defined multimedia documents, automatic and personal linking concepts, annotations, filtering and personalization. 1 The key concept of OMNIS/ 2 {{is that all of}} the above mentioned features are accomplished without changing the underlying documents. In our architecture existing digital library systems, which are established applications, serve as a document storage layer, while OMNIS/ 2 forms the multimedia storage layer, linking layer and personalization layer. This general approach ensures the integration and transparent combination of different digital library systems. Thus with OMNIS/ 2, even mere retrieval systems- and nowadays most digital library systems are mere retrieval systems- can be enriched to interactive multimedia DL-systems and are combined into one virtual personal digital library. OMNIS/ 2 is part of the <b>Global</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Project</b> of the G 7 countries. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{connection}} between forest fires and political unrest {{has been noted}} throughout the literature (see Thomas, 2012,) and {{in a number of}} countries including; Malawi, Madagascar, Kenya and Ethiopia (Kull, 2002, Hoffmann et al., 2009, Cochrane, 2009 and Kuhlken, 1999), but never before has it been quantified. Political unrest can often manifest itself in the form of protest or armed conflict, these may involve fire setting. This investigation evaluates and visualises the correlation between these two parameters by linking the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product with World Bank political unrest indicators and the Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset (ACLED) across sub-Saharan Africa. The investigation uses spatial techniques to analyse these data; the ACLED points were buffered by 50, 75 and 100 km, these buffers were then used to extract the burned area data surrounding the points. These data were used to calculate what proportion of burnt area within that country burnt within the defined distances of a political unrest event; these outputs were then plotted against the World Bank political unrest data for the years 2002 – 2010, no data was available for 2003. This relationship was statistically tested using a Spearman’s rank correlation. Outliers were accounted for using other data sets including the <b>Global</b> Road <b>Inventory</b> <b>Project</b> (GRIP) road data, Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC 2000), and BioClim climate data. The results of this investigation show that there is a statistically significant relationship between political unrest and forest fire for all of the years being analysed (p =. 000 -. 017). This result is of great importance as currently no fire or forest risk models incorporate political unrest as a parameter. It also has implications for forest protection programmes, as if corruption and unrest are not addressed these schemes will never reach their full potential...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} {{proliferation}} risk of separated plutonium, a technical and institutional design {{of an international}} plutonium storage system (IPSS) is presented. The IPSS is evaluated from two perspectives: its ability to address the proliferation risk of excess civilian inventories, {{and its ability to}} reduce the threat from excess Russian military plutonium. A systems dynamic model of <b>global</b> plutonium <b>inventories</b> <b>projects</b> a capacity requirement for an IPSS of 450 to 600 MT. A conceptual design of a representative 100 MT storage facility was shown to meet criticality safety requirements for a range of operational and accident scenarios. From an institutional perspective, a hybrid organizational structure drawing on rganizational features of the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency is proposed as a model for system participation and governance. For political and nonproliferation reasons, a multiple-site arrangement for the IPSS is recommended. The following locations are identified as potential IPSS sites: Savannah River (U. S.), Mayak (Russia), La Hague (France), and Rokkasho (Japan). A set of rules governing material ownership and release conditions is also proposed. Intrinsic barriers to the proliferation of plutonium of the type envisioned by the "spent fuel standard" will not be achieved for many years. In the meantime, primary reliance must be placed on extrinsic barriers. (cont.) The effectiveness of an IPSS would derive mainly from the extrinsic (institutional) barriers to proliferation it would provide. An IPSS would significantly enhance the proliferation resistance of <b>global</b> plutonium <b>inventories.</b> Several hurdles to IPSS implementation are identified, and a proposal for implementing the IPSS in Russia is described. The total life-cycle cost of an IPSS is estimated at $ 9 billion (in 2000 dollars). The cost to the U. S. of addressing the excess military plutonium problem with an IPSS strategy is estimated at $ 2. 9 billion, or $ 4. 2 billion if the U. S. covers Russian costs as well. Several financing options are identified. A lifetime-levelized plutonium storage fee of ~$ 900 /kg-year would be sufficient to recover the full life-cycle cost of the IPSS. by Eugene Bae. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Background. A {{number of}} studies have shown how {{enhanced}} social capital can improve environmental outcomes through decreased transaction costs, increased knowledge and information flow, and improved monitoring and enforcement. Objectives. Social capital {{plays an important role in}} reducing adversarial perceptions of initial site assessments of toxic hotspots. It also mobilizes stakeholders to work together to come up with a holistic and comprehensive site assessment. This paper explains the role of social capital in the conduct of the Blacksmith Institute’s <b>Global</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Project</b> site assessment protocol in the Philippines. Methods. The study describes and analyzes the role of social capital in the conduct of the initial site assessment based on the actual experiences and observations of the authors and a review of discourse that took place during regular meetings of the Blacksmith Institute’s local investigative team. Results. As of June 2011, 105 polluted sites have been identified in the Philippines. Information on the location and background of these sites came from a variety of sources, including government, environmental NGOs, academic institutions, community groups and industry associations. Seventy percent of used lead-acid battery recycling sites assessed were referred by the industry. More than 40 % of artisanal and gold-mining sites were referred by regional government and local contacts. Conclusions. Social capital has played an important role in the conduct of the Blacksmith Institute’s initial site assessment protocol. Relationships and networks within the group and among different organizations build and expand the social capital of the team and facilitate the site assessment process by making it easier to coordinate with local authorities and gain better access to research, data and key persons. It also encourages local stakeholders to take ownership of assessment findings, sometimes leading to the mobilization of various community sectors in reviewing and planning interventions to address specific health and pollution issues.

By analyzing SOC and its environment at 210 sites in uncultivated land along a 3020 km latitudinal transect in East Central Asia, we examined the effect of environmental factors on the dynamics of SOC. We found that SOC changes dramatically with the difference as high as 5 times in north China and 17 times in Mongolia. Regardless, C:N remains consistent about 12. Path analysis indicated that temperature is the dominant factor in the variation of SOC with a direct effect {{much higher than the}} indirect one, the former breaks SOC down the year round while the latter results in its growth mainly via precipitation in the winter half year. Precipitation helps accumulate SOC, {{a large part of the}} effect, however, is taken via temperature. NH 4 +-N and topography also affect SOC, their roles are played primarily via climatic factors. pH correlates significantly with SOC, the effect, however, is taken only in the winter months, contributing to the decay of SOC primarily via temperature. These factors explained as much as 79 % of SOC variations, especially in the summer months, representing the major constraints on the SOC stock. Soil texture gets increasingly fine southward, it does not, however, constitute an apparent factor. Our results suggested that recent global warming should have been adversely affecting SOC stock in the mid-latitude as temperature dominates other factors as the constraint...|$|R

A <b>global</b> <b>inventory</b> of floods is an important tool for quantifying the spatial and temporal distribution of floods and for evaluating global flood prediction models. Several <b>global</b> hazard <b>inventories</b> currently exist; however, their utility for spa-tiotemporal analysis of global floods is limited.

40|$|Having {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the number of water bodies on different geographical scales is of great importance to better understand biogeochemical cycles and to tackle the social issues related to the economic and cultural use of water bodies. However, limnological research suffers from a lack of reliable inventories; the available scientific references are predominately based on water bodies of natural origin, large in size and preferentially located in previously glaciated areas. Artificial, small and randomly distributed water bodies, especially ponds, are usually not inventoried. Following Wetzel’s theory (1990), some authors included them in <b>global</b> <b>inventories</b> by using remote sensing or mathematical extrapolation, but fieldwork on the ground has been done on a very limited amount of territory. These studies have resulted in an explosive increase in the estimated number of water bodies, going from 8. 44 million lakes (Meybeck 1995) to 3. 5 billion water bodies (Downing 2010). These numbers raise several questions, especially about the methodology used for counting small-sized water bodies and the methodological treatment of spatial variables. In this study, we use inventories of water bodies for Sweden, Finland, Estonia and France to show incoherencies generated by the “global to local” approach. We demonstrate that one universal relationship does not suffice for generating the regional or <b>global</b> <b>inventories</b> of water bodies because local conditions vary greatly from one region to another and cannot be offset adequately by each other. The current paradigm for global estimates of water bodies in limnology, which is based on one representative model applied to different territories, does not produce sufficiently exact <b>global</b> <b>inventories.</b> The step-wise progression from the local to the global scale requires the development of many regional equations based on fieldwork; a specific equation that adequately reflects the actual relationship between distribution and abundance of water bodies in a given area must be produced for each geographical region...|$|R
