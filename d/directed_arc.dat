40|$|A {{constraint}} satisfaction problem (CSP) may be overconstrained and not admit a complete solution. Optimal solutions to such partial {{constraint satisfaction}} problems (PCSPs), {{in which a}} maximum number of constraints are satisfied, can be found using branch and bound variants of CSP algorithms. Earlier work has shown how information gained through local consistency checking during preprocessing {{can be used to}} enhance search through value ordering heuristics and local lower bound calculations that involve only neighboring variables. The present work describes a family of strategies based on <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> consistency testing during preprocessing. With this approach inconsistency counts associated with each value (the number of domains that offer no support for that value) are obtained that are non-redundant, since they are unidirectional. They can, therefore, be used to obtain global lower bounds that involve the entire set of variables. By computing <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> consistency in each directi [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{described}} for enhancing performance of {{branch and bound}} methods for overconstrained CSPs. These methods improve either the upper or lower bound, respectively, during search, so the two can be combined. Upper bounds are improved by using heuristic repair methods before search {{to find a good}} solution quickly, whose cost is used as the initial upper bound. The method for improving lower bounds is an extension of <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> consistency preprocessing, used in conjunction with forward checking. After computing <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> consistency counts, inferred counts are computed for all values based on minimum counts for values of adjacent variables that are later in the search order. This inference process can be iterated, so that counts are cascaded from the end {{to the beginning of the}} search order, to augment the initial counts. Improvements in time and effort are demonstrated for both techniques using random problems. Introduction Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) invol [...] ...|$|E

The main improvement consists in exploiting a non standard form of DAC, called reversible DAC where each constraint is ex-ploited in a direction which is not necessarily determined by the variable ordering and can change dynamically during the search. Other improvements include: (i) avoiding some con-straint checks when forward-checking by exploiting the con-straint checks performed during DAC preprocessing (ii) using a dynamic variable ordering during the search, (iii) maintain-ing the directed arc-consistency counts during the search as values get deleted.

In this model contexts are not differentiated as special objects, but rather that some nodes to a greater or lesser extent have roles as encoders of contextual information.

Its strengths are its simplicity, the fact that it can relate and integrate several aspects of context and its connections with formal logic. It is not claimed that this is a model of any type of context found in human activity. ...|$|R

Alternatively, we say that this algorithm has performance ratio 53. It is also known that no deterministic greedy algorithm can achieve a performance ratio better than 53. In this paper we define the class of greedy algorithms that use randomization. We study their limitations and prove that, with high probability, randomized greedy algorithms cannot achieve a performance ratio better than 32 when applied for binary trees of depth Ω(l), and 1. 293 −o(1) when applied for binary trees of constant depth. Exploiting inherent properties of randomized greedy algorithms, we obtain the first randomized algorithm for the problem that uses at most 7 l/ 5 +o(l) colors for coloring any set of paths of maximum load l on binary trees of depth O(l 1 / 3 −ε), with high probability. We also present an existential upper bound of 7 l/ 5 +o(l) that holds on any binary tree.

Flag graphs themselves {{may be considered}} as maps embedded in the same surface as the original graph. The flag graph is the underlying graph of the dual of the barycentric subdivision of the original map. Certain operations on maps can be defined by appropriate operations on flag graphs. Orientable surfaces may be given consistent orientations, and oriented maps can be described by a generating pair consisting of a permutation and an involution {{on the set of}} arcs (or darts) defining a partially <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> graph.

Using this hierarchy, circular ray shooting queries in a simple polygon can be answered in O(log super(2) n) query time and O(n log n) space. If the radius of the circle is fixed, the query time can be improved to O(log n) and the space to O(n). The decomposition is also applied to three other circular arc query problems: shortest <b>directed</b> <b>arc,</b> arc bending, and arc pushing. Using these queries, the largest empty lune determined by two query points in a simple polygon can be computed in O(log super(3) n) time, while the circular visibility region of a query point in a simple polygon can be reported in time O(m log super(3) n), where m is the output size...|$|E

We focus on news and blog pages, which are more dynamic in nature and more appropriate for recommendation. Our proposed model is called early-adopter graph. Inthis graph, nodes represent users and a <b>directed</b> <b>arc</b> between users u and v expresses the fact that u and v visit similar pages and, in particular, that user u tends to visit those pages before user v. The weight of the edge {{is the degree to}} which the temporal rule “u visits a page before v”holds.
