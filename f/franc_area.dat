25|$|The {{stability}} of the Comorian franc is founded on tight monetary and credit discipline, underpinned by two specific safeguard measures: the central bank is required to maintain 20% foreign-exchange cover of its sight liabilities, {{and the government is}} not allowed to draw more than 20% of the previous year's budget receipts from their central bank funds. The ministers of finance of the <b>franc</b> <b>area</b> (France, the CFA zone and Comoros) meet biannually. The agreement between France and the Comoros is essentially the same as the agreement France has with the CFA Zone. It is a continuation of a relationship of monetary cooperation between the two countries that has existed for more than a century.|$|E

40|$|Communication, The World Finance Conference, {{organized}} by St. John's University in New York, July 2015 International audienceIn order {{to shed light}} on the debate concerning the exiting of the <b>Franc</b> Zone <b>area,</b> we address the issue of the growth effects of currency misalignments in Sub-Saharan African countries. To this end, we first assess misalignments which we include in a growth equation while taking into account uncertainty and “jointness” between growth determinants using recent Bayesian inference techniques. More specifically, exchange rate regimes, as well as cross-sectional error dependence, will be explored. We thus demonstrate that the gain related to undervaluation is almost zero regardless of the exchange rate regime...|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} the rendezvous, Wednesday , Jean Mazzieri {{made his}} way to the Le Chalet du Mont d'Arbois hotel where he was {{supposed}} to receive a telephone call from Félix le Chat who would ask for Jacques Dupond and arrange another meeting place for the exchange. He had with him two holdalls containing a mix of bank notes and paper designed to mimic on cursory inspection the ransom of 17 million Swiss <b>francs.</b> The <b>area</b> was under surveillance by numerous plain clothes police who were ready to intervene if necessary. The kidnappers did not call however and the operation was cancelled later that evening.|$|R
5000|$|From 1379 to 1382, Philip {{helped his}} {{father-in-law}} Louis II put down revolts in Flanders, particularly in Ghent, by organising an army against Philip van Artevelde. The revolts were finally ended in 1385, {{following the death}} of Louis II, with the Peace of Tournai. As jure uxoris Count of Flanders, he would keep in mind the economic interests of the Flemish cities, which mainly made their money from weaving and spinning. He was aided in this by the expansion of the Three Members - a parliament consisting of representatives from the towns of Bruges, Ghent and Ypres - to the Four Members through the addition of the rural <b>area</b> <b>Franc</b> of Bruges ...|$|R
5000|$|Archaeological finds {{indicate}} an early prehistoric settlement, including objects made of flint {{dating from the}} earliest Stone Age. The area was inhabited from 500 BC as shown by a cemetery in the field between Genk and As. The Romans built the road from Tongeren to Venlo via Munsterbilzen and As. The current road next to the brook and the roads to Niel and Dorne follow {{the course of the}} Roman road. However, the Romans did not establish any settlements in the area as the sandy soil was not fertile enough. After the fall of Rome, the <b>Francs</b> invaded the <b>area</b> and established themselves in As. The Merovingian cemetery indicates that As was an important village from 500 - 700. The region started to be Christianised from the eighth century, and the first church was built {{on the site of the}} current Saint Aldegonde's Church. The church is first mentioned in a letter dated 1108 in which Otbert, Prince-Bishop of Luik reported to the abbey of Rolduc about [...] "income from the churches of Riemst, Genk, As and Gellik".|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, {{the cars}} drove {{from the present}} pits on Rue de Laigné {{straight}} into the city, and after a sharp right-hand corner near the river Sarthe Pontlieue bridge (a hairpin permanently removed from the circuit in 1929), before exiting the city again on the rather straight section now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Then 17.261 km long and unpaved, a bypass within the city shortened the track in 1929, but only in 1932 the city was bypassed when the section from the pits via the Dunlop Bridge and the Esses to Tertre Rouge was added. This classic configuration was 8.369 mi long and remained almost unaltered even after the 1955 tragedy. Its frighteningly narrow pit straight was narrowed off {{to make room for}} the pits and was part of the road itself, without the road becoming wider just for the pits. The pit straight was about 12 ft wide (the pit straight was widened in 1956) and the race track and pits were not separated for another 15 years. The pit area was modified at a cost of 300 million <b>francs,</b> the signalling <b>area</b> was even moved to the exit of the slow Mulsanne corner, and the track was resurfaced.|$|R
