40|$|Mesoporous anatase {{thin films}} are very {{promising}} materials {{to act as}} electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. Randomly oriented nanocrystalline TiO 2 particles are usually used to prepare photoelectrodes with a thickness of 10 - 15 µm. 		However, in solid-state DSSCs, TiO 2 films thickness is limited to few µm allowing the adsorption of only a low quantity of photoactive dye and thus leading to a poor light harvesting and low conversion efficiencies. In order to overcome this limitation, templated-assisted dip-coating techniques are used to obtain thin films with high surface area. Moreover, templating is expected to improve the pore accessibility what would promote the solid electrolyte penetration inside the porous network, making possible efficient charge transfers. In this study, films prepared from different structuring agents are {{discussed in terms of}} microstructure properties (porosity, crystallinity) and impact on the dye loading and solid electrolyte filling. As-obtained templated films have been compared to nanocrystalline films prepared by <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>or</b> screen printing as reference. Different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atmospheric poroellipsometry (AEP) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis.) have been used to describe the microstructural features of the films. Solid electrolyte infiltration has been extensively investigated by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS). Finally, templated films were evaluated as photoelectrode in solid-state DSSCs and compared to nanoparticles layers...|$|R

40|$|Mixed-conducting {{ceramics}} {{have the}} ability to conduct oxygen with perfect selectivity at elevated temperatures, making them extremely attractive as membrane materials for oxygen separation and membrane reactor applications. While the conductivity of these materials can be quite high at elevated temperatures (typically 800 - 1000 C), much higher oxygen fluxes, or, alternatively, equivalent fluxes at lower temperatures, could be provided by supported thin or thick film membrane layers. Based on that motivation, the objective of this project was to explore the use of ultrafine aerosol-derived powder of a mixed-conducting ceramic material for fabrication of supported thick-film dense membranes. The project focused on the mixed-conducting ceramic composition SrCo{sub 0. 5 }FeO{sub x} (SCFO) because of the desirable permeability and stability of that material, as reported in the literature. Appropriate conditions to produce the submicron SrCo{sub 0. 5 }FeO{sub x} powder using aerosol pyrolysis were determined. Porous supports of the same composition were produced by partial sintering of a commercially obtained powder that possessed significantly larger particle size than the aerosol-derived powder. The effects of sintering conditions (temperature, atmosphere) on the porosity and microstructure of the porous discs were studied, and a standard support fabrication procedure was adopted. Subsequently, a variety of paste and slurry formulations were explored utilizing the aerosol-derived SCFO powder. These formulations were applied to the porous SCFO support by a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>or</b> spin coating procedure. Sintering of the supported membrane layer was then conducted, and additional layers were deposited and sintered in some cases. The primary characterization methods were X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and room-temperature nitrogen permeation was used to assess defect status of the membranes. We found that non-aqueous paste/slurry formulations incorporating dispersant, plasticizer and binder provided superior cracking resistance compared to simple water, alcohol, or polyethylene glycol (PEG) based formulations. With a formulation employing castor oil as dispersant, isopropyl alcohol/mineral spirits as solvent, polyvinyl butyral as binder, and dibutyl phthalate/PEG as plasticizer, sintered SCFO membrane layers approximately 5 {micro}m thick with no apparent cracks were prepared using spin coating with several coats and sintering cycles. A similar but more viscous formulation applied by <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> gave a {approx} 10 {micro}m thick membrane layer in one coat, but with some apparent cracking. We demonstrated that the membrane layer could be densified while retaining porosity in the chemically identical support. This was accomplished by pre-sintering the support in air (1050 C), which coarsened the grain size and provided a relatively stable plate-shaped granular microstructure, followed by membrane layer fabrication with the highly-sinterable aerosol powder. Final densification was conducted by sintering in nitrogen ({approx} 1100 C), which provided accelerated sintering rates and led to the desired layered perovskite phase content. In spite of these successes, low-temperature pressure-driven permeation testing with N 2 showed that even the best membranes were not sufficiently defect free for high-temperature oxygen permeation testing. The source of these defects were not readily apparent from scanning electron microscopy, though incomplete or nonuniform membrane layer coverage from edge to edge of the support was probably one important factor...|$|R

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} master thesis is to {{investigate}} why the bolts in a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system breaks {{and to find}} a suitable action to prevent this. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system can easily be explained as a scraper that cleans a roll. The scraper moves sideways (oscillates) and the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system along with the roll can be folded back for maintenance work. The work began with collecting relevant data about the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system. When this was done various sources of error {{that may have been}} causing the problems were listed and investigated more closely. Based on these studies, the cause of the failure has been concluded based on the most likely sources of error. The result shows three possible causes of accidents listed below:• A unit performing the oscillating movement that was mounted to the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system could have caused to high strain on the bolts• The movement that is created when the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system and the roll is folded back causes bending in the bearings• Too high load on the roll {{as a result of a}} wrongly adjusted <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> Except these reasons, maintenance routines have been listed as a possible cause. This theory has higher insecurity and need to be investigated closer over a longer period of time. The problem with the oscillating unit is already resolved since it was replaced short before the work started. The folding movement has a unit installed that is meant to make the movement parallel, but this unit is malfunctioning. A suitable complement to this is a measurement system that ensures parallelism. The high load can be resolved by adjusting the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system to the roll. In addition to these proposed actions a suggestion for improvement has been made. This should be done by moving the adjustment for the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> to a more beneficial position. Validerat; 20120623 (anonymous...|$|R

At the current state the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when creping paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled stainless spring steel strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets <b>or</b> section <b>blades.</b> This is not reliable results because the small <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|R
