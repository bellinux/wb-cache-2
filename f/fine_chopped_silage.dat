40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate some of the nutritional properties of maize silage, when fed to rising two year old monozygous twin Jersey and Jersey cross cattle, housed indoors. In a preliminary experiment, silages made from maize harvested with two types of harvester were evaluated in terms of digestibility, rate of passage, {{and the extent of}} kernel loss in the faeces. <b>Fine</b> <b>chop</b> (conventional) <b>silage</b> (mean particle size 1. 24 cm) and coarse <b>chop</b> <b>silage</b> (2. 20 cm) were each fed to six animals at restricted levels of intake. The mean retention times of the fine (44. 6 hours) and coarse (49. 0 hours) <b>chop</b> <b>silages</b> were significantly different (P< 0. 01) but differences between DM digestibilities (62. 7 and 65. 1 % respectively) were not significant. Undigested faecal kernel loss from both silages was negligible. Intakes of the <b>fine</b> <b>chop</b> <b>silage</b> were slightly higher than those of the coarse chop, but this may have been due to its higher dry matter content. In the main experiment maize silage and grass (ryegrass/clover (MP), and Tama (Ta) in separate trials), in the ratios of 100 : 0 (t 1), 80 : 20 (t 2), 45 : 55 (t 3) and 0 : 100 (t 4), were fed ad lib to four groups of four cattle. The experimental layout was a balanced incomplete block design, and the main parameters measured were digestibility and voluntary intake. Digestibilities rose as the proportion of grass in the rations increased. Approximate OM digestibilities for t 2, t 3 and t 4 were 68. 0, 73. 0 and 82. 0 % respectively, however silage (t 1) digestibilities were low, and declined from 65. 4 to 57. 2 % over the duration of the experiment (8 weeks). In most instances, comparisons between t 3 (or t 4) and t 1 were highly significant (P<O. 01). Voluntary intakes of cattle fed the mixed rations were significantly greater than those of animals fed silage (P< 0. 05) or grass alone, and responses to the t 3 ration were greatest when the Tama was used. When Tama was offered the DM intakes (g/kg BW. 75) for t 1, t 2, t 3 and t 4 were 95. 9, 107. 0, 122. 3 and 88. 9, respectively, and when MP was fed corresponding values were 84. 3, 102. 1, 108. 8 and 101. 6. Digestible DM intakes (g/kg BW. 75) of the cattle fed silage (51. 7) were 27 % below those of the cattle fed grass alone (66. 5 for both grasses). Intakes of t 2 (64. 8 (MP), 68. 4 (Ta)) were similar to those of t 4, whereas t 3 resulted in much higher intakes, particularly when Tama was fed (70. 8 (MP), 80. 7 (Ta)). All comparisons between t 1 and the mixed rations were highly significant (P< 0. 01) and the t 1 - t 4 comparisons were significant at P< 0. 025. The results were discussed, and it was concluded that small amounts of fresh pasture can overcome the protein deficiencies of maize silage, and lead to intakes of digestible DM which {{are similar to those of}} cattle fed grass alone. Higher levels of grass supplementation resulted in very high intakes...|$|R

40|$|Preservation of {{forage crops}} as silage offers {{opportunity}} {{to avoid the}} high risk of rain-damaged hay in the humid south-central USA. Recent developments with baled silage or baleage make silage a less expensive option than typical <b>chopped</b> <b>silage.</b> Silage has been important in the region primarily for dairy production, but baleage has become an option for the more extensive beef cattle industry in the region. Silage samples submitted to the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center Forage Quality Lab from 2006 through 2013 were assessed for dry matter (DM) and forage nutritive characteristics of <b>chopped</b> <b>silage</b> and baleage of the different forage types from commercial farms primarily in Louisiana and Mississippi. Of the 1, 308 silage samples submitted, 1, 065 were annual ryegrass (AR) with small grains (SG), the warm-season annual (WA) grasses, sorghums and pearl millet, and the warm-season perennial (WP) grasses, bermudagrass and bahiagrass, providing the remaining samples. Concentration of DM was used to indicate an effective ensiling opportunity, and AR silage was more frequently within the target DM range than was the WA forage group. The AR samples also indicated a high-quality forage with average crude protein (CP) of 130 g/kg and total digestible nutrient (TDN) near 600 g/kg. The cooler winter weather at harvest apparently complicated harvest of SG <b>silage</b> with <b>chopped</b> SG <b>silage</b> lower in both CP and TDN (104 and 553 g/kg, respectively) than either AR silage or baleage of SG (137 and 624 g/kg for CP and TDN, respectively). The hot, humid summer weather along with large stems and large forage quantities of the WA grasses and the inherently higher fiber concentration of WP grasses at harvest stage indicate that preservation of these forage types as silage will be challenging, although successful commercial silage samples of each forage type and preservation approach were included among samples of silages produced in the region...|$|R

40|$|Successful feeding {{strategies}} of periparturient ewes and growing lambs are essential in intensive indoor lamb production. This thesis evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>chopping</b> grass <b>silage</b> and of mixing silage with concentrate on feed intake, dietary selection, chewing behaviour, faecal particle size and performance in pregnant and lactating ewes and in suckling and finishing lambs. In addition, the effects of silage digestibility on feed intake, dietary selection and performance in pregnant and lactating ewes and in suckling lambs were evaluated. Lastly, the effects of feeding whole crop maize silage, harvested at different maturity stages, as the sole forage or combined with grass silage on feed intake, dietary selection, chewing behaviour, faecal particle size and performance in finishing lambs were evaluated. Three experiments were conducted at Götala Beef and Lamb Research Centre, SLU, Sweden. The results show that by <b>chopping</b> grass <b>silage</b> prior to feeding pregnant and lactating ewes, eating time and dietary selection were decreased whereas rumination time was increased. <b>Chopping</b> of <b>silage</b> also increased growth rate of finishing lambs. Mixing of silage and concentrate increased feed intake in lactating ewes and growth rate of suckling lambs, indicating a higher milk yield of the ewes. Furthermore, improved digestibility of grass silage, due to earlier harvest, increased silage intake and body weight in pregnant and lactating ewes and reduced loss of body condition in lactating ewes. Early harvested silage also decreased concentrate intake and increased {{the growth rate of}} the suckling lambs, indicating a higher milk production of the ewes. To optimize feed efficiency, silage of maize harvested at dent stage of maturity should be fed as the only forage, whereas maize harvested at the dough stage could be fed in a mix with grass silage. Feeding maize silage as the sole forage decreased eating and rumination time per unit of intake. Lambs selected particles between 1 and 8 mm and sorted against particles high in fibre. Furthermore, to maximize lamb growth rate, the protein content and quality seem {{to be the most important}} dietary factors. In summary, to maximize production output in intensive lamb production by optimizing feeding, highly digestible <b>chopped</b> grass <b>silage</b> or maize silage harvested at dent stage of maturity should be fed mixed with concentrate...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the relationship between the}} dry matter level or physical form of forage and the quality of silage. One experiment was carried out to find the effect of the dry matter content of forage on the quality of resultant silage. Namely, green oats, of which dry matter was adjusted to five levels (15 ％, 24 ％, 33 ％, 410 ％ and 61 ％) by means of wilting or adding of water, were stored in the experimental silos, respectively. Each silo was opened after 158 days and the fermentative quality and the dry matter loss of silages produced were estimated. And the other experiment was carried out to confirm the relationship between the form of forage and the quality of silage. In this experiment, Italian ryegrass, of which a part was chopped at the length of 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm and the rest. was lacerated and bruised after chopped at 2 cm length, were stored in laboratory miniature-sealed silos, respectively, and then each silo was sealed completely. Of resulant silage, fermentative quality and carotene content were estimated. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) The score by Flieg's appraisal method of the silages was 15 in the silage of 15 ％ dry matter, 58 in the silage of 24 ％ dry matter, 70 in the silage of 33 ％ dry matter and 95 in both silages of 41 ％ and 61 ％ dry matter. And a positive significant correlation, r = + 0. 880 (p< 0. 05), was found between the dry matter level of forage and score by Flieg's appraisal method of silage. 2) The invisible loss of dry matter during storage was more in a low dry matter silage than in a high dry matter silage and the dry matter loss by top spoilage of silage was more in a high dry matter silage than in a low dry matter silage. Therefore, no significant difference of the conservation ratios of edible dry matter between silages was found. 3) The fermentative quality of silages made from fine-chopped grass (1 - 2 cm) was better than that of silages made from rough-chopped grass(5 - 10 cm), and the preserved carotene in the silage was increased by chopping grass. 4) The silages made from lacerated and bruised grass were superior in quality to the <b>chopped</b> <b>silage,</b> and contained the carotene of high level, when compared with the <b>chopped</b> <b>silages.</b> These data suggest that the quality of the silage in affected remarkably by dry matter level and physical form of forage...|$|R

A {{corn silage}} {{harvester}} using a shredding/crushing mechanism was designed, fabricated, and tested during two harvesting {{seasons with the}} objective of improving the feed value of corn silage. Two pairs of toothed rolls turning at different speeds shredded whole-plant corn. Corn stalks were shredded, kernels were broken, and cobs were crushed. Average specific energy required to shred whole-plant corn ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 9 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy for an added flail cutter/blower ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 7 kWh/Mg DM for a total harvester specific energy requirement of 4. 5 to 10. 6 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy requirements for shredding varied significantly among different roll speed treatments at a unit roll force of 15 N/mm (front and rear), but no significant effect of roll speed configuration was found at other unit roll forces. Packed density was lower for shredded <b>silage</b> than for <b>chopped</b> <b>silage,</b> but shredded and chopped samples both ensiled well with pH values of 3. 8 to 4. 1 after fermentation.

40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as round bale silage. Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional hay making equipment and ensiled as large, round bales of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, round bale silage offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with <b>chopped</b> <b>silage,</b> the benefits of round bale silage include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for expendable supplies (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store round bale silage to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of round bale silage made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to round bale silage prevents external molding but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) round bale silage made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state.

Two balanced groups of 20 Limousin bulls (425. 8 +/- 20. 3 kg live weight) each allotted in four pens were given the two diets ad libitum for a finishing period of 138 days. The different dietary roughages did not affect either bull growth performance (average daily gain = 1. 39 +/- 0. 25 kg/day) or food conversion ratio.

At present there are four common types of forage harvesters: flail, double-cut and metered-chop machines and the pick-up wagon equipped {{with a large number}} of knives. Compared with a long chop length, short chopping has a positive influence on losses and silage quality, but this effect decreases with high moisture content, early harvesting, additives, high tower silo, etc. The chop length does not influence digestibility {{as long as it is}} over 10 mm and as long as the ensiling process losses are small. A chopping length shorter than l 0 mm can affect digestibility for cattle and sheep. Several studies show that, for maize <b>silage,</b> a <b>chop</b> length between 5 and 15 mm does not cause any significant difference in losses, conservation quality, or digestibility. According to the studies reviewed, <b>fine</b> <b>chopping</b> (less than 20 mm) increases the intake, especially by sheep, but the effect diminishes with a higher proportion of concentrates in the ration. The influence of chop length in milk, meat, and sheep production was variable in several trials, so that further studies are necessary to explain chopping effect under different conditions. No optimal chop length was determined, but it seems that a length of about 20 mm is better in terms of silage quality and intake.

This study is an effort to evaluate defluoridation efficiency of powdered rice husk, <b>fine</b> <b>chopped</b> rice husk and sawdust by the batch adsorption process. Optimum defluoridation capacity is achieved by optimizing various parameters, viz. dose of adsorbent, pH, contact time and initial concentration. It was found that all three materials can be employed for the defluoridation technique, but powdered rice husk is the best adsorbent {{in the midst of all}} three. Powdered rice husk showed fluoride removal efficiency ranging between 85 and 90  % in the contact period of 7  h only in conditions of all optimized parameter. Following this parameter optimization, adsorption efficiency was also evaluated at natural pH of groundwater to minimize the cost of defluoridation. No significant difference was found between fluoride adsorption at optimized pH (pH =  4) and natural one (pH =  7), which concludes that powdered rice husk can be efficiently used for the defluoridation technique at field scale. The adsorption isotherm using this adsorbent perfectly followed Langmuir isotherms. The value of calculated separation factor also suggests the favourable adsorption of fluoride onto this adsorbent under the conditions used for the experiments. The field application for defluoridation of groundwater using this adsorbent (based on pH of natural groundwater there and seasonal variation of temperature) showed the high success rate.|$|R

Freshly <b>chopped</b> corn <b>silage</b> was untreated Control (CON), or treated with Promote HN- 3 (PHN), Promote LC- 1000 (PLC), or Vigorsile EBL II (VEBL) before packing. Silos were opened at d 30, 60, 90 and 120 d. Averages over all time points, PLC and VEBL reduced pH compared to CON, and PLC had greatest lactic acid concentration and In vitro starch digestibility compared to CON, PHN, and VEBL. Ninety-six PVC mini silos were used to evaluate corn silage fermentation characteristics with four homo- or heterofermentative inoculants. Freshly <b>chopped</b> corn <b>silage</b> was untreated Control (CON), or treated with Promote AP (AP), Promote EBL (EBL), or Promote BP (BP) before packing. Silos were opened at d 30 and 90. After 90 d ensiled, corn silage with BP had higher pH, lower lactate, higher acetate concentration, and increased aerobic stability compared to CON, AP, and EBL. A 2 × 2 factorial randomized block design was used with 17 cows/treatment or 8 primiparous cows/treatment resulting in four treatments; 1) low starch + carrier (LSC), 2) low starch + Propionibacterium freudenreichii strain P 169 (P 169) (LSM), 3) high starch + carrier (HSC), 4) high starch + P 169 (HSM). Starch amount was 15. 5 % and 26. 7 % prepartum and 20. 1 % and 29. 7 % postpartum. Multiparous cows fed HSM produced the greatest milk yield. Milk yield was similar for LSM and HSC. Feed efficiency was increased with P 169. High starch tended to increase 3. 5 % fat corrected milk and energy corrected milk yield in primiparous cows. Also, high starch increased postpartum liver total lipid and triacylglycerol content. A retrospective analysis was conducted using 161 multiparous dairy cows to investigate easily measured, low cost variables correlated to subclinical ketosis in fresh cows. In addition, 328 cows from two commercial dairy farms were utilized to develop a ketosis prediction model (Pre-K) using day of calving data: colostrum yield (CY), body condition score, and parity. An increase in CY correlated {{with an increase in}} beta-hydroxybutrate concentration on d 1 and 7. Pre-K model resulted in a sensitivity of 60 % and specificity of 64 % for predicting cows at risk for ketosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{anti-allergic}} drugs, sodium cromoglycate (SCG), lodoxamide, traxanox, RU 31156 and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol to inhibit IgE-dependent histamine and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) release was assessed using human dispersed lung mast cells. The anti-allergic drugs were weak inhibitors of histamine release, high concentrations (100 - 1000 microM) producing less than 35 % inhibition. Salbutamol produced 39 % inhibition at 10 microM. The efficacy of both SCG and salbutamol was inversely related to the concentration of anti-IgE used for challenge and {{to the degree of}} histamine release. Rapid tachyphylaxis was observed with all anti-allergic drugs but not with salbutamol. Cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and the other anti-allergic drugs, suggesting a common mechanism of action. No cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and salbutamol. SCG was significantly (P less than 0. 001) more effective in inhibiting PGD 2 than it was histamine release. Preferential inhibition of PGD 2 compared with histamine release was less marked (P less than 0. 05) with salbutamol and not significant with the other anti-allergic drugs. Mast cells dispersed by enzymatic digestion of human lung released more histamine on immunological challenge than mechanically dispersed cells obtained by <b>fine</b> <b>chopping</b> of tissue. Enzyme treatment of mechanically dispersed cells removed this difference. Enzymatically and mechanically dispersed cells responded similarly to the inhibitory effects of SCG and salbutamol. Our results suggest that salbutamol is a more effective inhibitor of mediator release from human lung mast cells than anti-allergic drugs. However, with the low levels of mediator release achieved during an allergic reaction in man in vivo, both salbutamol and SCG are likely to be effective inhibitors of both preformed and newly generated mediators...|$|R

Wrapped forages, in {{the form}} of silage and haylage, have become more common in horse diets during recent years. Silage and haylage is {{commonly}} produced in big bales. However, for use in stables with few animals, these bales often contain too much forage to be consumed before onset of aerobic deterioration. Smaller bales are therefore of interest, but knowledge of the chemical composition (including vitamin content), fermentation pattern and changes in those variables during storage of small bales is limited, and was therefore investigated. Small bale forage contained higher pH, higher ethanol and lower lactic acid content, compared to general levels in <b>chopped</b> silo <b>silage,</b> but low levels of ammonia-N and butyric acid. There were no general effects of dry matter or extent of fermentation on α-tocopherol and β-carotene contents in the preserved forages, but linear positive correlations between the vitamins and lactic acid existed. In general, long-term storage (14 months) of small bales influenced fermentation variables, yeasts and pH, but silage wa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The 2003 {{reform of}} the EU Common {{agricultural}} policy introduced a special “energy crop payment” under which a premium of € 45 per hectare is available {{for the production of}} energy crops. There is possibility in Latvia to provide for the use of approximately 0. 36 million ha of the unused now agricultural land for energy crop growing. There are others resources of bioenergy in Latvia as agricultural residues and peat. More than 230 million tones of peat are available for solid biofuel production. Peat can be used as additive for manufacturing of briquettes, because it improves density of herbaceous material briquettes. European countries have standards (ŌNORM 7135, SS 18 71 20 and DIN 51731) concerned with wood pellet and briquette properties. Compacting is necessary operation for solid biofuel production from herbaceous stalk materials because the density of dry herbaceous stalk materials (straw, reeds) is too low (20 – 60 kg m- 3) for transportation on long distances. For density determination of compacted biomass different methods were approved and evaluated. Compacting experiments have been carried out in closed die by means of hydraulic press equipment. Maximum pressure 2330 bar was in closed die. Different roughness stalk material particle briquettes had been obtained. Compositions of particles from roughness group 2 – 3 mm and group with size less, than 0. 25 mm in different weight proportions let obtain density> 1. 0 kg dm- 3 in briquetting, if content of finest particles is> 30 %. The same density (1. 0 kg dm- 3) has been obtained in densification of straw stalk particle fraction 2 – 3 mm and peat particle 20 %. It can be concluded, that <b>fine</b> <b>chopping</b> of stalk materials significantly influence briquetting density. Key words: herbaceous stalk materials, compacting...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of non-protein nitrogen source of urea with barley grain (BG) or corn silage (CS) based diet in Holstein bull calves. Nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation activities, microbial nitrogen yield (MN) and blood metabolites were determined. Holstein bull calves (14), weighing 126 ± 4. 2 kg were allocated in 2 different diets based on BG or CS for 9 weeks. Diets were based on rolled barley grain (BG) and on finely <b>chopped</b> corn <b>silage</b> (CS). Both diets were supplemented with 7. 5 g/kg urea on DM basis. Intake and performance of animal did not differ between diets, whereas digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased in BG diet. Ruminal concentration of propionate and blood glucose concentration increased in BG calves, whereas ruminal pH and acetate concentration increased in CS fed calves. The ruminal NH 3 -N was increased in CS diet, while excretions of allantoin, purine derivatives and estimated MN yield through urine were greater in BG diet vs. CS diet. In conclusion, the results suggested that increased urinary PD excretion and consequently increased estimated MN yield value for BG diet presented more potential for this diet to be synchronized with urea in calves’ rumen digestion...|$|R
50|$|The {{feed and}} bedding uses of corn stover are common, but the plant litter/vegetable manure use is also common. The latter {{is true for}} any {{combination}} of two reasons: (1) it helps to maintain soil health, and (2) when the corn crop {{is used as a}} grain crop (as opposed to a silage crop), harvesting the (grainless) stover simply does not pay; there is often no market demand for it that outweighs its value on the farm as soil maintenance, which represents an economic factor of its own. Regular annual harvesting of the whole corn plant (<b>chopping</b> for <b>silage)</b> is more challenging to soil management than is using the corn as a grain crop and mulching the field with the stover. Reincorporating the organic matter is good for the soil, although it must be managed properly to prevent nitrogen robbery of the next crop, as the high C/N ratio causes available nitrogen (fixed nitrogen) to be hoarded by the soil microbes diligently digesting the cellulose and lignin. They can outcompete the plants for the nitrogen. There are both organic and nonorganic ways to augment the nitrogen supply. Animal urine and manure is the main organic way, whereas commercial fertilizer is the main nonorganic way; both ways provide urea, which the microbes digest with their urease.|$|R
