While some scholars and several WTO members have recently condemned such cartels, others {{have argued that}} they allow efficiency gains that actually promote competition and trade. This paper examines the various issues involved, with special reference to developing countries and to recent discussions on trade and competition policy. After summarising the contending views on <b>export</b> <b>cartels,</b> and also the scanty theoretical literature on the subject, it reviews the treatment of such cartels in various jurisdictions and the limited empirical evidence that is available on their prevalence, efficiency justifications, and effects on international trade. Insights from economic theory are then applied to the arguments for and against <b>export</b> <b>cartels,</b> suggesting criteria that could help to determine their validity and an importing country’s best response. The paper concludes that while importing countries should evaluate foreign <b>export</b> <b>cartels</b> under a “rule of reason”, {{most of them will}} be constrained by a lack of technical expertise and limited enforcement capacity. It suggests a novel approach, based on parallels with anti-dumping procedures, which would strengthen their hands. antitrust, competition policy, trade negotiations, WTO. ...|$|R

Despite these dissimilar antitrust environments, however, market concentration, firms' exercise of market power, and deadweight loss from monopoly are highly similar in the two countries.

40|$|The term export cartels denotes {{agreements}} between companies {{operating in the}} same industry which aim at restricting (or even eliminating) mutual competition in export of the goods (or services) offered on one or more foreign markets. Such dealings are coordinated between independent companies and replace their unconstrained decisions on export of goods or services to foreign markets with an arrangements on prices, production volume or other business parameters. Not all cooperation {{agreements between}} exporters can be deemed to involve <b>export</b> <b>cartel</b> definition. Furthermore, not all export cartels are detrimental per se or even {{from the standpoint of}} importing country. Increased productivity and competition-friendly impact on the export in the source country may also prove beneficial for the consumers of the importing country. This is notably true of the cartels of innovative character that aim at research and development cooperation (R&D cartels). However some forms of cartelizing, both domestic and exporting, bring about particularly negative consequences for the operation of markets (the so-called „hardcore cartels”). The paper examines different forms of the various cartels, presents their typology and analyzes their activities worldwide, providing examples of their operations on the world market.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} granting a fishermen's sales organization exclusive rights to sell unprocessed fish. On {{the assumption that the}} fishermen's monopoly is able to discriminate between plants and end use alternatives in its pricing policy, the conditions for profit maximization are derived and compared with the conditions for social efficiency. It is found that the monopoly would be efficient if (I) its costs for obtaining the fish are identical to the social costs, (2) the marginal processing cost is constant, and (3) either the price of the finished product is constant or the product is exported so that consumer's surplus is {{not a part of the}} social benefit. A fishermen's monopoly may thus achieve the objectives of an <b>export</b> <b>cartel.</b> When the marginal processing cost is rising the monopoly will overconserve the fish resource, provided that its cost of providing the fish is not sufficiently below the social cost. Finally, the analysis is extended to the special case in which processors have established a price discriminating monopoly in the market for finished products but distribute the resulting profit through higher accounting prices while leaving individual processors to decide how much fish to buy for processing. This system passes the benefits from price discrimination in the markets for finished products on to the fishermen's monopoly.

40|$|A presente dissertação objetiva verificar a possibilidade de utilização dos cartéis de exportação tendo em vista o ordenamento jurídico brasileiro. Para tanto, um importante corte metodológico foi realizado: somente questões relativas ao direito constitucional e ao direito concorrencial foram analisadas, deixando-se de lado aquelas que nos são trazidas pelo direito internacional e pela ciência econômica. O trabalho pode ser dividido em três grandes partes. A primeira cuida de justificar a escolha do tema cartéis de exportação. Para tanto, nos valemos da idéia de que as exportações são importante instrumento do qual se valem os Estados para equilibrar a sua atividade econômica e fomentar/financiar o seu desenvolvimento. A segunda parte cuida dos acordos entre concorrentes. Nesse passo, realizamos um pequeno estudo sobre as principais Escolas ideológicas que pretendem interpretar o direito antitruste e apontar a forma correta para a sua aplicação. Em seguida, cuidamos dos cartéis clássicos (os {{hard core}} cartels) e tratamos de diferenciá-los dos demais acordos entre concorrentes. É hora então de cuidarmos especificamente dos cartéis de exportação. Traremos as suas principais características, classificações e os benefícios e malefícios que são apontados pela doutrina. Bem definidos esses instrumentos, adentramos em um terreno bastante inóspito, que é o da forma pela qual os cartéis de exportação são encarados pelos Estados e pelas associações internacionais. Observaremos que, a despeito de serem utilizados por países como os Estados Unidos, existe uma tendência de que sejam tratados como condutas anticompetitivas, a semelhança dos cartéis clássicos. Uma das possíveis justificativas para isso seria a adoção generalizada dos conceitos da Escola de Chicago e das teorias econômicas neoclássicas. A {{principal}} crítica realizada por esses doutrinadores é a de que os cartéis de exportação são formas indevidas de atuação do Estado na economia que alteram as condições naturais de concorrência no mercado internacional. A última parte dessa dissertação está voltada para a inserção de toda a discussão promovida na moldura que nos é trazida pela Constituição Federal de 1988 e pela lei Antitruste brasileira (Lei 8884 / 1994). Para o texto constitucional, nosso enfoque será principalmente o dos artigos 3 ° (objetivos fundamentais da República Federativa do Brasil) e 170 (princípios gerais da atividade econômica). Com relação à lei antitruste, a discussão será voltada para a forma pela qual os cartéis de exportação são disciplinados por nossa lei. The present essay aims {{to verify the}} possibility of using <b>export</b> <b>cartels,</b> considering the Brazilian Law system. For that, an important methodological cut has been done: only matters regarding constitutional law and anti-trust law have been analyzed, leaving apart those matters that are brought to us by the international law and economical science. It can be divided in three big parts. The first one handles the justification for the choice of the subject <b>export</b> <b>cartels.</b> For that, we make use of the idea that the exportations are an important instrument for the Countries to balance their economical activity and stimulate/finance their development. The second part deals with the agreements between competitors. At this pace, we made a small study about the main ideological stream, that intend to understand the antitrust law and identify the correct form for its application. Following that, we mention the classical cartels (the hard core cartels) and differentiate them from the other agreements between competitors. It is time then to handle the <b>export</b> <b>cartels.</b> We mention their main traits, classification, benefits and losses that are pointed by the doctrine. Being those instruments well defined, we enter and uninviting terrain, that is the way that the countries and International Associations face the <b>export</b> <b>cartels.</b> We observe that, despite being used by countries like United States, {{there is a tendency to}} treat it like uncompetitive behavior, resembling the classical cartels. One of the possible explanations for that would be the general adoption of the concepts brought by the Chicago stream and the neoclassical economical theories. The authors main critic is that the <b>export</b> <b>cartels</b> are inappropriate methods of Government intervention in the Economy that alters the natural conditions of the competition in the international market. The last part of such essay is dedicated to the insertion of all the discussion promoted in the patters that are brought to us by the Federal Constitution of 1988 and the Anti-trust Brazilian Law (Law 8884 / 1994). Regarding the constitutional text, our focus in mainly on the 3 rd article (fundamental goals of the Brazilian Federal Republic), and the article 170 (general principles of the economical activity). Regarding the Anti-trust law, the discussion is facing the way that the <b>export</b> <b>cartels</b> are ruled by such area of our legal system...|$|R

The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil <b>exporting</b> <b>cartel,</b> forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980. The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem, and would come to symbolize the crisis among the public in general; the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led to {{a lawsuit against the}} company that year by the Federal Government.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to create more {{consistently}} pro-competitive antitrust policies, many countries have eliminated or restricted antitrust exemptions for firms engaged in export activity. Of the fifty-six countries surveyed, we find only seventeen which offer exporters an exemption from domestic antitrust laws. Thirty-three countries provide no exemption from antitrust laws for export activity, but exempt such activity implicitly: their competition laws are silent on restrictive activities that affect foreign markets. Within the last decade, at least ten countries have rewritten their laws, moving from explicit exemptions to this more passive policy of speaking only to the domestic market. However, the construction of national antitrust laws that ban only activity that harms domestic competition leaves a vacuum in which <b>export</b> <b>cartels</b> can operate with no obvious institution to restrict their activities or limit adverse effects on competition. The elimination of reporting requirements has reduced {{the information that we}} have about their activities. International cooperation to regulate and prosecute collusive activity affecting international markets could rationalize these policies and promote competition more effectively than the current haphazard set of national laws...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship of}} intellectual property rights and competition policies and rules addressing the conduct of private enterprise. Intellectual property rights {{are considered to be}} essential, but not sufficient, conditions for competition. Potentially excessive scope and use need to be balanced by way of competition rules. Such balance is partly inherent to the scope of IPRs and thus within the TRIPs Agreement. Partly, it will be achieved by applying competition rules. The proper balance, it is argued, does not necessarily require the establishment of comprehensive global disciplines on private party conduct and competition in the WTO. A number of reasons and conflicting interests are discussed. The paper argues that the balance can be adequately achieved by way of national or regional anti-trust rules, and efforts to bring about adequate legal regimes in particular in developing and transitional countries should be supported by national and international fora, including the WTO. There is no need at this stage, nor would the World be ready, for global anti-trust regimes and authorities. The paper, however, argues in favour of harmonisation of rules in two major areas: International legal assistance in the prosecution of restrictive business practices and restrictions in WTO law on <b>export</b> <b>cartels.</b> Both areas would considerably enhance the prospects for a balance between IPRs and competition rules, and thus for market access in world trade law...|$|R

40|$|During {{the years}} 1918 – 1973 mutual home market {{protection}} agreements were common, {{for example in}} the Nordic forest industry. According to such agreements, each country abandoned or restricted the export of particular goods to each other’s country. These agreements {{are the focus of}} attention here and have been analysed through archival studies of individual companies, trade associations and the competition authorities. Within the export-intensive sectors, the export went primarily to non-Nordic countries. In those cases, the Nordic home market protection agreements had no apparent impact. However, agreements on home market protection were in several cases signed for goods that were domestic-market oriented and for goods that were exposed to import competition. Although the Nordic home market protection agreements infringed with the EFTA competition rules, many of them remained in force into the 1970 s. Several new agreements were also signed during the late 1960 s. When the 1973 free trade agreements between the EFTA states and European Communities entered into force, the Nordic home market protection agreements were officially abolished. The study shows that there were gentlemen's agreements on home market protection between the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish companies {{until the end of the}} 1980 s. In the business world home market protection was seen as a normal state. Meanwhile, infringements that resulted in conflicts were common. These were often dissolved by renewed or formalised home market protections agreements. In the domestic markets the result of the agreements was eliminated or reduced import competition. At the same time the agreements were seen as a precondition for broader Nordic export collaborations. The study shows that relatively minor offenses against the home market protection agreements could result in collapsing both domestic cartel collaborations and international <b>export</b> <b>cartels...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yoshino {{was born}} {{in what is now}} Ōsaki, Miyagi to a {{merchant}} family. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1913 with a degree in German law, and was accepted into the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. A protégé of Yamamoto Tatsuo, and as one of few members of the ministry with a legal degree, he rose rapidly through the bureaucratic ranks to the post of Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. He was the Japanese resident representative to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. In 1924, he was sent to America and Europe to investigate the chemical industry, and the issue of protective tariffs as chief of the Industrial Policy Section of the Industrial Affairs Bureau [...] In 1925, Yoshino assisted in the creation of new laws which established state-supported <b>export</b> <b>cartels</b> to assist small and medium businesses by regulating competition, thus establishing the basis for a nationally-directed export policy. When the ministry split into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Yoshino stayed with Commerce, and served as Chief of the Documents Section, Director of Public Works, and in 1931 was promoted over several people with higher seniority to become Assistant Secretary of Commerce. He subsequently served as Director of the Patent Office, president of the state-run Tohoku industries, and Tohoku Power. During the 1930s, he was closely assisted by his protégé, Nobusuke Kishi, especially within the semi-independent Temporary Industry Rationality Bureau, which sought increased state influence over industry through implementation of scientific management, standardization of products and production processes, and state subsidies for the production and consumption of domestic products. Yoshino also called for a national system to inspect product quality.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the discussion on the internationalisation of competition law. Within that context the thesis has three objectives: first, to determine the nature of the competition law problems created by commercial globalisation; secondly, to determine whether the existing mix of domestic and international rules is capable of solving those problems; and thirdly, having regard to the conclusions drawn in respect of the previous objectives, to determine the minimum rules required. Competition law is still predominantly domestic law. Business and commerce, however, is increasingly internationalised. This creates tensions that may require an international solution. International competition law issues - international anti-competitive conduct - may be divided into four categories; conduct designed to exclude imports, <b>export</b> <b>cartels,</b> international cartels and international single firm conduct. A fifth category, mergers, is not discussed in this thesis. The regulatory problems differ depending on the category of conduct concerned. This means that unless a broad-based solution is preferred, solutions will vary depending on the category of conduct. International rules, however, should only be sought if existing regulatory approaches are inadequate. If existing approaches are capable of evolving to solve the problems of international anti-competitive conduct, there is no justification for and little prospect of new international rules. To determine this it is necessary to investigate unilateral, bilateral and multilateral approaches. Unilateralism has advantages, but in a shrinking world it is deeply flawed as long as nations have different policies and legal preferences. Regulatory cooperation is evolving, but within a non-binding structure. Some of the problems associated with international anticompetitive conduct are likely to be resistant to non-binding approaches because they involve protectionism. A possibly relevant binding set of multilateral rules already exists {{in the shape of the}} agreements that make up the World Trade Organisation. These may be capable of solving some of the problems of international anti-competitive conduct. However, they will not solve all the problems. For these reasons new rules are required. There are theoretical, practical and institutional reasons why attempts to construct comprehensive rules should be avoided. Any new rules should be the minimum required. This thesis concludes with outline proposals for the minimum rules required to solve the four categories of international anti-competitive conduct...|$|R
40|$|This paper elaborates on {{a number}} of key {{principles}} that need to underpin a coherent and development-friendly architecture for the WTO. The key principles include enlarging the scope of WTO bargaining to include labor flows as well as capital flows; creating a structure that would provide a balance between furthering liberalization and providing some discretion or policy space to accommodate the inevitable political constraints; and minimizing the extent of regulatory harmonization. These principles, while applicable to all countries, may have less immediate relevance in addressing the problems of the least developed countries.

40|$|Estimated future energy {{cost savings}} {{associated}} {{with the development of}} cost-competitive solar thermal technologies (STT) are discussed. Analysis is restricted to STT in electric applications for 16 high-insolation/high-energy-price states. The fuel price scenarios and three 1990 STT system costs are considered, reflecting uncertainty over future fuel prices and STT cost projections. STT R&D is found to be unacceptably risky for private industry in the absence of federal support. Energy cost savings were projected to range from $ 0 to $ 10 billion (1990 values in 1981 dollars), dependng on the system cost and fuel price scenario. Normal R&D investment risks are accentuated because the Organization of Petroleum <b>Exporting</b> Countries (OPEC) <b>cartel</b> can artificially manipulate oil prices and undercut growth of alternative energy sources.

40|$|Stochastic {{simulation}} {{of the direct}} economic costs of oil dependence in an uncertain future is proposed as a useful metric of oil dependence. The market failure from which these costs arise is imperfect competition in the world oil market, chiefly {{as a consequence of}} the use of market power by the Organization of the Petroleum <b>Exporting</b> Countries (OPEC) <b>cartel.</b> Oil dependence costs can be substantial. It is estimated that oil dependence costs to the US economy in 2008 will exceed $ 500 billion. Other costs, such as military expenditures or foreign policy constraints are deemed to be largely derivative of the actual or potential economic costs of oil dependence. The use of quantifiable economic costs as a security metric leads to a measurable definition of oil independence, or oil security, which can be used to test the ability of specific policies to achieve oil independence in an uncertain future.
