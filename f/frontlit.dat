5000|$|Unlike the North American release, the European box {{does not}} feature any {{prominent}} text {{to distinguish the}} backlit models from the older <b>frontlit</b> models. In addition, only the [...] "Surf Blue" [...] color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors [...] "Pink" [...] and [...] "Tribal" [...] had already been released as <b>frontlit</b> models - for these reasons {{it can be very}} difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured {{on the front of the}} box. (The European <b>frontlit</b> models of [...] "Pink" [...] and [...] "Tribal" [...] only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front respectively.) ...|$|E

50|$|Sand {{animation}} is {{the manipulation}} of sand to create animation. In performance art an artist creates a series of images using sand, a process {{which is achieved by}} applying sand to a surface and then rendering images by drawing lines and figures in the sand with one's hands. A sand animation performer will often use the aid of an overhead projector or lightbox (similar to one used by photographers to view translucent films). To make an animated film, sand is moved on a backlit or <b>frontlit</b> piece of glass to create each frame.|$|E

The volume has 10 levels and is controlled via chrome {{button on the}} top {{left side of the}} phone. The base of the phone contains the charger and headset connector. The Nokia 8850 uses GSM 900/1800 and supports Extended GSM 900 band (EGSM) and can automatically switch between bands.

5000|$|The {{design was}} revised {{two years later}} when the Game Boy Advance SP (GBA SP), a more compact version, was released. The SP {{features}} a [...] "clamshell" [...] design (folding open and closed, like a laptop computer), {{as well as a}} <b>frontlit</b> color display and rechargeable battery. Despite the smaller form factor, the screen remained the same size as that of the original. In 2005, the Game Boy Micro was released. This revision sacrifices screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter backlit screen. A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time.|$|E
