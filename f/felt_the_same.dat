25|$|Ross was but {{the most}} wealthy and most visible of many persons in Delaware equally {{sympathetic}} with {{the cause of the}} Confederacy. Most of his peers and neighbors <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, and the strength of their pro-slavery feelings was matched only by awareness that the very existence of Delaware required its membership in a strong Union. Refusing to give up either opinion, the important decisions were simply made elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E

I <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way towards my school companions; I <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards her daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a fortnight!

25|$|In {{an article}} in The Globe and Mail written by Andre Picard on January 9, 1990, she is quoted as saying, “it was morbid and horrible what {{happened}} to Édouard. We thought it was about time someone showed a little respect for his body – and his soul.” Lesperance <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and began plans to have the body returned to Willow Bunch {{the same year as}} his visit to the university. This first attempt failed because university officials claimed that the court would have to decide who had the right to the body. Although Lesperance gained power of attorney to act on behalf of the family, he did not proceed with any legal action at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E

He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman {{came up to me}} and said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way about it after that.' ...|$|E

500|$|The Yoke {{nuclear device}} used a levitated all-uranium-235 core. It was detonated on Aomon just before sunrise on 1 May 1948 at 06:09, a day late due to {{unfavorable}} winds. The observers saw a similar flash and <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> heat as the X-Ray blast, but the [...] wide condensation cloud was larger, {{and the sound}} of the explosion more forceful. One observer likened it to the sound of [...] "a paper bag which is forcefully burst in a small room". They were correct: its yield of 49 kilotons made it the largest nuclear detonation up to that time, but it was considered inefficient and wasteful of the fissile material.|$|E
500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, {{that was the last}} time I played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump at the beginning of the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E

Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, {{it just seemed like}} there was no way it could fail.

500|$|Taraborrelli was proven wrong, and, in 1990, he {{considered}} writing her biography, but put the thought aside, thinking such a venture was premature. He {{pointed out that}} [...] "most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths, before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper. Madonna was in an ambitious, self-involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career." [...] He picked up the writing again in 1994, but <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way about her, and hoped the time would come when the singer would focus on her personal life, rather than her career. A personal evolution occurred in her life {{with the birth of}} daughter Lourdes in 1996, and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography.|$|E
500|$|All of Audioslave's lyrics {{were written}} by Cornell, while all four members—as a band—were {{credited}} with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as [...] "more collaborative" [...] and [...] "satisfying" [...] than Rage Against the Machine's, which was [...] "a battle creatively." [...] Cornell also <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way; he saw Soundgarden's songwriting method inferior to Audioslave's. Rick Rubin, producer of the band's first two albums, was also lauded as [...] "a great collaborative partner" [...] and was likened to [...] "the fifth Beatle" [...] by Tom Morello. The time spent on songwriting by the band was always short. They wrote 21 songs in 19 days for the first album and exceeded that rate for the second album by having a song or sometimes two written every day. This method was adopted for the third album as well.|$|E
500|$|The Earl {{inherited}} {{the title of}} Marquess of Bristol after his father died on 10 March 1985. Though his father had sold Ickworth House to the National Trust in 1956, {{he was allowed to}} continue living there in the house's East Wing as part of the conditions. Following the collapse of his marriage, the Marquess became increasingly volatile. He blamed some of his difficulties on what he called [...] "bad blood" [...] and a [...] "family disposition to depression". According to the Marquess, his father and mother both suffered from manic depression (now known as bipolar disorder) and he <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> though he appreciated that years of cocaine abuse had not helped matters. During this time, he saw his mother regularly, who was living in nearby Newmarket, using a helicopter to travel between there and Ickworth.|$|E

500|$|Foraker was {{initially}} {{convinced of the}} guilt of the men, but reconsidered after evidence obtained in a private investigation by progressive organizations was presented to him (the black attorney presenting it was denied an audience with Roosevelt). [...] According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, [...] "Foraker had a passion for racial justice." [...] Recalling Foraker's desire, as a soldier, to see slavery abolished and the black man given the same {{civil and political rights}} as the white man, Morris explains, [...] "Senator Foraker merely <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about the Constitution in 1906 as Private Foraker had felt in 1862." [...] In addition to his desire to see justice done, Foraker also saw political advantage in opposing Roosevelt over the Brownsville issue; he might boost his own presidential ambitions for 1908 by making both Roosevelt and his designated heir apparent, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, look bad.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine was {{favorable}} in {{his review}} of Box Car Racer, writing, [...] "Neither genre-obsessed nor intent on defying convention, Box Car Racer is the perfect union between pop-punk riffs and instrumentation that spans all rock genres from indie to folk. Finally, we have a pop band that is attempting {{to take advantage of}} the potential of its instruments." [...] Adam Dlugacz of PopMatters summarized Box Car Racer as [...] "pretty fantastic hardcore/emo/punk rock album. It seems to re-affirm the band's roots while proving that they are capable of more than the by-the-numbers approach of Blink. On the other hand, there's no reason this couldn't have been a Blink-182 album." [...] Robert Morast from Argus Leader <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> commenting, [...] "The music is good with brooding melodies that fester inside the soul. But for DeLonge, it just sounds like he's lost searching for his other half." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Hungry Earth" [...] and {{the second}} part, [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up the fourth {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. In an interview, Syal stated that they did the location filming first. The drill itself was automatic and done by computer. For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground, Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment. Two pieces of rubber were {{at the opening of}} the compartment which expanded as she lowered herself down. A layer of soil was spread across the rubber; Gillan's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears. Gillan, initially scared at performing the stunt, put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she thought it could have been handled better.” ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna {{was killed}} during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking {{four years after the}} Brazilian's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had [...] "always refused to speak about him". When Senna died, Prost stated that [...] "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together. Senna had also <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he {{admitted}} to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only {{a couple of days before}} his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: [...] "A special hello to my,... to our dear friend Alain. We all miss you Alain." [...] Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way”.|$|E
