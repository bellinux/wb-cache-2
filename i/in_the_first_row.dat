5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>row</b> (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E

[...] The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row.

He recalls, [...] "I sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>row</b> and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared." [...] Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. [...] When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. [...] The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. [...] After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. [...] He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.
