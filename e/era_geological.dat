40|$|In spring 2008, Tethys Petroleum {{started a}} {{programme}} {{to explore the}} 35, 000 square kilometre Bokhtar area of Tajikistan, {{an area the size}} of Switzerland and equally mountainous. Existing conventional oil company data in the area consisted mainly of elderly Soviet <b>era</b> <b>geological</b> maps, well logs and very sparse dubious seismic, all in paper format. The size and remote nature of the area made it an ideal candidate for remote sensing technology and 3 D visualisation, which were used to plan the field geology and seismic acquisition and to complete the first phase of the exploration programme on time. BGS used GeoVisionary™ software in an immersive suite to produce the three-dimensional visualisation. A rear projected screen with stereo viewing glasses allied to the ‘Geometry’ tools were used to digitise new geological linework as shapefiles onto 3 D perspective views of the terrain. This functionality was also used to plan the field traverses in order to maximise the time in the field...|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Ecuadorian Andes {{are divided}} into three parallel cordilleras which run in what is similar to an S-shape from north to south: the western, central (Cordillerra Real) and eastern (Cordillera Occidental) cordilleras. The cordilleras were formed earlier in the Cenozoic <b>era</b> (the current <b>geological</b> <b>era),</b> as the Nazca Plate has subducted underneath the South American Plate and has raised the mountain range. In the south, the cordilleras are not well defined.|$|R

40|$|Though many {{scientists}} and scholars {{of the environmental}} humanities are referring to the current <b>geological</b> <b>era</b> as the anthropocene, this article argues {{that there are some}} problems with this trope and the narrative that emerges from it. First, responsibility for the current era of climate weirding is not shared equally, some humans are way more responsible than others. Second, the claim of the anthropocene works rhetorically to maintain a sense of human exceptionalism {{from the rest of the}} evolution of life on the planet. Third and finally, the suggestion that this <b>geological</b> <b>era</b> be named the anthropocene suggests that the problem and the solution to our ecological crisis lie with Homo sapiens. Does this not re-create the sense of mastery that has fueled contemporary planetary ills in the first place? This paper argues that the idea of agency must be reconfigured and redistributed throughout the planetary community in order to deal with the wicked problems arising from climate weirding and an uncertain future...|$|R
