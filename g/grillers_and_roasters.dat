2500|$|Braising {{pans and}} {{roasting}} pans (also known as braisers <b>and</b> <b>roasters)</b> are large, wide and shallow, to provide space {{to cook a}} roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers <b>and</b> <b>roasters</b> – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|R

Every inch is retail space, even the underpasses taking people from the ferries are lined with shops, kebab <b>grillers</b> <b>and</b> boys selling cigarettes. Predictably there is a fair amount of purse-snatching and pickpocketing in the crowds. And the narrow streets are hard to keep clean.|$|R

5000|$|The {{third wave}} of coffee is a {{movement}} to produce high-quality coffee, and consider coffee as an artisanal foodstuff, like wine, rather than a commodity. This involves improvements at all stages of production, from improving coffee plant growing, harvesting, and processing, to stronger relationships between coffee growers, traders, <b>and</b> <b>roasters,</b> to higher quality and fresh roasting, at times called [...] "microroasting" [...] (by analogy with microbrew beer), to skilled brewing.|$|R

The Max Havelaar seal, which was based on a fictional character, was established [...] "to license existing <b>roasters</b> <b>and</b> retailers who complied with its fair trade criteria" [...] (Alverado, 2009). The seal provided specific benefits for cooperatives of small coffee producers in Mexico, with the aim of balancing the production of crops to be exported, as well as crops for the local population.

Hedonic price equations reveal that the Cup of Excellence auction is a more differentiated market disclosing more information about coffee values associated with ratings, rankings, quantities available, and country reputations whereas information in the Q auction is more limited and tends to be remunerated to a lesser extent.

Turkey drumsticks, baking hens, <b>and</b> <b>roasters</b> were {{injected with}} either 3 or 5 % (based upon {{weight of the}} meat) of a marinade containing. 05 % papain. After injection, the meat was allowed to equilibrate for 2 hr at 4 C and then oven baked or cooled in a microwave oven. All meat products injected with papain were significantly more tender (shear press and taste panel) than the controls. Products injected with 5 % marinade were more tender than those injected with 3 % marinade. Sensory characteristics were unaffected by the papain.
