5|$|A {{total of}} 22 Italian Tornados were {{deployed}} in the NATO-organised Operation Allied Force over Kosovo in 1999, the IDS variant was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> role while the ECR variants patrolled the combat region, acting to suppress enemy anti-aircraft radars, firing 115 AGM-88 HARM missiles. In response to anticipated violence during the 2010 Afghanistan elections, Italy, along with several other nations, increased its military commitment in Afghanistan, dispatching four IDS Tornados to the region.|$|E

5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|Children {{were also}} {{affected}} through {{the loss of}} parents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death {{of one of the}} at least ten orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, {{during the}} Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. A two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E

5|$|SS Mauna Loa was a steam-powered {{cargo ship}} of Matson Navigation Company that was sunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Darwin in February 1942. She was christened SS West Conob in 1919 and renamed SS Golden Eagle in 1928. At {{the time of}} her {{completion}} in 1919, the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Conob (ID-4033) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The British Royal Air Force {{carried out}} two bombing raids on Sofia, {{the capital of}} Bulgaria, in {{retaliation}} for the attacks on Yugoslavia. The invasion resulted in the surrender of Yugoslav forces on 17 April. The senior Luftwaffe officer responsible for the bombing was captured by the Yugoslavs {{at the end of the}} war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{design was}} {{tested in the}} Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Project Y {{personnel}} formed pit crews and assembly teams for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> as weaponeers and observers. After the war ended, the laboratory supported the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. A new Z Division was created to control testing, stockpiling and bomb assembly activities, which were concentrated at Sandia Base. The Los Alamos Laboratory became Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the attack, Spanish police {{released}} the picture of six members of ETA who could have possibly taken part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Police named the suspects as Itziar Martínez Moreno, Iratxe Yáñez Ortiz de Barrón, Alberto Beraza Machain, Oroitz Gurruchaga Gogorza, Joanes Larretxea Mendiola and Iván Sáez de Jáuregui Ortigosa, although no direct evidence linked them to the attack. Meanwhile, at least 1600 police officers were deployed to keep checking around the island, including on fisherman. The intense search was still active in mid August.|$|E
5|$|The first {{production}} batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered {{the first batch}} of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where he handed it over to another courier, who {{took it to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. Plutonium from Hanford would be used in the Fat Man bomb used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Nagasaki. For his wartime services, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} {{defendants}} were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab.

5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|From early 1944, No. 266 Squadron {{took part}} in ground attack {{operations}} over the Channel and northern France, operating from RAF Harrowbeer in Devon. The squadron also escorted Allied bombers embarking on or returning from raids, protecting them from German fighters. Larger petrol tanks were fitted to the Typhoons to increase their range. In May 1944 the squadron was visited by the Prime Minister, who had been knighted and was now Sir Godfrey Huggins. Over the next month, {{in preparation for the}} imminent Allied invasion of Normandy, the Rhodesian aircraft took on a fighter-bomber role, flying sorties across the channel twice a day and participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of bridges, roads, railways and the like.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John would talk to him about Maya for hours at a time. However, after he was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E

5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
5|$|Parsons participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, {{flying on}} the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and {{carefully}} {{carried out the}} procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, {{who was in charge}} of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For his work on the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
