He argues for honesty to oneself and suggests the landscape, a still life or even animals allow for a bit of fudging so he spends much time working from the nude model. Todd writes [...] "Why the Nude?

40|$|Abstract One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in machine learning and pattern recognition is to develop appropriate representations for complex data. We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low dimensional manifold embedded in a high <b>dimensional</b> space. <b>Drawing</b> on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed. 1 Introduction In many areas of artificial intelligence, information retrieval and data mining, one is often confronted with intrinsically low dimensional data lying in a very high dimensional space. Consider, for example, gray scale images of an object taken under fixed lighting conditions with a moving camera. Each such image would typically be represented by a brightness value at each pixel.

The construction lines frame potential represented space, which are projected from one drawing type to the next in order to clarify a proposed spatial construct.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{hierarchical}} force-directed method for drawing large graphs. The algorithm produces a graph embedding in an Euclidean space E of any dimension. A {{two or three}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> of the graph is then obtained by projecting a higher-dimensional embedding into a two or three dimensional subspace of E. Projecting high-dimensional drawings onto two or three dimensions often results in drawings that are "smoother" and more symmetric. Among the other notable features of our approach are the utilization of a maximal independent set filtration of the set of vertices of a graph, a fast energy function minimization strategy, efficient memory management, and an intelligent initial placement of vertices. Our implementation of the algorithm can draw graphs {{with tens of thousands}} of vertices using a negligible amount of memory in less than one minute on a mid-range PC...|$|E
