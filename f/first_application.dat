5|$|In 2011, the European Medicines Agency {{granted a}} {{marketing}} authorisation for a buccal application form of midazolam, sold under the trade name Buccolam.

5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its <b>first</b> <b>application</b> came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E
5|$|Holden began {{assembling}} the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a {{development of the}} Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research had shown {{that there was a}} business case for such a model. The LC Torana was the <b>first</b> <b>application</b> of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission. This was the result of Holden's A$16.5million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia factory for its production.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1920s, X-ray {{diffraction}} {{has been}} the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of X-ray crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The <b>first</b> <b>application</b> of X-ray crystallography to metallurgy likewise occurred in the mid-1920s. Most notably, Linus Pauling's structure of the alloy Mg2Sn led to his theory of the stability and structure of complex ionic crystals.|$|E
