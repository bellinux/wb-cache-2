Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E

25|$|At {{a debate}} of <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC's Tim Russert cited {{a passage from}} a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO {{from her home in}} Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine's {{assertion}} was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former U.S. president Jimmy Carter had. Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans say they have witnessed a UFO.|$|E

25|$|The {{urgent need}} to address climate change {{was one of the}} primary factors {{motivating}} Lessig to run for president. He supports a carbon tax on companies that are not able to clean the pollution that they have created. He also supports the other policies <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> have proposed, but he argues that a carbon tax would render most of them unnecessary. He also argues that enacting the Citizen Equality Act is essential to make addressing climate change possible because fossil fuel interests are currently using their unequal influence to block it.|$|E
25|$|MRC {{released}} a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC's methodology as flawed. During the 2008 US presidential election, MRC {{released a}} report that claimed {{that the vast majority}} of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a positive slant. MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having David Gregory replace Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell and others who have accused the network of liberal bias.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, it was {{reported}} that McCain had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including Tim Johnson, who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate Democrats could sometimes delay votes in order to accommodate the schedules of <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates.</b>|$|E

25|$|Though Dean lagged {{in early}} endorsements, he {{acquired}} many critical ones as his campaign snowballed. By {{the time of}} the Iowa caucuses, he led among commitments from superdelegatesâ€“ elected officials and party officers entitled to convention votes by virtue of their positions. On November 12, 2003, he received the endorsements of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Dean received the endorsement of former Vice President and 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore, on December 9, 2003. In the following weeks Dean was endorsed by former U.S. senators Bill Bradley and Carol Moseley Braun, unsuccessful <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> from the 2000 and 2004 primaries, respectively.|$|E
25|$|At the Iowa Democratic Party State Convention, on {{the other}} hand, 16 pledged delegates {{proportionally}} represented the candidates' support. Ten of these delegates were designated as at-large, meaning that they represent the entire state as a whole. The other six were referred to as Party Leaders and Elected Officials (PLEO). These may include members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, the Governor, and former party leaders. Not all of the PLEOs were pledged, but if they were, they would represent {{the state as a}} whole along with the at-large delegates. In total, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> were allocated a total of 45 pledged delegates, depending on their support in each district and in the state.|$|E
25|$|Democrats {{are no less}} {{dominant}} at {{the federal}} level. <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> have only failed to carry Davidson County five times since reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988. In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat Al Gore carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state. In the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry carried Nashville with 55% of the vote even as George W. Bush won the state by 14 points. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Nashville with 60% of the vote even as Republican John McCain won Tennessee by 15 points.|$|E

25|$|After disenfranchisement of blacks, the GOP (U.S. Republican Party) in Tennessee was {{historically}} a sectional party {{supported by}} whites {{only in the}} eastern part of the state. In the 20th century, except for two nationwide Republican landslides of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee narrowly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox, and in 1928, when it more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith, a Catholic), the state was part of the Democratic Solid South until the 1950s. In that postwar decade, it twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II. Since then, more of the state's voters have shifted to supporting Republicans, and <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> have carried Tennessee only four times.|$|E
25|$|Though 8 {{million workers}} {{remained}} unemployed in 1936, economic conditions had improved since 1932 and Roosevelt was widely popular. An attempt by Huey Long and other individuals {{to organize a}} left-wing alternative to the Democratic Party collapsed after Long's death in 1935. Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority. The Republicans nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a well-respected but bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover. While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved {{of the goals of}} the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation. In the 1936 presidential election, Roosevelt and Garner won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont. The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote and the electoral vote since the 1820 presidential election. Congressional Democrats also expanded their majorities, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in both houses of Congress. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic {{for the first time since}} the Civil War.|$|E
