5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just four days before the murders, <b>Kovář</b> had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, <b>Kovář</b> visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and <b>Kovář</b> left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|According to the Uherský Brod mayor , 's {{family members}} tried to prevent <b>Kovář</b> from having the license renewed by {{pleading}} with his general practitioner not to grant him the necessary health clearance, since they felt threatened and considered him mentally unstable. Nevertheless, <b>Kovář</b> received clearance from his general practitioner and presented it {{as a part}} of his license renewal application on 19 January 2015.|$|E

5|$|Authorities {{received}} the first distress {{call from a}} person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47pm. The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ75 that was also used by <b>Kovář),</b> body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in car. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. , taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door, opened fire on the officers {{as soon as they}} entered. The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and the shooter. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered the exits, and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit.

25|$|In January 2010, Joey <b>Kovar,</b> {{spurred by}} the {{impending}} birth of his and his girlfriend's child, appeared on the third season of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, where he sought help for his addiction to cocaine, ecstasy and alcohol. After completing treatment, he indicated that after helping his girlfriend, Nikki, move into their new home, he would get a sponsor, go to meetings, {{and go to a}} sober living facility. A year after his girlfriend gave birth to their son, Kovar's daughter was born. On August 17, 2012, 29-year-old <b>Kovar</b> was found dead at a friend's home near Chicago. Autopsy results were inconclusive, and {{the cause of death was}} pending a toxicological test as of August 18, though police stated that no foul play was indicated, and Kovar's brother, David, denied that drugs were the cause, as he stated that <b>Kovar</b> was maintaining his sobriety. The cause of death was later to be known as an opiate intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped <b>Kovář's</b> assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe shock {{response}} and spall strength of Kovar®, an alloy of Fe- 29 Ni- 17 Co, are obtained using a single stage powder gun to achieve pressures between 6 and 55 GPa by performing symmetric, planar impact tests. Above ~ 6. 5 GPa, the behavior shifts from a dispersive, continuous pressure {{rise to a}} shock, and it is shown that the material displays anomalous behavior at low pressures. Above 6. 5 GPa, the Hugoniot is described by a linear relationship between shock and particle velocity of US= 2. 06 UP+ 3. 54 km/s. The spall strength, an engineering description of the spall phenomenon, was calculated and shown to increase from 3. 6 - 7. 4 GPa as stress increases from 6 - 55 GPa, and it is shown that the method of spall strength computation has a large effect. From previous studies on the iron-nickel system, the authors expected to observe evidence of an α → E phase transition in the material but did not. Upon examining the shock and metallurgical literature, high concentrations of Ni and Co will have competing effects on the phase transition, but the effect of Ni will likely dominate and decrease the phase transition pressure. Further experiments on the high alloy Fe-Ni-Co system are needed to understand <b>Kovar's</b> complex low pressure mechanical behavior...|$|R
25|$|The {{windows of}} the photomultipliers act as {{wavelength}} filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care {{has to be taken}} for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than <b>kovar</b> (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to <b>kovar),</b> a graded seal needed between the window {{and the rest of the}} tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.|$|E
25|$|Crimean Tatars stormed into Hungary and pillaged the Partium in June 1594, forcing Bocskai {{to stay in}} Várad. Sigismund Báthory convoked the Diet, but {{the delegates}} of the Three Nations of Transylvania refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire. Taking {{advantage}} of the prince's failure, Balthasar Báthory persuaded him to abdicate in late July. Sigismund went to <b>Kővár</b> (now Remetea Chioarului in Romania), and then announced {{that he wanted to}} move to Italy. Ferenc Kendi and Kovacsóczy prevented Balthasar from securing the princely throne for himself.|$|E
25|$|Bocskai and {{the other}} commanders of the army hurried to <b>Kővár,</b> where they and Friar Carillo {{convinced}} Sigismund to change his mind. Bocskai and his troops accompanied Sigismund back to Kolozsvár, forcing the delegates of the Three Nations to again pay homage to him on 27August. A day later, fifteen leaders of the opposition were arrested at the prince's order. In a few days, many of them (including Balthasar Báthory and Farkas Kovacsóczy) were executed or murdered. Years later, Sigismund Báthory told Ferenc Nádasdy that Bocskai had forced him to order their execution. Most historians also say that Bocskai {{was responsible for the}} purge, which made him his nephew's most influential advisor.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on <b>kovar</b> sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E

McGee further explained that this was an unhealthy environment for her to live in, and that the stress and manipulation of the production exacerbated her illness.
