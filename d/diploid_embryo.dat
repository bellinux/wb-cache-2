2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{combinations}} that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> and ES cells, <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> and <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo,</b> ES cell and tetraploid embryo, <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> or injection of the stem cells into the <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo.</b> If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for. [...] ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells. This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.|$|E

Many studies have provided reliable evidence that the transcription levels of reference genes are not constant at different developmental stages and in different experimental conditions.

Injections of ESCs into <b>diploid</b> <b>embryos</b> could theoretically generate chimeric mice that are derived from both ESCs and host embryos. However, this outcome is not applicable to the injection of ESCs into the 4 - or 8 -cell embryos that can produce the ES-mice. The host embryo does not {{contribute to}} the fetal development in this method, which is similar to the tetraploid embryo that only contributes to extraembryonic tissues, such as the placenta (Eakin and Behringer, 2003). These results demonstrate that exogenous ESCs injected into 4 - or 8 -cell stage embryos {{have an impact on the}} host embryo developmental fate. Mouse ESCs injected into 8 -cell stage embryos modified the pattern of cell lineage specification (Humiecka et al., 2016), which supports this view. However, it has not yet been completely elucidated how donor ESCs regulate the embryo developmental fate. Recent reports have indicated that ESCs or differentiating ESC-secreted proteins may affect the growth and development of exogenous cells, such as cell migration and myogenesis (Ngangan et al., 2014; Yousef et al., 2014). Therefore, we hypothesized that ESC-secreted proteins may affect the embryo developmental fate following the injection of ESCs into embryos.|$|R

30|$|In {{flowering}} plants, successful {{seed set}} {{depends on the}} success of double fertilization, which results in the formation of a healthy seed and hence the coordinated development of the resultant <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo,</b> triploid endosperm, and maternal ovule (the integuments ultimately constitute the seed coat). Each part of a seed represents a different genetic origin [39, 58]. This unique aspect of the seed makes its developmental pattern different from that of other plant organs, such as the shoot, root, or leaf. In monocots, such as cereals, and some dicots, the endosperm cells contribute the major volume of the mature seed and supply nutrients to the embryo upon germination, while, in Arabidopsis and many other dicots, the endosperm cells eventually degenerate and are replaced by the embryo. However, in all cases, the initial growth of the endosperm is the major determinant of seed growth [69]. Moreover, the final sizes of plant organs, including seeds, are primarily defined by internal developmental signals [45, 53, 54]. A summary of our knowledge of genetic and molecular regulation of seed size follows.

One of the epigenetic modifications thought {{to be involved in}} genomic imprinting is DNA methylation. Here we show that the maternally imprinted genes Snrpn and Peg 1 /Mest were nearly unmethylated or heavily methylated, respectively, in their differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at the two-cell stage in parthenogenetic embryos. However, both genes were gradually de novo methylated, with almost complete methylation of all CpG sites by the morula stage in parthenogenetic embryos. Unexpectedly, another maternally imprinted gene, Peg 3, showed distinct dynamics of methylation during preimplantation development of <b>diploid</b> parthenogenetic <b>embryos.</b> Peg 3 showed seemingly normal methylation patterns at the two-cell and morula stages, but was also strongly de novo methylated in parthenogenetic blastocysts.

40|$|Proper {{development}} of a seed requires coordinated exchanges of signals among the three components that develop {{side by side in}} the seed. One of these is the maternal integument that encloses the other two zygotic components, i. e., the <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> and its nurturing annex, the triploid endosperm. Although the formation of the embryo and endosperm contains the contributions of both maternal and paternal parents, maternally and paternally derived alleles may be expressed differently, leading to a so-called parent-of-origin or imprinting effect. Currently, the nature of how genes from the maternal and zygotic genomes interact to affect seed development remains largely unknown. Here, we present a novel statistical model for estimating the main and interaction effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are derived from different genomes and further testing the imprinting effects of these QTLs on seed development. The experimental design used is based on reciprocal backcrosses toward both parents, so that the inheritance of parent-specific alleles could be traced. The computing model and algorithm were implemented with the maximum likelihood approach.

40|$|In angiosperms, double {{fertilization}} of an egg cell and a central cell with two sperm cells {{results in the}} formation of a seed containing a <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> and a triploid endosperm. The extent to which the embryo sac controls postfertilization events in the seed is unknown. The novel gametophytic maternal-effect maize mutation, baseless 1 (bsl 1) affects central cell development within the embryo sac, frequently by altering the position of the two polar nuclei. Despite this irregularity, fertilization is as efficient as in wild type. The spatial expression of basal endosperm-specific transcripts is altered in free-nuclear and cellular mutant endosperms. At later stages of seed development, bsl 1 predominantly affects development of the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL). When bsl 1 /+ diploid plants were pollinated by wild-type tetraploid plants, the BETL abnormalities observed in bsl 1 /bsl 1 /+/+ tetraploid endosperms were diverse and of variable severity. Moreover, the frequency of kernels with severely perturbed BETL development correlated with the percentage of severely affected bsl 1 central cells. Therefore, BSL 1 is likely required in the central cell before fertilization for correct BETL patterning to occur.

Instead, conception is a forty-eight hour process, during which the haploid genomes of the sperm and egg are gradually and precisely transformed into the functioning diploid genome of a new human embryo. During that two-day period, many common clinical and laboratories activities take place, including the culling of unsuitable embryos, the freezing of others, and the testing of embryos for genetic abnormalities. The legal status of these activities will turn on the point in the two-day process of conception that is chosen to trigger the life-begins-at-conception laws. In this article, I argue that laws triggered by conception should not take effect until the process of conceiving a new <b>diploid</b> <b>embryo</b> is complete. This occurs when the embryonic genome begins to function, roughly forty-eight hours after insemination, at the eight-cell stage. Prior to that, a new human life is being conceived, but has not yet been conceived. Although many people will find this a surprising conclusion, it is consistent with both the gradual nature of the transformation from gametes to embryo and with the goals that the authors of these laws sought to accomplish...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly and {{efficiently}} generate reliable Cre/loxP conditional transgenic mice would greatly complement global high-throughput gene targeting initiatives aimed at identifying gene {{function in the}} mouse. We report here the generation of Cre/loxP conditional ROSA 26 -targeted ES cells within 3 - 4 weeks by using Gateway cloning to build the target vectors. The cDNA of the gene of interest can be expressed either directly by the ROSA 26 promoter providing a moderate level of expression or by a CAGG promoter placed in the ROSA 26 locus providing higher transgene expression. Utilization of F 1 hybrid ES cells with exceptional developmental potential allows the production of germ line transmitting, fully or highly ES cell-derived mice by aggregation of cells with <b>diploid</b> <b>embryos.</b> The presented streamlined procedures accelerate the examination of phenotypical consequences of transgene expression. It also provides a unique tool for comparing the biological activity of polymorphic or splice variants of a gene, or products of different genes functioning in the same or parallel pathways in an overlapping manner.

40|$|Tetraploid mouse embryos were {{produced}} by cytochalasin B treatment. These embryos usually die before completion of embryonic development and are abnormal morphologically and physiologically. The tetraploid embryos can be rescued to develop to maturity by aggregating them with normal <b>diploid</b> <b>embryos</b> to produce diploid/tetraploid chimeric mice. The diploid/tetraploid chimeric embryos are frequently abnormal: {{the larger the}} proportion of tetraploid cells, the greater the abnormality. By karyotype analysis and {{by the use of}} appropriate pigment cell markers, we have demonstrated that two of our surviving chimeras are in fact diploid/tetraploid chimeras. One surviving chimera is retarded in growth and displays neurological abnormalities. The coat color chimerism suggests that this chimera is about 50 % tetraploid. Another chimera with about 10 % tetraploid pigment cells in the coat is only slightly retarded in growth and is a fertile male. Tetraploid cells are distributed in many, if not all, tissues of embryos but evidently are physiologically inadequate to support completely normal development and function in the absence of substantial numbers of normal diploid cells...|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of a diagnosis in PGD is not always straightforward. The criteria used for choosing the embryos to be replaced after FISH or PCR results are not equal in all centres.In the case of FISH, in some centres only embryos are replaced that {{are found to be}} chromosomally normal (that is, showing two signals for the gonosomes and the analysed autosomes) after the analysis of one or two blastomeres, and when two blastomeres are analysed, the results should be concordant. Other centres argue that embryos diagnosed as monosomic could be transferred, because the false monosomy (i.e. loss of one FISH signal in a normal dipoloid cell) is the most frequently occurring misdiagnosis. In these cases, there is no risk for an aneuploid pregnancy, and normal <b>diploid</b> <b>embryos</b> are not lost for transfer because of a FISH error. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} embryos diagnosed as monosomic on day 3 (except for chromosomes X and 21), never develop to blastocyst, which correlates with the fact that these monosomies are never observed in ongoing pregnancies.|$|R
