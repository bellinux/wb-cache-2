40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} acrylate-based adhesive tapes contain significant amounts of silicone impurities. Here, those adhesive tapes were used on steel substrates and the gluing process was studied by the method of fluorescence microscopy. The {{results of this study}} show that silicone contamination does not cause any significant depression in adhesive properties. During the gluing process, silicon oil films shrink and direct contacts between the adhesive and the substrate and, therefore, strong bonding become possible. The authors believe that steel substrates are typical of all polar surfaces and plan to prove this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{reported}} different restenosis rates for various stent designs. It is speculated that stentinduced strain concentrations on the arterial wall lead to tissue injury, which initiates restenosis. This hypothesis needs further investigations including better quantifications of non-uniform strain distribution on the artery following stent implantation. A non-contact surface strain measurement method for the stented artery {{is presented in}} this work. ARAMIS stereo optical surface strain measurement system uses two optical high speed cameras to capture the motion of each reference point, and resolve three dimensional strains over the deforming surface. As a mesh stent is deployed into a latex vessel with a random contrasting pattern sprayed or drawn on its outer surface, the surface strain is recorded at every instant of the deformation. The calculated strain distributions can then be used to understand the local lesion response, validate the computational models, and formulate <b>hypotheses</b> for <b>further</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>study...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{limbic system}} (the {{collective}} {{term for the}} brain structures that are the centers of emotion and moti-vation) functions in interesting ways in responding to music. Research into {{the question of the}} physiological effect of music on the limbic area of the brain may give insight into human emotional response to music. Insights gained from this study might provide a more thorough understanding of affective responses of human subjects to music. Howard Gardner addressed the importance of the study of emotional response to the arts in this way: Given the difficulty of determining feeling life, why introduce it into a discussion of artistic development? The answer [...] . is that feeling life has been regarded universally as a crucial component of the artistic process; any discussion of the arts that takes no account of the feelings of individuals runs the risk of completely misrepresenting the phenomena under investigation. If artists speak of communicating their feelings to others, or of portraying feelings and their forms in artistic works-If perceivers and critics have their feelings deeply affected and altered through encounters with artistic works-these are situations that merit study and explanation (1973, p. 70). Research on the limbic area of the brain is rela-tively recent (Hart, 1975, p. 66). The factors that determine emotional response to music are complex. Therefore, answers to most questions are highly spec-ulative and are often posed as <b>hypotheses</b> <b>in</b> need of <b>further</b> <b>study...</b>|$|R
