5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (HBP), is a {{long-term}} medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. <b>High</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

40|$|Pain {{sensitivity}} {{is typically}} reduced in individuals with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> although {{the nature of}} this relationship is poorly understood. Relatedly, the ingestion of sweet tasting solutions has been shown to reduce pain, possibly by an opioid mediated mechanism. The objective of the present research was to investigate the effects of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and sweet taste on pain sensitivity in healthy adults. The first aim was to test whether <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> interacts with sweet taste to affect pain sensitivity. The second aim was to test whether endogenous opioids mediate the effects of sweet taste and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> on pain. In Study One, participants held sweet, bitter and plain water solutions in their mouths during exposure to a painful cold pressor test. Replicating previous research, individuals with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> were found to have generally higher pain tolerance than those with lower <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Sweet taste was associated with an increase in pain tolerance but only in individuals with lower range <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> increasing their tolerance to the level of those with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> In Study Two, participants held sweet solution, plain water or nothing in their mouths during cold pressors on two days. To test the involvement of endogenous opioids, participants were administered an opioid antagonist on one of the test days. Participants with <b>higher</b> resting <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> again showed increased tolerance and reduced unpleasantness ratings of the pain tasks, as well as dampened mood reactivity to the testing. In these individuals, the opioid antagonist reduced their pain tolerance and partially reversed their lower mood reactivity. As in Study One, sweet taste increased pain tolerance in participants with lower but not <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> but this was unaffected by opioid blockade. Taken together these results suggest some overlap between non-opioid mechanisms of sweet taste and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> related analgesia. These results are also consistent with work suggesting that endogenous opioid activity {{may play a role in}} the reduced pain sensitivity, and perhaps mood reactivity, of individuals with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and that multiple processes are involved in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia...|$|R

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (<b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure)</b> may occur. Protein loss and <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{albuminuria}} {{are found}} in offspring of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Whether or not kidney development is affected by maternal smoking is unknown. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to twice-daily cigarette-smoke and nicotine condensate (1 mg/kg) or vehicle at day 10 of pregnancy until delivery. Results: Exposed offspring {{did not differ from}} control offspring with respect to body weight, kidney weight, albuminuria, and creatinine clearance. Both male and female offspring had <b>higher</b> tail-plethysmographic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> and lower mean glomerular volume, podocyte, mesangial-cell, and endothelial-cell number, compared to control offspring.

40|$|Elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as a major}} {{indicator}} of higher health risks varies considerably around the globe. We examine whether the livability of the environment can account for part of this variation. Overly resource-poor and overly resource-rich countries {{are expected to be}} less livable, with elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> as a likely result. Male and female populations from 120 countries indeed have <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> to the extent they have to cope with too few or too many rather than just enough environmental resources. In poorer countries, predominantly located in hotter climes, both genders have <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> in too difficult-and-expensive environments with more demanding summers or winters (too few resources), than in just-right environments with more temperate summers and winters (optimal resources). In richer countries, predominantly located in colder climes, both genders have <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> in too easy-and-cheap environments with more temperate winters and summers (too many resources), than in just-right environments with more demanding winters or summers (optimal resources). We conclude that the livability of climate-based demands and wealth-based resources have a heretofore hidden ecological impact on chronic health risks, which may shed novel light also on policies of climate protection and poverty reduction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In a {{new study}} {{controlled}} for many factors, we reconfirmed the relationship of <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to alcohol use. This relationship was slightly stronger in men, whites, and persons 55 {{years of age or}} older. A slight increase in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> appeared in men who drank one to two drinks daily, and a continuous increase occurred at all higher drinking levels among white men who had constant drinking habits. Among women, an increase occurred only at three or more drinks daily. The data suggest complete regression, beginning within days, of alcohol-associated hypertension upon abstinence. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> showed minor differences with beverage preference: those who preferred liquor had <b>higher</b> adjusted mean <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> than those preferring wine or beer. The results of this study contribute to the likelihood that the alcohol-blood pressure association is causal. Smoking, coffee use, and tea use showed no association with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Systolic pressure showed a positive relationship to total serum calcium and an inverse relationship to serum potassium, but diastolic pressure showed little relationship to these blood constituents; the explanations include a possible direct effect on regulation of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year.
