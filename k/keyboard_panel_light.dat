50|$|A {{base unit}} is suited for paper sizes from DIN A3 to DIN A2 and is {{equipped}} with <b>panel</b> <b>lights,</b> a standard camera column and a scanner camera. The use of a controlled rotary indexing table provides new possibilities to improve performance. The rotary indexing table allows a new herbarium specimen to be loaded while another one is scanned. Access is also much easier, as the herbarium specimens are not reloaded directly under the <b>panel</b> <b>lights.</b> Apart from the time needed for scanning and turning the table 180°, the user determines {{the timing of the}} machine (3-12 rpm). The rotary indexing table can be controlled with a standard PC connected through a USB port. The scanner software is also installed on this computer. The rotary indexing table can be accessed from this computer without any problems using Herbar Digital Control software (HDC).|$|R

40|$|The {{basic problem}} of {{communicating}} over a computer network can be illustrated by analogy. Imagine that {{a dozen people}} know they will be imprisoned, one person per cell. Each cell has a single <b>light</b> <b>panel,</b> featuring a <b>light</b> bulb, on/off buttons, and an ID number. <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> with ID # 6 Pressing the "on " button on one <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> turns on the light bulbs in every cell. Likewise, the "off " button turns off everyone's lights. In other words, all <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> are connected to a single light system. 1 Knowing all this, the dozen people conspire to use the light system {{to communicate with each}} other. They know they can represent any information as a string of bits (0 s and 1 s). How can they use their <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> to transmit 0 s and 1 s, and what difficulties will they encounter?

5000|$|... "Follow The Leader" [...] is an eidetic music game {{designed}} {{to test the}} player's memory. Here, a pattern of musical notes are played and four colored <b>panels</b> <b>light</b> up correspondingly. The player then has {{a few seconds to}} repeat the sequence back to the computer. If the sequence is repeated correctly then the computer generates a longer string of notes to perform. As the game progresses, the speeds at which the tune is performed and at which the response by the player must be given are increased. Further enhancing the difficulty of the game, the four colored <b>panels</b> cease to <b>light</b> up in higher levels.|$|R
5000|$|Operating systems {{made for}} {{computers}} with blinkenlights, for example, RSTS/E and RSX-11, would frequently have an idle task blink the <b>panel</b> <b>lights</b> in some recognizable fashion.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{computers were}} mainframes that lacked {{any form of}} operating system. Each user had sole {{use of the machine}} for a scheduled period of time and would arrive at the computer with program and data, often on punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a control panel using dials, toggle switches and <b>panel</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{further reduce}} costs, the {{traditional}} front <b>panel</b> <b>lights</b> showing internal registers were absent. Instead, Librascope mounted a small oscilloscope {{on the front}} panel. It displayed the output from the three register read heads, one above the other, allowing the operator to [...] "see" [...] and actually read the bits. Horizontal and vertical size controls let the operator adjust the display to match a plastic overlay engraved with the bit numbers.To read bits the operator counted the up- and down- transitions of the oscilloscope trace.|$|R

25|$|The lower 15 bits of each {{memory word}} held AGC {{instructions}} or data, with each word being {{protected by a}} 16th odd parity bit.
