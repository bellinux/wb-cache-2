5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and <b>freeze-thaw.</b> Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or <b>freeze-thaw.</b> Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
40|$|Soluble {{material}} {{was obtained from}} sonically freed plasmodiae by three procedures. Two procedures, cryo-impacting and <b>freeze-thawing,</b> were evaluated {{for their ability to}} disrupt the parasites and release soluble material. The soluble materials obtained by these procedures were compared to materials washed from the surfaces of sonically freed parasites. Between 35 and 40 % of the total parasite protein was solubilized by <b>freeze-thawing</b> or cryo-impacting. One cycle of <b>freeze-thawing</b> released nearly as much protein as could be released by this method, and additional cycles of <b>freeze-thawing</b> had little additional effect. Cryo-impacting solubilized only a small amount of protein in addition to that which was released by the cycle of <b>freeze-thawing</b> inherent in the procedure. Reductions in the packed cell volume of the material remaining after <b>freeze-thawing</b> or cryo-impacting indicate that the insoluble fragments are broken into smaller pieces as treatment is extended. Electron microscopy of 30 -s cryo-impacted and three-times <b>freeze-thawed</b> parasites revealed membrane fragments similar in appearance. Patterns obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the soluble material from <b>freeze-thawed</b> and cryo-impacted parasites were also similar, and approximately 13 protein bands were demonstrated. The {{material was}}hed from the surfaces of the free parasites, on the other hand, resolved into only two to four major bands on the gel columns. In immunization studies, the soluble and insoluble fractions obtained by <b>freeze-thawing</b> or cryo-impacting and the material washed from the surfaces of the parasites all stimulated a protective immune response. On the basis of the amount of protein required to stimulate roughly comparable immunity, the soluble fraction obtained by <b>freeze-thawing</b> or cryo-impacting free parasites was about twice as potent an immunogen as was the insoluble fraction. The material obtained by gentle washing of the freed parasites was approximately 20 times as potent an immunogen as were the freed parasites and about 7 times as potent as the soluble material obtained by <b>freeze-thawing</b> or cryo-impacting...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, non-waxy corn starch was {{processed}} by different <b>freeze-thawing</b> temperatures and cycles. The effects of <b>freeze-thawing</b> treatment {{on the surface}} structure, granules particle size, Maltese crosses, crystalline, and thermal properties of non-waxy corn starch were investigated. The number of pores {{on the surface of}} starch granules increased with <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles. The granule size, crystalline intensity and degree, gelatinization temperatures, and enthalpy values of corn starch decreased with <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles increased. The Maltese crosses indicated that loss of Maltese cross increased when <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles increased, but decreased with increase in temperature. Moreover, clear cracks and big pores were observed on the surface of starch granules, and smaller granule size and lower thermal parameters were obtained in the distorted corn granules caused by the changes in crystalline structure under appropriate treatment (− 20 °C freezing and 25 °C thawing, 20 cycles). <b>Freeze-thawing</b> treatment significantly increased the porosity of corn starch, which indicated that it can improve adsorptive capacity of starches. Therefore, <b>freeze-thawing</b> method is potentially very useful to produce porous starch as carrier or absorbent for food and medicine.

5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the <b>freeze-thaw</b> activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of lipid-based transfection reagents have permitted their widespread use in molecular biology and gene therapy. This study outlines {{the effect of}} cryo-manipulation of a cationic lipid-based formulation, Lipofectamine 2000, which, after being frozen and thawed, showed orders of magnitude higher plasmid delivery efficiency throughout eight different cell lines, without compromising cell viability. Increased transfection efficiency with the <b>freeze-thawed</b> reagent was also seen with 2 '-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotide delivery and in a splice-correction assay. Most importantly, a log-scale improvement in gene delivery using the <b>freeze-thawed</b> reagent was seen in vivo. Using three different methods, we detected considerable differences in the polydispersity of the different nucleic acid complexes as well as observed a clear difference in their surface spreading and sedimentation, with the <b>freeze-thawed</b> ones displaying substantially higher rate of dispersion and deposition on the glass surface. This hitherto overlooked elevated potency of the <b>freeze-thawed</b> reagent facilitates the targeting of hard-to-transfect cells, accomplishes higher transfection rates, and decreases the overall amount of reagent needed for delivery. Additionally, as we also saw {{a slight increase in}} plasmid delivery using other <b>freeze-thawed</b> transfection reagents, we postulate that <b>freeze-thawing</b> might prove to be useful for an even wider variety of transfection reagents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{recycling}} of construction waste, recycled concrete has gradually become a viable {{material in the}} construction industry. To study the strength property of the recycled concrete after <b>freeze-thawing</b> experiments, recycled concrete and ordinary concrete were tested for their post-test strength after <b>freeze-thawing</b> for 0, 50, and 100 times. The result shows that {{the strength of the}} recycled concrete declined more quickly than that of normal concrete after <b>freeze-thawing.</b> In the paper, the two kinds of concrete underwent permeability test and the two kinds of aggregate underwent mercury intrusion. After the comparison of the inner structure of the concrete and aggregate was obtained, the influence of concrete pore structure on strength after <b>freeze-thawing</b> was further analyzed. The result of the permeability test shows that the porosity of recycled concrete is large when taken as a whole, and the water content is higher after steeping, which reduces the strength of the material. Mercury intrusion results also show that the pore structure of recycled aggregate is poor and that there are more internal micro-cracks. Therefore, in areas with regular <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles, particularly in humid areas, the use of recycled concrete should be prudently used and handled accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{long-term}} properties of fresh cold-stored osteochondral allograft tissue. We hypothesized fresh cold-stored tissue would yield superior material properties in an in vivo ovine model compared to those using <b>freeze-thawed</b> acellular grafts. In addition, we speculated that a long storage time would yield less successful grafts. We created 10 -mm defects in medial femoral condyles of 20 sheep. Defects were reconstructed with allograft plugs stored at 4 °C for 1, 14, and 42  days; control specimens were <b>freeze-thawed</b> or defect-only. At 52  weeks, animals were euthanized and retrieved grafts were analyzed for cell viability, gross morphology, histologic grade, and biomechanical and biochemical analysis. Explanted cold-stored tissue had superior histologic scores over <b>freeze-thawed</b> and defect-only grafts. Specimens stored for 1 and 42  days had higher equilibrium moduli and proteoglycan content than <b>freeze-thawed</b> specimens. We observed no difference among any of the cold-stored specimens for chondrocyte viability, histology, equilibrium aggregate modulus, proteoglycan content, or hypotonic swelling. Reconstructing cartilage defects with cold-stored allograft resulted in superior histologic and biomechanical properties compared with acellular <b>freeze-thawed</b> specimens; however, storage time {{did not appear to be}} a critical factor in the success of the transplanted allograft...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogels are {{three-dimensional}} polymeric networks {{very similar}} to biological tissues. Many synthetic polymers {{can be used in}} preparing hydrogels. Among them poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), physically crosslinked by repeated <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles of polymer aqueous solutions, is widely employed to make hydrogels for biomedical applications. To increase the similarity between hydrogels and natural tissues and to obtain 'polymeric hybrid tissues', we attempted to incorporate 3 T 3 cells, from a mouse fibroblast cell line, into PVA hydrogels obtained by one <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycle using as a solvent complete culture medium. Hydrogels were also made using eight <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles from PVA solutions prepared using as a solvent either complete culture medium or water. Cell adhesion experiments were performed by seeding 3 T 3 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on to the hydrogel surface. The effect of the solvent and of the different number of <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles on the mechanical characteristics of the PVA hydrogels were investigated by dynamic-mechanical techniques. A scanning force microscope analysis of the hydrogel surface viscoelastic properties was also carried out. Our results show that PVA is not cytotoxic. Although PVA hydrogel surface characteristics do not seem to favour the adhesion of substrate-dependent cells, encouraging results were obtained with the 3 T 3 cells incorporation. DMA analysis indicates that the networks prepared by eight <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycles possess a mechanical consistency comparable, even slightly better, than the ones prepared by only one <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycle and used for the cell incorporation studies. Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks {{very similar to}} biological tissues. To approximate the nature of biological tissues in the best way possible - in the process obtaining polymeric hybrid tissues - 3 T 3 cells from a mouse fibroblast cell line were incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels obtained by one <b>freeze-thawing</b> cycle using a solvent complete culture medium.

In this work, the influence of <b>freeze-thawing</b> environment on a pitting corrosion occurred in the welded austenitic stainless steel in Cl- solutions was investigated using SUS 304 specimen with bead-on-plate welding. The specimen was fully immersed in FeCl 3 solution. The <b>freeze-thawing</b> environment was recreated by a temperature cycling from 20 °C to - 20 °C. As a result, large-scale pitting corrosions was induced mostly in the area of a high tensile residual stress and a sensitive metallographic structure near weld line under the <b>freeze-thawing</b> environment.

Also the water content of the freeze-dried egg albumin, a representative protein, was measured with or without some additives, for the clarification of the mechanism of their protective ability. <b>Freeze-thawing</b> reduced the enzymatic activity of catalase to the extent de-pendent on the final freezing temperature but did not change the conformation, suggesting that the structure of a globular protein is more stable than that of a rod-like protein against <b>freeze-thawing.</b> Freeze-drying unfolded the conformation and dissociated into 3. 8 S or 5. 8 S subunits of a single component independently of freezing conditions of catalase showing that the unfolding and the dissociation was due only to drying. Addi-tives with the protective ability seemed to decrease the residual water content of freeze-dried albumin.
