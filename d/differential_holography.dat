40|$|We propose <b>differential</b> <b>holography</b> as {{a method}} to {{overcome}} the long-standing forward-scattering problem in photoelectron holography and related techniques for the three-dimensional imaging of atoms. Atomic images reconstructed from experimental and theoretical Cu 3 p holograms from Cu(001) demonstrate that this method suppresses strong forward-scattering effects so as to yield more accurate three-dimensional images of side- and back-scattering atoms.

40|$|We {{successfully}} use {{the corners}} of a common silicon nitride supporting window in lensless X-ray microscopy as extended references in <b>differential</b> <b>holography</b> to obtain a real space hologram of the illuminated object. Moreover, we combine this method with the iterative phasing techniques of coherent diffraction imaging to enhance the spatial resolution on the reconstructed object, and overcome the problem of missing areas in the collected data due {{to the presence of}} a beam stop, achieving a resolution close to 85 nm...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Differential</b> Fourier <b>Holography</b> (DFH) {{gives an}} exact {{mathematical}} {{solution of the}} inverse problem of diffraction in the Fraunhofer regime. After the first publication [1] the <b>Differential</b> Fourier <b>Holography</b> was successfully applied in many experiments to obtain amplitude and phase information about two-dimensional (2 D) images. In this article we demonstrate numerically the possibility to apply the DFH also for investigation of unknown 3 D Objects. The first simulation is made for a double-spiral structure plus a line as a reference object...|$|R
40|$|Holography is a lensless imaging {{technique}} {{which can be}} applied to measure static or dynamic displacements of structures. Conventional holography cannot be readily applied to measure vibration modes of high-temperature structures, due to difficulties caused by thermal convection currents. The present report discusses the use of pulsed <b>differential</b> <b>holography,</b> which is a technique for recording structural motions in the presence of random fluctuations such as turbulence. An analysis of the differential method is presented, and demonstration experiments were conducted using heated stainless steel plates. Vibration modes were successfully recorded for the heated plates at temperatures of 1000, 1600, and 2000 F. The technique appears promising for such future measurments as vibrations of the space shuttle TPS panels or recording flutter of aeroelastic models in a wind-tunnel...|$|E
