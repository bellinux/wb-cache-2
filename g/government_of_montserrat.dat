5|$|Voight's {{successful}} {{prediction that}} an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank {{rather than its}} summit, {{attracted the attention of}} the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montserrat</b> in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites. Following these eruptions, Voight served {{as a member of the}} Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the University of Bristol, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufrière Hills by using seismic waves and explosions in the ocean. Among other findings, this effort detected a major fault trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|These {{measures}} include {{legal provisions}} for the automatic grant of 6 months stay under {{the freedom of}} movement obligations and honouring CARICOM skills certificates in Montserrat (the latter measure the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montserrat</b> had been implemented by way of amendments to existing Statutory Rules and Orders since 1996 in keeping with conformity with the original Conference of Heads of Government decision on the free movement of university graduates). Montserrat also issues land holding licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure in seeking to comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery. Montserrat's compliance with the movement of capital obligations under the CSME is already assured {{within the framework of the}} East Caribbean Currency Union.|$|E

5000|$|Montserrat is {{also home}} to the {{critically}} endangered Giant Ditch Frog (Leptodactylus fallax), known locally as the Mountain Chicken, found only in Montserrat and Dominica. The species has undergone catastrophic declines due to the amphibian disease Chytridiomycosis and the volcanic eruption in 1997. Experts from Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust have been working with the <b>Montserrat</b> Department <b>of</b> Environment to conserve the frog in-situ in a project called [...] "Saving the Mountain Chicken", and an ex-situ captive breeding population has been set up in partnership with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Zoological Society of London, North of England Zoological Society, Parken Zoo and the <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montserrat</b> and Dominica. Releases from this programme have already taken place in a hope to increase the numbers of the frog and reduce extinction risk from Chytridiomycosis.|$|R
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> Saint Martin first issued {{a tropical storm}} warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> Antigua, <b>Montserrat,</b> Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|R
