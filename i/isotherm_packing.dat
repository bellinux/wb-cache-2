30|$|In addition, {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} on the adsorption behavior of heavy metal on Jordanian natural Zeolitic Tuff (Al Dwairi 2009; Baker et al. 2009). However, there has been no attempt to correlate them with equilibrium and kinetic information for prediction of breakthrough. In this work, our aim is to measure the nickel <b>isotherms</b> in a <b>packed</b> bed of Jordanian Zeolitic Tuff. By fitting the experimental data to model of breakthrough curve, the effective diffusivity of nickel was estimated. Another sub goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of using different grain size and bed length of Zeolitic Tuff on the adsorption capacity and the behavior of the experimental and numerical breakthrough curves and their matching percentage.|$|R
40|$|Graduation Date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 16, 2014 - Dec. 16, 2015 Spray drying has been widely used in food science for long-term storage of products such as powdered milk, and it has recently been used for preservation of more temperature sensitive products such as human blood plasma and single-cell organisms. However, there are no previous reports of successful spray drying of viable mammalian cells. This study lays the groundwork for spray drying of red blood cells (RBCs), with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating a blood transfusion product that is stable at room temperature. To identify promising operating conditions for RBC spray drying, experiments were performed to measure the moisture sorption characteristics of RBCs, as well as their sensitivity to thermal damage. The moisture sorption <b>isotherm</b> of <b>packed</b> RBCs was measured by equilibrating the sample in various relative humidity environments and measuring the residual moisture content. The resulting data was sigmoidal in shape, in agreement with the best-fit Guggenheim–Anderson–de Boer (GAB) model. RBC sensitivity to thermal damage was determined by measuring hemolysis and cell recovery after exposure to temperatures between 37 °C and 80 °C for 25 s. There was no apparent damage for temperatures up to 60 °C, but exposure to temperatures of 70 °C or higher caused complete cell lysis. Together, the results of these experimentsallowed the use of a mathematical model of the spray drying process to identify promising operating conditions. Based on these model predictions, preliminary RBC spray drying experiments w ere performed using a custom system consisting of a two-fluid atomizer, a drying chamber and a biosafety enclosure with a HEPA filter. The results demonstrate the potential for creation of an RBC powder that is sufficiently dry for long term storage. However, few intact RBCs were observed after rehydration. To improve RBC viability, we suggest that the spray drying system should be modified to enable a secondary gas input and better insulation of the drying chamber...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} project, adsorption is {{considered for the}} separation of CO 2 from CO for applications such as industrial syngas production and in particular to improve {{the conversion of the}} Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process. The use of adsorption technology for these applications requires an adsorbent that can effectively separate out CO 2 from a gas mixture containing CO 2, CO, and H 2. However, adsorption of H 2 is insignificant when compared to both CO 2 and CO, with only CO 2 and CO being the adsorbed species. The adsorption of CO 2 and CO was investigated in this work for four major types of industrial adsorbents which include: activated aluminas, activated carbons, silica gels, and zeolites. Zeolites, with their ability to be fine tuned many parameters which may affect adsorption, were investigated in terms of the effect of the cations present, SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios, and structure to determine how to optimize adsorption of CO 2 while decreasing adsorption of CO. This will help to determine a promising adsorbent for this separation with focus on maximizing the selective adsorption of CO 2 over CO. To investigate this separation three scientific experimental methods were used; gravimetric adsorption isotherm analysis, volumetric adsorption <b>isotherm</b> analysis, and <b>packed</b> bed adsorption desorption breakthrough analysis. Gravimetric and volumetric methods allow for testing the adsorbent with the individual species of CO 2 and CO. This investigation will let us determine the pure component adsorption capacity, heats of adsorption, regenerability, and basic selectivity. Packed bed adsorption breakthrough experimentation was then carried out on promising adsorbents for the CO 2 separation from a mixture of CO 2, CO, and H 2. These experiments used a gas mixture that would be comparable to that produced from the RWGS reaction to determine the multicomponent gas mixture behaviour for adsorption. Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) with a purge gas stream of H 2 was then used to regenerate the adsorbent...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth in}} the importance of oil and gas production and processing overall the globe increase the need for accurate prediction of various parameters and their impact on unit operations, process simulation and design. Because of the particular nature of various parameters, sometimes existing methods encounter difficulties. Currently several models are available to predict various design parameters in the oil and gas processing industries. However, their calculations may require rigorous computer solutions. Therefore, developing the new predictive tools to which are easier than the existing methods, less complicated with fewer computations to minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps is an essential need. It is apparent that mathematically compact, simple, and reasonably accurate predictive tools, as proposed in this thesis, would be preferable for computationally intensive simulations. In fact, the development of engineering correlations by a modification to the well-known Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) [1921 - 1926] equation and Arrhenius equation (1889) was the primary motivation of the present thesis, which, nevertheless, yielded predictive tools with accuracy comparable to that of the existing rigorous simulations. Hence, some existing approaches lead to complicated equations for the purposes of engineering importance. This problem has been circumvented conveniently by resorting to simpler approaches, as described in this thesis. The purpose of the proposed Dissertation work is to develop and formulate accurate and reliable predictive tools to serve two purposes. First, being conversion of a set of highly correlated variables to a set of independent variables by using linear transformations. Second one is for variable reductions. When a dependent variable is specified, the method is very efficient for dimensional reduction due to the supervised nature of its methodology. The developed tools in this study can be immense engineering value to predict different process design parameters, including the prediction of hydrate forming conditions of natural gases, hydrate forming pressure of pure alkanes in the presence of inhibitors, water-hydrocarbon systems mutual solubilities, water content of natural gas, density, thermal conductivity and viscosity of aqueous glycol solutions, optimum size of inlet scrubber and contactor in natural gas dehydration systems, estimation of water-adsorption isotherms, estimation of equilibrium water dew point of natural gas in triethylene glycol dehydration systems, true vapour pressure (TVP) of LPG and natural gasoline, hydrocarbon components solubilities in hydrate inhibitors, methanol vaporization loss and solubility in hydrocarbon liquid phase for gas hydrate inhibition, storage pressure of gasoline in uninsulated tanks, emissivity of combustion gases, filling losses from storage containers,bulk modulus and volumetric expansion coefficient of water for leak tightness test of pipelines, silica solubility and carry-over in steam, carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption <b>isotherms,</b> estimation of <b>packed</b> column size, estimation of thermal insulation thickness, transport properties of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, estimation of economic thermal insulation thickness, water content of air at elevated pressures, surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons, aqueous solubility and density of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, thermal conductivity of hydrocarbons, downcomer design velocity and vapour capacity correction factor in fractionators, estimation of convection heat transfer coefficients and efficiencies for finned tubular sections, estimation of heat losses from process piping and equipment surfaces, prediction of absorption/stripping factors, correlating theoretical stages and operating reflux in fractionators, design of radiant and convective sections of direct fired heaters and many other engineering parameters. Following the development of predictive tools, experimental work was undertaken to measure the density and viscosity, of ethylene glycol + water, diethylene glycol + water, and triethylene glycol + water mixtures at temperatures ranging from 290 K to 440 K and concentrations ranging from 20 mol % glycol to 100 mol % glycol. Our data were correlated using a novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and a thermodynamical method (the generalized corresponding states principle (GCSP)). Both novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and GCSP method, with two adjustable parameters for each property, offer the potential for judicious extrapolation of density and viscosity data for all glycol + water mixtures. In addition, in this thesis, the PreTOG software package has been developed, which covers a wide range of parameters in oil, gas and chemical processing industries and is using PC-based Windows and Matlab graphical user interfaces and tool boxes. The PreTOG software is also available on an stand-alone CD. Finally the following typical case studies for potential benefits to various processing plants industries will be presented and the results of new proposed model are compared with partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) : •Methanol vaporization loss during gas hydrate inhibition •Methanol loss in condensate liquid phase during gas hydrate inhibition •Estimation of potential savings from reducing unburned combustible losses in coal-fired systems •Recoverable heat from blowdown systems during steam generation •Energy conservation benefits in excess air controlled gas-fired systems •Prediction of salinity of salty crude oi...|$|R
