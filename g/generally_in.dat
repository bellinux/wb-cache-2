In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E

Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.|$|E
