5|$|Three of the skulls {{displayed}} {{evidence that}} they had experienced violence; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on the left <b>frontal</b> bone, an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left <b>frontal,</b> and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on the right <b>frontal.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the <b>frontal</b> in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the <b>frontal</b> between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the <b>frontal</b> and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and <b>frontal</b> bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the <b>frontal</b> and the squamosal is continuous with that between the <b>frontal</b> and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
50|$|Metopocetus is diagnosable by lateral {{occipital}} crests continuous with temporal crests that diverge forward, {{as well as}} elongate <b>frontals,</b> {{and short}} nasal bones that project posterior to <b>frontals.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this survey}} article we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} <b>frontals,</b> which provides a class of generalised submanifolds with singularities but with well-defined tangent spaces. We present a review of basic theory and known studies on <b>frontals</b> in several geometric problems from singularity theory viewpoints. In particular, in this paper, we try to give some of detailed proofs and related ideas, which were omitted in the original papers, to the basic and important results related to <b>frontals.</b> Comment: 0 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Tapinocephalus atherstonei {{is known}} {{from a number}} of skulls and postcranial bones. The skull is large with a heavily pachyostotic skull roof, a massive bony <b>frontals</b> and a short weak Moschops-like snout. Taurops is a synonym. Phocosaurus megischion [...] is another synonym differing only in that the {{transition}} from the <b>frontals</b> to the snout is not abrupt.|$|R
5|$|Stela 2 is {{believed}} to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the <b>frontal</b> view of a masked figure {{and is the only}} monument at Seibal to show a <b>frontal</b> portrayal. It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show <b>frontal</b> systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An L, {{on the other}} hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for <b>frontal</b> zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the <b>frontal</b> type and location.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua on October 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on October 10. Subsequent to crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on October 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary <b>frontal</b> boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the <b>frontal</b> boundary on October 14.|$|E

50|$|Classified as a tyrannosaurine, Nanuqsaurus is {{diagnosed}} by: a thin, rostrally forked, median {{spur of the}} fused parietals on the dorsal skull roof that overlaps and separates the <b>frontals</b> within the sagittal crest, <b>frontals</b> with a long, rostrally pointed process separating the prefrontal and lacrimal facets and that the first two dentary teeth are {{much smaller than the}} dentary teeth behind them.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} osteological {{characters}} of Taverneichthys bikanericus from the continental Paleocene of India are studied, allowing specifying its systematic {{position within the}} Osteoglossidae. It is shown that {{on the basis of}} its peculiar snout morphology this species occupies an intermediate position between genera such as Chanopsis and Phareodus, which possess a primitive snout with a large dermethmoid reaching the <b>frontals</b> and separating the two nasals from each other, and such as Brychaetus, Musperia, Opsithrissops, Osteoglossum and Scleropages, which exhibit an evolved snout. The latter presents nasals, which are articulated to the <b>frontals,</b> meeting each other on the mid-line, except at their anterior edge, where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from the <b>frontals,</b> is inserted between...|$|R
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce <b>frontal</b> snowsquallsâ€”an intense <b>frontal</b> {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. <b>Frontal</b> squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold <b>frontal</b> passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area previously associated with a <b>frontal</b> system developed into a tropical depression near Bermuda on September22. The depression had sustained winds of 30mph (45km/h) and failed to strengthen further. It became extratropical on September23.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical low {{combined}} with a <b>frontal</b> system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.|$|E
50|$|Arbour {{noted in}} 2014 that the foot in fact had three toes. She {{established}} a single autapomorphy: on the <b>frontals,</b> {{at the middle}} skull roof, a raised V- shaped region is present. Also she determined that Talarurus differed from all known ankylosaurids {{with the exception of}} the American Nodocephalosaurus in the possession of caputegulae, head armour tiles, on the <b>frontals</b> and nasals, that are cone-shaped with a circular base.|$|R
50|$|The genus shows extreme {{reduction}} of hind limbs and absence of fore limbs. Also prefrontals, <b>frontals,</b> supraoculars, and frontoparietals are absent.|$|R
40|$|Three partial skulls of odontocetes {{from the}} Miocene of Antwerp and Kessel, {{northern}} Belgium (southern North Sea Basin) are described {{here as a}} new genus and species of beaked whale (Ziphiidae), Archaeoziphius microglenoideus. This small new whale {{is one of the}} most archaic beaked whales, because of its low vertex, thin and laterally directed premaxillary crests, low contact between the supraoccipital and the <b>frontals</b> on the vertex, and its free atlas. It is also characterized by the strong transverse compression of the <b>frontals</b> on the vertex and a reduced glenoid surface on the squamosal; the two last characters might be considered as derived. Nasals wider than the <b>frontals</b> on the vertex might group A. microglenoideus with the extant larger genera Berardius and Tasmacetus; the nodular <b>frontals</b> and the premaxillary crests are more similar to the condition in Berardius. A sediment sample from the cetacean-bearing strata at Kessel is dated with dinoflagellate cysts as middle Miocene, tentatively late Langhian to early Serravallian, i. e., from ca. 15 Ma to ca. 13. 2 Ma. Archaeoziphius microglenoideus is therefore the oldest reported beaked whale known by cranial material...|$|R

5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal animal {{with a pair of}} horns on the <b>frontal</b> bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a <b>frontal</b> trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level {{disturbance}} moved over the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the <b>frontal</b> wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275miles (440km) northeast of Bermuda.|$|E

40|$|The author {{describes}} the snout osteology of the fossil Osteoglossidae Phareodus and Brychaetus. He {{shows that the}} two genera considerably differ in their naso-ethmoid region. Indeed, Phareodus encaustus and P. queenslandicus possess a large dermethmoid contacting the <b>frontals</b> and separating the two nasals from each other, which is the primitive condition within teleosts. P. testis {{is a little more}} specialized. Its dermethmoid still separates partially the two nasals but it begins to lose its contact with the <b>frontals.</b> On the contrary, Brychaetus muelleri exhibits a specialized snout pattern. The two nasals, articulated with the <b>frontals,</b> are joined together on almost their entire length, except at their anterior edge where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from the <b>frontals,</b> is inserted between them, as in Osteoglossum and Scleropages. Thus, Brychaetus is a valid genus and not a synonym of Phareodus. The author also shows that the osteoglossid Musperia radiata, from the Eocene of Indonesia, displays the same advanced snout pattern as Brychaetus and the two Recent Osteoglossidae. The caudal skeleton of Musperia is described for the first time. The first preural and the first ural centra bear complete neural spines. The five hypurals are autogenous. There is a pair of uroneurals and no epural...|$|R

5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the <b>frontal</b> horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the <b>frontal</b> horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop {{as they move}} up and along a <b>frontal</b> boundary, eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near <b>frontal</b> boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is a}} good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, Jeanne {{weakened}} to a Category 1 hurricane. It {{entered the}} western Gulf of Mexico, and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east. Later, Jeanne diminished to a 65mph (105km/h) tropical storm. A developing trough remained west of Jeanne, and the cyclone was {{embedded in a}} weak pressure gradient. Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70mph (110km/h), an advancing <b>frontal</b> boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14. It executed a clockwise loop, and it merged with the <b>frontal</b> boundary on November 16.|$|E
