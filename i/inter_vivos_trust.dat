25|$|Protector: A {{protector}} may {{be appointed}} in an express, <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trust,</b> {{as a person}} who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another. The legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate. No-one doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities. If a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities, then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees. However, a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one. Also, protectors are comparatively new, while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years. It is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties, and by others that they do not. The case law has not yet established this point.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trust</b> are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E

50|$|In March 1947, Central Hanover {{petitioned the}} New York Surrogate's Court for a {{settlement}} of its first account as common trustee.

50|$|For a {{testamentary}} trust, as {{the settlor}} is deceased, {{he or she}} will generally not have any influence over the trustee's exercise of discretion, although in some jurisdictions it is common for the testator to leave a letter of wishes for the trustee. In practical terms testamentary trusts tend to be driven more by the needs of the beneficiaries (particularly infant beneficiaries) than by tax considerations, which are the usual considerations in <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trusts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When titling {{property}} or otherwise referring to an existing trust, practitioners persist in referring to trusts as [...] "Tr. u/a" [...] (trusts under agreement, i.e., <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trusts)</b> or [...] "Tr. u/w" [...] (trusts under will, i.e., testamentary trusts). Industry convention {{is for the}} settlor's name {{to appear in the}} title. In the USA, the name follows a shorthand for the type of instrument. Hence: [...] "Tr. u/a John Smith FBO Alma Smith" [...] or, if appropriate, [...] "Tr. u/a John Smith FBO Alma Smith irrevocable" [...] (FBO means for benefit of). Titles also frequently include more information such as the existence of more than one trustee ("Co-tr. u/a John Smith": [...] "co-tr" [...] means co-trustee) or that {{one or more of the}} trustees are not the original trustee (Successor Co-Tr. u/a John Smith).|$|R
50|$|A trust {{instrument}} (also {{sometimes called}} a deed of trust, where executed {{by way of}} deed) is an instrument in writing executed by a settlor used to constitute a trust.

50|$|A trust may {{be created}} by will or by an act <b>inter</b> <b>vivos.</b> A {{testamentary}} <b>trust</b> is constituted when a testator bequeaths property to one person, called a “trustee” or an “administrator,” with an instruction to administer it {{for the benefit of}} another person or other persons appointed by the will, or for an impersonal object or purpose (the so-called charitable trust).|$|R

40|$|Basia Piasecka, a thirty-year-old Polish emigre, {{landed in}} New York in 1968 seeking work. Through Polish connections, {{she found her}} way to kitchen {{employment}} in the New Jersey home of Seward Johnson and his second wife, Essie. Within months, Basia became Seward 2 ̆ 7 s mistress. Seward, then seventythree, was an heir to the Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson pharmaceuticals fortune. Although Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson treated Seward as a nominal officer, he played {{no role in the}} company. He spent his decades philandering and dabbling in oceanography through a foundation that he established. In 1971 Seward divorced Essie, settling 20 million on her to dissolve their thirty-two-year marriage. Weeks later Seward married Basia, who was more than forty years his junior. Their marriage endured a dozen years, until Seward died from cancer in May 1983. Seward 2 ̆ 7 s estate was valued at his death in excess of 400 million. Seward was survived by his six adult children, four of whom were older than Basia. Seward had shown little interest in the children when they were young, and his relationship with them as adults was largely perfunctory, although Basia cultivated amicable relations with the children throughout her marriage to Seward. As adults, the children were embarrassing wastrels, constantly in debt to their trust funds. They fared as badly in their marriages and family lives as in their careers and business affairs. The extravagant marital and extramarital adventures of one of Seward 2 ̆ 7 s daughters, Mary Lea, would strain credulity in a work of cheap fiction. Beginning in the 19402 ̆ 7 s, Seward had used <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trusts</b> to settle Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson stock worth tens of millions on each child. In the many wills that he executed across the next four decades, he excluded his children from benefitting further in his estate. After marrying Basia, Seward revised his estate plan several times, making ever larger provision for her. His last will, executed in April 1983 when his struggle with cancer was near the end, devised a little of his estate to his foundation and the rest to Basia. The will excluded the children, as well as their spouses and descendants...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The South African {{population}} {{consists of}} various {{cultural and religious}} groups. Some of the religious minority groups, for example the Hindu's, have their own non-governmental law systems whereby they live daily in the private sphere. South African law does not recognise these religious law systems. The legal position is that marriages conducted according to these religious law systems are invalid. The Durban High Court, earlier this year, held in Singh v Ramparsad that parties married under religious law systems cannot obtain a divorce under South African law. The fact that South African law does not recognise religious marriages poses serious disadvantages to the Hindu wife. A Hindu wife, for example, cannot force her "husband" to support her or to buy household necessities during the existence of their "marriage". The Hindu wife cannot divorce her husband and is therefore further disadvantaged, since she cannot share {{in the growth of}} his estate. In such a case the court will also not grant a support and maintenance order in her favour. Due {{to the fact that the}} Hindu wife is not recognised as a "spouse" by various legislation she will be further disadvantaged as she cannot inherit from her husband's estate should he come to die. Legislation recognising the Hindu wife as a "spouse" does exist. This legislation makes certain estate planning instruments available to the Hindu wife. However, there are a few instances where the Hindu wife will be disadvantaged due to the fact that she is recognised as a "spouse". <b>Inter</b> <b>vivos</b> and mortis causa estate planning instruments are implemented to prevent any shortfalls in the Hindu wife's estate. <b>Inter</b> <b>vivos</b> estate planning instruments, like investments, insurance, <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trusts,</b> agreements, universal partnerships, agencies and enrichment actions can also be implemented. Tax planning is also necessary. The estate planner, while doing the estate planning for the Hindu wife, must also give attention to mortis causa estate planning instruments to ensure that her assets will dissolve on her beneficiaries in the most effective way and according to her wishes. It is very important that the Hindu wife give careful consideration to the provisions of her will. The will can also be combined and implemented with other estate planning instruments, like for example the mortis causa trust. The Hindu wife can take out life insurance in case that there is going to be a shortfall of cash in her estate or if she wants to bequeath legates to specific persons. The Hindu wife can make use of different estate planning structures in her estate plan if she makes use of usufruct. Massing of estates is not recommended, except where the Hindu couple are co-owners of non-dividable assets. Due to the benefits that the estate planning instruments, like trusts, offer, iideicommissums are not recommended. The fact that the Hindu wife is recognised as a "spouse" plays an important role in tax planning. The estate planner will have to pay attention to the estate duty- and capital gains tax benefits due to the fact that Hindu wife will be regarded as a "spouse". It is important that the planning of the estate does not take place in isolation and that all the above-mentioned estate planning instruments be regarded as a whole. The estate plan must be updated and revised once a year. The estate planner must keep in mind that each person is unique. It is impossible to prescribe a set recipe for estate planning. The estate planner will have to take the background and circumstances of the Hindu wife into consideration when planning her estate. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of Kwazulu-Natal, 2004. The {{purpose of}} this {{technical}} report is not to establish a definitive answer as to the validity and suitability of a business trust as {{a new form of}} a business entity, but is aimed at addressing the uncertainties that have emanated from the use of a traditional trust structure as a business vehicle. A critical analysis of the recommendations made by the Margo Commission that the taxation treatment of business trusts and companies should be aligned {{in order to avoid the}} tax abuse of business trusts will also be undertaken. Globally <b>trusts,</b> especially discretionary <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>trusts,</b> are formed purely for carrying on a business including owning and letting of property. However, there are divergent views whether a trust can be used for commercial purposes. Honore (1985 : Preface) is of the opinion that "The use of trusts for business purposes - no new phenomenon, since testators long since saw the advantage of setting up a trust to carry on their enterprises after their death - raises complex issues of control. It should not be assumed without thorough investigation of the past record and future possibilities of business trusts that there is no room for a tertium quid between the commercial partnership and the incorporated company". Wunsh (1986 : 561 - 82) says that a business trust provides a method of setting up or continuing a business alternative to an incorporated company or close corporation (Honore, 1992 : 74). In general a business trust is a pure trust the main object of which is to carry on a business enterprise with a view to making a profit and distributing it amongst the beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that the Trust Property Control Act which controls all forms of trusts was enacted in 1988, Honore (1992 : Preface) is of the view that business trusts call for some further regulation, but not for the full panoply detailed in the Companies Act or even the Close Corporations Act. The analysis of the recommendation of the Margo Commission to align the taxation treatment of business trusts and companies shows that business trusts are not close substitutes for companies as they are 'pure trusts' formed purely for protecting the founder's business for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Although there may be similarities, there are also dissimilarities between business trusts and companies. Further, there are no compelling reasons for changing the current tax regime since taxing business trusts like companies will not necessarily improve equity or efficiency and particularly prevent perceived tax abuse. Tax abuse should be addressed at its source through better enforcement action to limit tax abuse opportunities. In conclusion it will be shown that although a business trust can at present provide certain tax advantages while still preserving the limited liability of the trustees, legislation is gradually being introduced which will iii result in trading trusts being taxed on the same basis as companies. However, the researcher submits that the legislature will not be solving the problem by aligning the tax treatment of business trusts and companies...|$|R
