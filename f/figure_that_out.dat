25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America, not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up. It wasn't just that the critics didn't like the picture; they were angry at me for making it,' Carradine said.

Replying to Brundle's notion that driving {{the way he did}} earlier in the season would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you very much for that piece of advice, I could <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you are going to go. But once you <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E
