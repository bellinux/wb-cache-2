The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is {{having an affair with}} a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at MTV and it also received heavy rotation on Total Request Live. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the Breakaway World Tour (2005) and the All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> Tour (2009).|$|E

25|$|Clarkson's fourth album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> was {{released}} on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, {{but this time she}} returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and staying there for two weeks. The album has sold 960,000 copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham and was shot in Los Angeles in December 2008. It is available for digital download on iTunes and is featured on the DVD of the Deluxe Edition of All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted.</b> A preview of the video was shown during a commercial break for American Idol on January 28, 2009. The full video then premiered via AT's website directly after the broadcast. The video was subsequently nominated for a 2009 MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Female Video.|$|E
25|$|Clarkson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for the album in November 2009 while touring and finished recording in February 2011. Despite its original intent {{to be released in}} late 2010, the release date of the album was pushed back several times. The record is predominantly a pop rock album, with several music critics noting the predominant R and country influences Clarkson explored in Thankful (2003) and All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> as well as dance-pop themes which she had recently developed. The album's lyrical content mainly explores themes about heartbreak, vengeance, forgiveness and empowerment through metaphors about Clarkson's relationships around people.|$|E

25|$|Stronger is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on October 21, 2011 by RCA Records. The thirteen-song track-list features Clarkson collaborating with various new producers {{as well as with}} Howard Benson, whom she collaborated with on her previous album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> (2009). Wanting to stray away sonically from her previous albums, Clarkson's main objective was to record her vocal performances as it is heard in her live sets, and used as little auto-tune processing as possible. The album also marked the first release by Clarkson that did not cause a conflict with RCA; her previous records, most notably My December (2007), were released amidst conflict and controversy.|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{dissatisfaction with}} the song's release as a single, Clarkson began {{promoting}} it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She [...] included [...] "Already Gone" [...] in the encore set of her 2009 All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is {{regarded as one of}} the highlights of All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted.</b> Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic {{lead singer}} Ryan Tedder. Tedder {{describes}} it as [...] "an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song." [...] Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> and [...] "Already Gone" [...] {{is one of three}} of those that appear on the track list.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{heard your}} name. I've heard your name, and I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> {{to hear it}} again. But they say as you've been kind to that girl as 'd 'a been on the town only for that.' ...|$|R

500|$|Soon after {{composing}} [...] "Halo", Tedder {{worked with}} Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> (2009), {{for which they}} wrote [...] "Already Gone" [...] together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being included on All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> but the decision was out of her hands, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce came out. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American pop singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson from her fourth studio album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted.</b> It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, [...] "Already Gone" [...] is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|Before teaming with Clarkson {{to write}} [...] "Already Gone", Ryan Tedder had co-written Beyoncé's song [...] "Halo" [...] for her album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Clarkson later heard [...] "Halo" [...] and noticed {{distinct}} {{similarities between the}} two songs, most notably in the melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps in their backing tracks. She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement, claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles. Clarkson tried to have the song removed from All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> {{but it was too}} late to make any changes; the album was already being pressed and it was not possible to make any changes to the track listing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you understand," [...] she {{interrupted}} impatiently, [...] "that it is {{just this}} very moment, this instant, that I want to get away? Something has gone wrong.

500|$|Clarkson {{released}} her fourth studio album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> in 2009. The album received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2010 and its first three singles, [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You", [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] and [...] "Already Gone", became hits. The release of [...] "Already Gone" [...] {{was met with}} controversy due to its musical similarities with Beyoncé's [...] "Halo" [...] (2009); both were produced and co-written by OneRepublic lead singer Ryan Tedder. Subsequent releases from All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> included [...] "All I Ever Wanted" [...] (2010) and [...] "Cry" [...] (2010), which became less successful than its predecessors. In 2011, Clarkson {{released her}} fifth studio album, Stronger, which was preceded by its lead single [...] "Mr. Know It All". In 2013, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while its second single, [...] "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" [...] (2012), received three nominations, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. [...] "Dark Side" [...] (2012) was released as the album's final single. In 2012, Clarkson recorded three songs for her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One: [...] "Catch My Breath", [...] "Don't Rush" [...] and [...] "People Like Us" [...] (2013), all three of which were released as singles. She released her sixth studio album Wrapped in Red in 2013, a Christmas album containing eleven cover versions of Christmas standards and five original songs, two of which—"Underneath the Tree" [...] and [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] (2014) were issued as singles. Wrapped in Red was succeeded by her seventh studio album Piece by Piece in 2015, which produced the singles [...] "Heartbeat Song", [...] "Invincible" [...] and [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] (2016).|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{received}} universal {{critical acclaim}} and {{is regarded as}} one of the musical and lyrical highlights of All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted.</b> Ryan Brockington from The New York Post called the song a [...] "mixture of old school Stevie Nicks and some Julia Roberts romantic comedy theme song, delivered together in true Clarkson fashion." [...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want to curl up in a blanket and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} and release of [...] "Already Gone" [...] have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2008 Beyoncé Knowles song [...] "Halo", {{and stated that}} the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained {{that he was not}} allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} all <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> {{to hear about}} the past," [...] he said; [...] "and I know what I most wanted to know about the future.

5000|$|Channel Nine {{entertainment}} reporter Richard Wilkins, {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} zero stars, stating [...] "This {{is as close to}} a snuff movie as <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to see… <b>I</b> don't care if it's rooted in truth or not, it's appalling. I've seen it so you don't have to." [...] This review was criticised by culture zine Pedestrian TV and was dismissed by Kurzel and actress Louise Harris.|$|R

500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was {{included}} in the setlist of her Breakaway World Tour (2005). During her concert tour at Germain Arena, Clarkson performed the song wearing the same wedding dress she wore in the song's music video. Clarkson also performed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] on her All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> Tour (2009). While touring at Hammerstein Ballroom, New York City, Clarkson sang the stripped down version of the song, accompanied by guitars and vocal. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone felt that Alanis' influence was evident on the chorus of [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] which was performed acoustically in the event. Clarkson explained that the arrangement was intended to maximize audience sing-along potential in which Jim Cantiello of MTV thought was effective. On December 2011, Clarkson also performed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] on Chicago Theatre as part of the Miracle on State Street benefit concert. Bob Gendron of the Chicago Tribune reviewed Clarkson's performance, writing [...] "the Texas native could've impressed simply by projecting her booming voice and relishing its prodigious range. Yet she seemed determined to reinforce female empowerment themes often missing from her mainstream-pop contemporaries' hits." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Vadim Perelman. Clarkson wrote the treatment for the video herself in order to reflect the pain that she felt due to her parents' divorce. The video's plot centers on Clarkson engaging in a heated argument {{with her husband in}} front of her child before realizing that she was repeating her parents' mistake. It won in the category for Best Female Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. [...] "Because of You" [...] was performed live at numerous venues, including the My December Tour (2007) as well as the All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> Tour (2009). It was covered by several artists including Ronan Parke, who was a runner-up in the fifth series of Britain's Got Talent, and added to the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera Belíssima. In 2007, the song was recorded by Reba McEntire as a duet with Clarkson, which was released as a lead single for McEntire's twenty-fourth studio album [...] [...] "Piece by Piece", the title track from Clarkson's seventh studio album, serves as the canonical sequel to [...] "Because of You".|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was married}} five times: he married actress Sally Gracie (1952–1958), actress Claire Bloom (1959–1969), {{secretary}} Sherry Nelson (1973–1979), singer Paula Ellis (1986–1997) and actress Joan Benedict Steiger (married 2000 until his death). He had a daughter, opera singer Anna Steiger (born in 1960) by Bloom, and a son, Michael Steiger (born in 1993), from {{his marriage to}} Ellis. In an interview with journalist Kenneth Passingham, Steiger stated that Bloom was [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> in a woman", and that [...] "maybe our marriage was better than most because we were both established when we met". The couple bought a home in Malibu, California, a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring. They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in County Galway, {{in close proximity to}} John Huston's home. Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid-1970s. It upset him greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer Hillard Elkins the same year, a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting Waterloo. Steiger was also close friends with actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
