Therefore, nodal method was used to apprehend thermo-aeraulic behavior of air subjected to varied solicitations. A coupling was made between equations proposed by P.

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that Trombe walls must be full height, completely blocking light and <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> into the adjacent living space rather converting it into absorbed radiant heat that is then re-emitted as the room cools.

40|$|The use of {{sunlight}} {{has always been}} a major goal in the design and operation of commercial buildings to minimize electrical consumption of artificial lighting systems. Glazing systems designed to allow optimal visible light transmission also allow significant unwanted <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain</b> caused by infrared light.

40|$|Buildings {{are one of}} the {{important}} energy consuming sectors. The increasing environmental awareness has triggered a great emphasis on sustainable design in the current global building industry. Since the past century, there has been a distinct growing trend in the use of fully glazed facade in office buildings. This paper discussed and analysed how solar control and natural ventilation systems can be integrated into double skin facade systems to minimise the environmental impacts. Sun shading should be considered {{as an integral part of}} fenestration system design that is adapted into the facade design of office buildings. The technology of facade systems that integrate solar control and ventilation systems encompasses a wide range of strategies resulting in energy efficient building design.

40|$|Based on {{a monthly}} {{correlation}} method for houses with <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains,</b> an extension to the method has been developed, based on the ratio between the additional <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> through the TI-walls and the heat load for the house with equivalent opaque insulation. This approach seems to be adapted to the question whether one should choose between the alternatives of opaque and transparent insulation for a fixed house design. Using a single zone simulation program for the TI-building with time-steps of 20 min or less, a simple correlation function could be determined using a nonlinear fitting function. In order to achieve this, monthly results from 18 house simulation cases with different TI-wall orientation and TI-wall area have been analysed (1). Results for average monthly heat gains and average room temperatures show good agreement. Up to now neither different types of heating systems nor ohter building types have been analysed. However, the methodology is flexible enough to cope with t hese variations in future. For first approximations of the heat demand of a TI-house, the method can be easily programmed as a spread sheet...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} element in creating daylighting {{is the use of}} clerestory windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare. In the case of a passive solar house, clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office.|$|E
50|$|In the Northern Hemisphere {{in summer}} (June, July, August), the Sun {{rises in the}} northeast, peaks out {{slightly}} south of overhead point (lower in the south at higher latitude), and then sets in the northwest, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere in summer (December, January, February), the Sun rises in the southeast, peaks out slightly north of overhead point (lower in the north at higher latitude), and then sets in the southwest. A simple latitude-dependent equator-side overhang can easily be designed to block 100% of the <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> from entering vertical equator-facing windows on the hottest days of the year.

Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study, which analyzed the proposed 22 Bishopsgate tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration, usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain.</b> Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30 cm), using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15-20% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.|$|E

40|$|The Thermal Test Facility (TTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, was {{designed}} and constructed using a whole-building energy design approach. This approach treats a building as a single unit, not as a shell containing many separate systems. It relies {{on the use of}} energy simulation tools for optimization throughout the design process, and requires the involvement and commitment of the architect, engineer, and owner. It can produce a building that requires substantially less energy than a building designed and constructed with conventional means. TTF operating costs are 63 % less than those of a code-compliant basecase building. These savings were achieved by implementing an approach that optimized passive solar technologies and integrated energy-efficient building systems. Passive solar technologies include daylighting, high-efficiency lighting systems, engineered overhangs, <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> for heating, thermal mass building materials, managed glazing, and a good thermal envelope.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the design of}} active window shades is developed to control the <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> through a window. Using simple actuation hardware and sensors, a control strategy is presented that automatically adjusts window shades to save HVAC energy by controlling direct solar radiation passing through a window. The control algorithm is based on a simple approach that admits direct light in the winter and blocks the direct light in the summer, while providing shade adjustment that affords maximum visibility through the window. Cloudy skies or indirect sun result in horizontal placement of the shades, and the shades close at night. The implementation uses two thin-film photovoltaic cells as sensors and a control algorithm that is independent of the window orientation, latitude, or solar time, so that it operates properly in any installation location. Preliminary analytic and test results show significant energy savings when the automatic window shades are compared with a window without shades, and with a window outfitted with fixed horizontal shades...|$|E

While the entire state of Jordan faces serious shortages in energy sources, significant growth in both industrial investment and constructions is noticed {{in the last few years}} particularly in Amman. This includes construction of both apartment and office buildings using a relatively new construction systems/elements. In Amman, for instance, Double-skin facades (DSF) have recently been introduced to a few buildings. However, there are no noticeable studies showing how it will work under the climate of Amman. Literature from similar climates indicates that while DSF is expected to perform well in winter, summer overheating is a major problem in hot regions due to large glazed surfaces facing excessive <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> that coincide with high ambient temperatures. Thus, it is highly important to investigate the operational performance of this relatively new system in such a climate before it is widely applied due to its advantages as a promising passive technology. This study aims to investigate the thermal performance of DSF integrated into office buildings in Amman. Intended work was conducted using TAS tool and based on Amman’s weather file. Results showed that integration of DSF into multi-storeys office buildings would generally increase indoor operative temperatures for both conditions. While this would lead to significant overheating in summer times, indoor thermal comfort would almost be achieved in winter with a slight possibility of overheating during peak hours.

Therefore, the proper controls of shading devices inside a DSF air cavity can contribute to thermal and acoustical comfort with avoiding overheating and noise transmission. This study aimed at evaluating the correlation between natural ventilation potential and noise transmission loss based on the degree of orientation and thickness of vertical shading devices inside a DSF air cavity.

The CSW is usually combined with fenestration to form a south-facing façade, which has an important effect on the indoor environment. This thesis presents a numerical model to analyze the thermal performance of the CSWs, and simulations based on this model are carried out for the following cases: a traditional heat storage wall with natural convective flow, integrated photovoltaic (PV) CSWs with forced convective flow, a wall with controlled blinds, and several cases with a phase change material (PCM).

The design subject of the case study is a wide span roof, which {{is part of a larger}} ongoing project in Bologna (Italy). The use of renewable resources available on site has been a key aspect of the project. Here we focus on passive reduction of summer overheating and on daylight. For these tasks a parametric model has been developed. Three project scales are being discussed. At the large scale, parametric variations of the overall shape of the roof are investigated in relation to cooling through ventilation; here the parametric model allows for the generation of both different configurations of the roof, including its structural morphology, and variations of its structural tessellation. At the medium scale, the integration of openable modules is investigated in relation to air extraction for cooling; with respect to this, the parametric model allows exploring openings based on variations of size and distribution.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of a central court or atrium within a building is a popular design due to its aesthetic, open appearance. The greater penetration of natural light aids in the reduction in use of artificial lighting during the day. Care {{must be taken to}} balance the <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain</b> against the daylight penetration. This balance is critical for the reduction of the electrical energy load of the building, whilst maintaining a high level of comfort for the occupants. In the tropics modifications to atrium building designs are necessary to diminish high elevation <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain.</b> Traditionally, shading the window apertures or lowering the transmission through the glazing was used. These solutions limit the view and reduce the light level. The use of angular selective glazing upon atria allows the rejection of high elevation direct sunlight whilst redirecting and therefore improving low elevation skylight penetration. Tilted angular selective glazing used upon adjoining spaces to atria help vertical light in the atrium well to be redirected horizontally deep into the space. These effects reduce overheating which would normally restrict the use of atria in warmer environments as well as improve illumination penetration into adjoining spaces. The research showed that under clear sky conditions the modified glazing gave a lower temperature {{in the middle of the}} day within the atrium well. A more even distribution of illuminance across the course of the day was found and a higher level of illuminance was achieved within the well and its adjoining spaces under clear skies. These effects were simulated using computer algorithms. The algorithms were verified by field data collected from the QUT Daylighting Research Test Building located at the Brisbane Airport Bureau of Meteorology site where two simultaneously monitored model (1 : 10 scale) atriums were studied for several months...|$|R

The coupling of a PCM and glass panes could be a way of improving the low thermal inertia of fenestrations and could be an effective way of collecting, storing and exploiting solar energy at a building scale. In the present work, a simple prototype of a PCM glazing system has been proposed and its energy performance has been analysed and compared with a conventional fenestration. The two glazing technologies were installed on an south facing outdoor test cell, in a temperate sub-continental climate. The surface temperatures, transmitted irradiances and heat fluxes of both the PCM glazing and the reference fenestration were measured during an extensive experimental campaign. Summer, Mid-season and Winter days were considered during the analysis, in both sunny and cloudy weather conditions, in order to assess the energy performance of the PCM glazing under different boundary conditions. The experimental results have highlighted a good ability of the PCM glazing to store solar energy and to smooth and delay peak values of the total heat flux. In summer the PCM prototype allows the energy gain to be lowered by more than 50 %, compared to the traditional fenestration. In winter, a suitable reduction in the heat loss during the day can be observed, but the <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> is also drastically reduced and the application of this technology for passive solar heating purpose might not always be effective.

Victorian schools were notabie for tall windows and high ceilings. In the 1980 s several schools in Hampshire and elsewhere attempted to use solar gains for heating, {{with varying degrees of}} success. Exploiting <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> requires not only south-facing glaz-ing but also that room surfaces, especially floors which recelve direct insolation, are of sufficiently high thermal admittance to absorb the solar gains and avoid overheat-ing. These last requirements are not always compatible with soft finishes needed for acoustic reasons. In addition, excessive areas of glazing even when they are south-facing can lead to local cold radiant effects and glare. Glazed streets or atria can pro-vide valuable circulation space if unheated; but heating them to full comfort temperature as teaching space can turn them into an energy penalty. With attached sun-spaces, occupants must take action such as opening the dividing windows or doors to benefit from the solar-heated air when it is available, and the opposite when gains cease so as to avoid reverse flow. Sun-spaces, iike glazed streets, reduce the avail-ability of both natural ventilation and daylight to the rooms to which they are attached. In the 1990 s higher ievels of insulation and double glazing have become the norm. Fabric heat losses have reduced, so ventilation losses have become relatively more signifi-cant. Concern about indoor air quality has focused attention on adequate ventilation rates to dilute internal pollutants. There is also greater awareness of the cost to th...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} number of decisions to be made during early stage design, {{there is a need}} for intuitive methods to communicate data so that it is quickly and easily understood by the designer. In daylighting analysis, research has been moving towards dynamic daylighting metrics, which include both annual performance indicators and local climate conditions. Temporally-based graphics are one method of annual data display which shows great promise for use in the early design stage. Not only can temporal data be easily connected to time-dependent environmental variables like weather and solar angle, but non-spatial quantities related to solar heat gain can be compared on the same terms with spatial quantities like illuminance. This thesis demonstrates methods for quickly calculating annual data sets for which temporal maps are the intended display format. Metrics are then developed in order to display goal-based performance information for an entire area of interest on a single temporal map. This process is demonstrated first by reducing the number of simulations necessary to produce reliable annual illuminance data, the results of which are compiled into a metric based on a user-given illuminance range, known as Acceptable Illuminance Extent (AIE). Similarly, a geometry-based glare approximation method is developed and validated for quick annual calculations of Daylight Glare Probability, and the results are condensed to a single number representative of glare perception within the model, known as Glare Avoidance Extent (GAE). (cont.) Finally, a simple solar heat gain indicator is demonstrated using the Balance Point calculation method and the metric Solar Heat Scarcity/Surplus (SHS) is used to convey the urgency of allowing more <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> or shading it. This thesis is part of the Lightsolve project, which aims to specifically address the needs of the architect during early design stages. Specifically, Lightsolve aims to produce fast, unique design analyses, based on local annual climate data with reasonably accurate and intuitive outputs to promote good decision-making.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the influence of}} thermal mass on the space conditioning energy consumption and indoor comfort conditions of multi-storey buildings with concrete, steel and timber structural systems. The buildings studied were medium sized educational and commercial buildings. When calculating a building’s life-cycle energy consumption, the construction materials have a direct effect on not only the building’s embodied energy {{but also on the}} space conditioning energy. The latter depends, amongst other things, on the thermal characteristics of the building’s materials; thermal mass can also be an influence on comfort conditions in the building. A modelling comparison has been undertaken between three very similar medium-sized buildings, each designed using structural systems made primarily of timber, concrete and steel. The post-tensioned timber version of the building is a modelled representation of a real three-storey educational building that has been constructed recently in Nelson, New Zealand. The concrete- and steel-structured versions have been designed on paper to conform to the required structural codes and meet, as closely as possible, the same performance, internal space layout and external façade features as the real timber-structured building. Each of these three structurally-different buildings has been modelled with two different thermal envelopes (code-compliant and New Zealand best-practice) using a heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system with heating only (educational scheme) and heating and cooling (commercial scheme). The commercial system (with cooling) was applied only to the buildings with the best-practice thermal envelope. The analysis of each of these nine different construction and usage categories includes the modelling of operational energy use with an emphasis on HVAC energy consumption, and the assessment of indoor comfort conditions using predicted mean vote (PMV). From an operational energy use perspective, the modelling comparison between the different cases has shown that, within each category (code-compliant, low-energy and low-energy-commercial), the principal structural material has only a small effect on overall performance. The most significant differences are in the building with the best-practice thermal envelope with the commercial HVAC system, were the concrete building has slightly lower HVAC energy consumption, being 3 and 4 % lower than in the steel and timber buildings respectively The assessment of indoor comfort conditions during occupied periods through using PMV {{for each of the three}} categories shows that the timber structure consistently exhibited longer periods in the over-warm comfort zone, but this was much less pronounced in south-facing spaces. To examine the reasons for the less acceptable PMV in the timber-structure versions, an analysis of indoor timber and concrete surface temperatures was carried out in both buildings. It was found that, particularly in north-facing spaces, there were large diurnal swings in the temperatures of timber surfaces exposed to solar radiation. These swings were much less in the case of concrete surfaces so the environment was perceived to be more comfortable under such conditions because of the reduced influence of higher mean radiant temperatures. To moderate this potential downside of solar-exposed internal timber surfaces, better results are achieved if, when timber is used for thermal mass, the timber is not exposed to <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> radiation, for example locating it in the ceilings or on the south side of the building. Two other approaches to combating the potential overheating problem in the timber-structured buildings were analysed in an illustrative mode; addition of external louvres to reduce <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> at critical times of day and year; and use of phase change material (PCM) linings to act as light-mass energy buffers. Although external louvres increase comfort conditions significantly by reducing the periods of an overly warm environment, they produce an increase in heating energy consumption through reducing beneficial <b>solar</b> <b>gains.</b> The use of PCM linings shows little benefit to overall indoor comfort conditions for the building of this case-study...|$|R
40|$|Solar shading is an {{important}} element {{not only for the}} purpose of reducing <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain,</b> but also for controlling the quality of daylighting and associated glare. The balance between the prevention of heat gains and natural daylight penetration is crucial for energy saving in building cooling and lighting. However, many buildings nowadays do not show proper use of solar shading. One of the main factors is the lack of understanding and proper use of shading design tools or methods. The main objective of this research is to determine the optimum external solar shading geometry for energy efficiency in hot humid tropic. Besides, this research also accesses the application of computer simulation tools for shading design. Two methodologies were employed in this research. The first one was an assessment on computer simulation tools using scaled physical model measurement. Desktop Radiance 2. 0 and VELUX Daylight Visualizer 2. 5 were selected and evaluated for proper application under tropical sky. The second methodology was building energy simulation using e-QUEST- 3. This experiment was to investigate the impact of room geometry, fenestration size and external overhang depth on building energy consumption. The results showed that the highest energy saving achieved was as much as 70 percents. The relationship of the 3 variables was discussed and prediction tool for optimum shading was developed for energy efficiency. Futhur study can be carried out on other types of shading devices and variables such as room height, overhang angle, colour, etc. The findings can be further developed into simplified shading design tool...|$|R
40|$|To date {{powerful}} dynamic energy simulation {{tools are}} available. These, however, {{require a lot}} of input and the large output has to be filtered to select relevant results for the early design phase. In consequence, early design decisions regarding energy efficiency are in practice often based on the architect’s experience or intuition. In this research a simplified approach is proposed to estimate the heating energy demand, based on the Dynamic Equivalent Degree-day method (DEq°d). Moreover, as most architects think in a graphical way, the results of simulation runs with a whole range of parameters done beforehand are used to visualise via a parallel coordinate representation the effect of different parameters upon energy use. In this representation different parameters can be visualised or not in an interactive graphical way such as the building compactness, insulation level, the effective use of <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>solar</b> <b>gains,</b> internal gains (including occupancy schedule and activities), and global ventilation strategies. As the approach consists of a speedy analysis, based on a limited set of input parameters, it could support architects in designing energy efficient buildings from the sketch design phase onwards. status: publishe...|$|R
