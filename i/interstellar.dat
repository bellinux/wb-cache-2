5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud or Local Fluff. It {{is thought}} to be near the {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the <b>interstellar</b> medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interstellar</b> {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of <b>interstellar</b> space are called the <b>interstellar</b> medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the <b>interstellar</b> medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the <b>interstellar</b> medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the <b>interstellar</b> medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the <b>interstellar</b> medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and <b>Interstellar</b> Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the <b>interstellar</b> magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{would be}} {{vulnerable}} to impacts from <b>interstellar</b> bodies, such as comets, meteoroids, and material in <b>interstellar</b> space that is currently being deflected by the Sun's bow shock. The heliosphere, and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the <b>interstellar</b> medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from <b>Interstellar</b> Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the <b>interstellar</b> medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of objects are {{observable}} at radio wavelengths, including supernovae, <b>interstellar</b> gas, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross <b>interstellar</b> space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular <b>interstellar</b> travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|An HII {{region or}} HII region is {{a region of}} <b>interstellar</b> atomic {{hydrogen}} that is ionized.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known <b>interstellar</b> molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in <b>interstellar</b> environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the <b>interstellar</b> set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of <b>interstellar</b> entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|As Voyager 1 {{headed for}} <b>interstellar</b> space, its {{instruments}} continued {{to study the}} Solar System. Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard Voyager 1 and 2 {{to look for the}} heliopause, the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the <b>interstellar</b> medium. , the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about 17030m/s.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the <b>interstellar</b> medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in <b>interstellar</b> gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|Deuterium {{was also}} {{detected}} {{in many other}} hydrogen compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in <b>interstellar</b> clouds, {{rather than in the}} solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in <b>interstellar</b> clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Further out, {{expanding}} gases {{from the}} Great Eruption collide with <b>interstellar</b> material and are heated to around , producing less energetic X-rays {{seen in a}} horseshoe or ring shape.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter <b>interstellar</b> space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was <b>interstellar</b> space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In <b>interstellar</b> astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to {{scattering}} processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} <b>interstellar</b> reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interstellar</b> {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse <b>interstellar</b> or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from <b>interstellar</b> space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the <b>interstellar</b> medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|No other {{spacecraft}} {{has ever}} visited the Uranian system or Titania, and no mission is currently planned. One possibility, now discarded, was to send Cassini on from Saturn to Uranus in an extended mission. Another mission concept proposed was the Uranus orbiter and probe concept, evaluated around 2010. Uranus was also examined {{as part of}} one trajectory for a precursor <b>interstellar</b> probe concept, Innovative <b>Interstellar</b> Explorer.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding <b>interstellar</b> medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding <b>interstellar</b> medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{and planetary}} magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy <b>interstellar</b> particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in the <b>interstellar</b> medium {{and the strength}} of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The local <b>interstellar</b> {{medium is}} {{a region of}} space within 100parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of {{interest}} both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which {{is characterized by a}} lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250pc or more.) This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local <b>interstellar</b> gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the <b>interstellar</b> medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm <b>interstellar</b> clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000K and radii of 0.5–5pc.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and <b>interstellar</b> space begins is not {{precisely}} defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the <b>interstellar</b> medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground <b>interstellar</b> medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because <b>interstellar</b> lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|These highly {{reactive}} molecules {{were previously}} known {{to contribute to}} building complex organics in the <b>Interstellar</b> Medium, therefore highlighting a possibly universal stepping stone to producing complex organic material.|$|E
5|$|A young star such as Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for <b>interstellar</b> travel in science fiction stories.|$|E
5|$|After {{between three}} and tenmillion years, the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into <b>interstellar</b> space, thus ending {{the growth of the}} planets.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed {{is the result of}} synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by <b>interstellar</b> gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Another massive {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's <b>interstellar</b> dust, {{was thought to}} be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several {{observations}} in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for <b>interstellar</b> travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} <b>interstellar</b> medium {{at a speed}} of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into the <b>interstellar</b> medium at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the <b>interstellar</b> medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, {{molecular}} clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds form {{on other}} planets, {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and possibly Neptune. They {{have even been}} seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain <b>interstellar</b> clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E
5|$|From the corona, {{a stellar}} wind of plasma {{particles}} expands {{outward from the}} star, until it interacts with the <b>interstellar</b> medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Warner Bros. relinquished to Paramount its {{rights to}} co-finance a {{potential}} future South Park movie, {{as well as}} a future Friday the 13th sequel, during their negotiations to co-finance the Christopher Nolan science fiction film <b>Interstellar.</b> Previous efforts to create a second South Park film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, <b>Interstellar</b> debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and <b>Interstellar,</b> {{which had the}} benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, The Martian was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The Martian played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The Martian did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interstellar</b> {{acetic acid}} was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the <b>interstellar</b> medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
