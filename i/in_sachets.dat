5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers <b>in</b> <b>sachets</b> of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E

2500|$|While these customs were {{unique to}} Russian culture, {{they were not}} {{exclusive}} to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism {{in other parts of}} the world. The Chinese concept of chi, a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices. [...] The western concept of an [...] "evil eye" [...] or a [...] "hex" [...] was translated to Russia as a [...] "spoiler". A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items <b>in</b> <b>sachet</b> <b>in</b> the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. [...] The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the last}} two years several cases of severe contact {{dermatitis}} related to newly acquired sofas and armchairs originating from China have been published. The responsible allergen is dimethylfumarate (DMF), an extremely potent sensitizer and irritant found <b>in</b> <b>sachets</b> inside the furniture. Recently, cases of contact dermatitis related to shoes and riding helmets have also been described. METHODS: We evaluated two patients with allergic contact dermatitis related to shoes manufactured in China that were contaminated by dimethylfumarate found <b>in</b> <b>sachets</b> placed inside the shoeboxes. RESULTS: Patch tests with DMF extracted from the sachets inside the shoeboxes showed positive reactions. Postitive reactions were also obtained using small fragments of the shoes and tissue of the "MouldProof" sachet. The patients were instructed to avoid the suspected shoes and were treated with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Contact dermatitis induced by dimethylfumarate should be suspected in appropriate cases. It {{is important to remember that}} this allergen is not included in most series for patch testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the microbial quality of milk powder based on the serving factors during milk powder serving process. The method used in {{this research}} was Total Plate Count (TPC). Nine sachets (400 g/sachet) of milk powder was used as many as This experiments used Split Plot Design, comprised three factors, storage factor (P 1, P 2 and P 3), time of serving factor (morning and evening), and shelf life factor (day of 1 st- 7 th). Each treatment consisted of three sachets of milk powder. Storage factors comprised P 1 (sachets packaging contained of milk powder were placed into the glass bottle container), P 2 (sachets packaging contained of milk powder were placed into glass botlle with spoon inside, and P 3 (sachets packaging contained of milk powder with spoon inside were not placed into the glass bottle container). The results of this research showed that storage factors and time of serving did not sifnificantly (P> 0, 05) affect on the microbial count of milk powder, but shelf life factor significanly (P< 0, 01) affected on microbial count of milk powder at day of 1 th and 7 th.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of iron based oxygen absorber systems comprising iron, sodium chloride, water, silica gel, activated carbon, monosodium glutamate, potassium acid tartrate, powdered cellulose, malic acid, chabazite, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium carbonate, sodium thiosulfate, propylene glycol, glycerin, polyethyleneglycol sorbitan monooleate, sodium propionate and clinoptilolite, incorporated <b>in</b> <b>sachets,</b> patches and cards. Iron, the main active ingredient reacts with oxygen to form iron hydroxide and iron oxide, thereby removing oxygen from the primary packaging. Only activated carbon has not been evaluated as such, but it meets the specifications for activated charcoal which is authorised as additive for plastic materials and articles in contact with foods. All other ingredients of the oxygen absorber formulations have been evaluated and approved for use as additives in plastic food contact materials and/or as food additives and/or food supplements or feed additives. The active system being based on solid ingredients and not intended for direct contact with liquid food or food with an external liquid surface, migration through the gas phase was screened for 9 representative active systems. No volatiles derived from the active mixtures were detected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the substances do not raise a safety concern when used in oxygen absorbers <b>in</b> <b>sachets,</b> patches or cards, placed in the headspace of the packaging or when used {{in direct contact with}} food, excluding liquid food or foods that have an external aqueous liquid phase on the surface such as sliced fruits and fresh meat...|$|E

Numerals are printed on an aluminium surface covered by a transparent plastic film, which can produce shadows or reflections in the image. The main difficulties for character recognition arise from low acquisition resolution, noise, heavy or light printing, and different printing patterns. The system must perform with an error rate lower than 0. 1 % and with the minimal computation time. Thus, we have decided to use well-known and simple algorithms, adding to them some refinements which take advantage of specific domainknowledge, making them more robust and reliable. The system is currently working with real production complying with the required specifications...|$|E
