According to regional scenarios, it is expected a reduction of periods of rain with an increased probability of heavy rainfall in a short time. In this sense the country still lacks systems to study rainfall patterns as well as early warning systems which increase the vulnerability of the populations especially those in unplanned settlements. In addition, many basins in Bolivia <b>do</b> <b>count</b> with integrated water resources management system in place with activities aimed at watershed protection. This translates into degradation of soils, declining aquifer recharge, reduced availability of water, which overall reduces economic productivity and income of its inhabitants.|$|E
