Brodifacoum (WBA 8119) was found most toxic since 66 % and 70 % of the animals died after one and two days' feeding respectively. Chlorophacinone killed 70 % of the squirrels after three days' feeding. Squirrels were relatively tolerant to warfarin and <b>fumarin</b> since the mortality {{after a period of}} 14 days' feeding was only 58 % and 75 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{to reduce}} populations of Spermophilus beldingi oregonus have {{centered}} around the application of Compound 10. 80 and strychnine baits. Additional population reduction techniques were investigated for possible employment into the squirrel program. Techniques which show much promise are: hand baited chopped gree bait (. 01 % chlorophacinone) broadcast (10 pounds per acre) and hand baited grain bait with. 01 % chlorophacinone and. 05 % <b>fumarin,</b> and bait stations using. 01 %,. 05 % chlorophacinone grain bait (100 and 200 foot spacing) and. 05 % <b>fumarin</b> grain bait (100 foot spacing). In addition, the concentration of Compound 1080 on chopped green bait {{can be reduced to}} 1 / 4 oz. of 1080 per 250 pounds of chopped green bait broadcast at 10 pounds per acre. Preliminary investigation in damage assessment using exclusion cylinders resulted in 123 squirrels per acre removing an average of 1, 790 pounds (spring growth alfalfa - downy broom) per acre in 44 days. Stomach content weights were determined over a 3 1 / 2 month period. Feeding behavior and average daily food consumption is greater early in the year (May) than later (July) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} testing dry {{anticoagulant}} baits at the Animal Biology Laboratory are evaluated in this paper. Overall, 14, 940 rats {{were committed to}} these tests resulting in a mortality rate of 91. 8 percent. The five chemicals tested and their mean mortality per test are: Diphacinone (93. 5 percent), Pival (87. 5 percent), Warfarin (93. 9 percent), Prolin (91. 2 percent), and <b>Fumarin</b> (92. 8 percent). The data indicates that 77. 4 percent of the tests conducted resulted in a mortality of 90 percent or greater, but only 11. 9 percent of them resulted in acceptance of 33 percent or greater and mortality of 90 percent or greater...|$|E

CALIFORNIA VERTEBRATE PEST CONFERENCE WONDER CHEMICALS The only wonder is that EPA still permits us to use any chemicals for controlling vertebrate animal damage. Anderson called Secretary Andrus a 2 ̆ 2 cuttlefish 2 ̆ 2 as the latter is as adept at squirting ink to hide his operations as is the marine squid. Anderson has documented some very questionable, Mafia-linked practices by Andrus when he was govenor of Idaho. Jack Anderson Andrus: Annoyed By Stories Of Past One of the immediate effects of Andrus selling out to the environmentalists has been the loss of a potentially effective tool incontroliing livestock depredation - - the 1080 toxic collar. A laboratory-field study of multiple-catch mouse traps - - 2 ̆ 2 Tin Cat 2 ̆ 2 ™ (Woodstream Corp.) and 2 ̆ 2 Ketch-all 2 ̆ 2 l|v 1 (Kness Mfg. Co.) - - has shown they areabout equal in effectiveness as in the field test they caught 36 and 37 mice respectively.
