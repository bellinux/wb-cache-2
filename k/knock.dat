5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to <b>knock</b> him out, and then <b>knock</b> them down with a tap.|$|E

50|$|Port <b>knocking</b> {{is totally}} {{dependent}} on the robustness of the port <b>knocking</b> daemon. The failure of the daemon will deny port access to all users and from a usability and security perspective, this is an undesirable single point of failure. Modern port <b>knocking</b> implementations mitigate this issue by providing a process monitoring daemon that will restart a failed or stalled port <b>knocking</b> daemon process.|$|R
5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven Sluices or Scots Float. <b>Knock</b> Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New <b>Knock</b> Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E

40|$|The device (1) has a spherical {{oscillating}} {{drive head}} (3) for <b>knocking</b> on a metallic workpiece surface (2), and an actuator (4) for {{activation of the}} oscillating drive head for an oscillation with a <b>knocking</b> frequency. A resonance frequency of the device is variably adjusted to the <b>knocking</b> frequency of the device. The resonance frequency of the device is variably adjusted to the <b>knocking</b> frequency in a continuous manner within a modification range.

50|$|The <b>knocking</b> player then subtracts {{his or her}} {{deadwood}} {{points from}} the defending player's deadwood points. The result {{is the number of}} points the <b>knocking</b> player receives. An undercut occurs if a player <b>knocks</b> and the defending player's deadwood points are {{less than or equal to}} the <b>knocking</b> player's. In this case the defending player receives an undercut bonus (usually 25 points) plus the difference in deadwood points. If the defending player has less or equal deadwood to the <b>knocking</b> player's deadwood after laying off any of his or her deadwood, then it is still a valid undercut.|$|R

5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, <b>knock</b> back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to <b>knock</b> off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E

50|$|During Scene Four at La Verna, the Angel <b>knocks</b> on {{the monastery}} door. Messiaen {{represents}} the <b>knocking</b> with a motif heavy pounding {{sounds in the}} percussion and strings. He saw these <b>knocks</b> as an entry of grace—a force one must not resist. The Angel's <b>knocking</b> foreshadows Francis’ eventual acceptance of the stigmata during Scene Seven. The main difference in Scene Seven is that the motif represents the painful, brutal pounding of nails into Christ's body.|$|R
