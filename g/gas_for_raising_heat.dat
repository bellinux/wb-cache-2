40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{convective}} heat exchange intensification due to two-dimensional depressions formed on the initially flat surface. This problem {{is of interest}} for engineering applications because many different convective surfaces have cavities and depressions of constructive or random occurrence.  During flow around a depression the boundary layer separation and its reattachment result in occurring specific phenomena, which {{have a significant impact}} on drag and heat exchange. The work involved an experimental study of hydrodynamic and heat characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer formed when there was an external airflow of the flat surface with a single transversal separation trench. The experimental part used an open subsonic low-turbulence wind tunnel operating in suction mode. A numerical simulation involves hydrodynamics and heat exchange parameters analysis via solution of the system of differential equations, which describe momentum and heat transport processes using ANSYS Fluent solver. The experimental data of this study are compared with numerical simulation results obtained by solving the steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) with a two-parametrical Menter k-ω (MSST) turbulence model. The comparison shows that simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data, heat exchange surface profiling by a transversal trench system with or without flow separation does not lead to increasing surface drag and, moreover, at the certain ratios of geometrical parameters (cylindrical trenches with h/S£ 0. 5) it can decrease the surface drag. Surface conjugations in these depressions should be smooth without any sharp curves and transitions, which can lead to forming stagnation regions. The reason <b>for</b> <b>raising</b> <b>heat</b> exchange is a spatial non-uniformity of the generated turbulence field. During flow analysis there were two sources of turbulence generation found out, namely a wall (heat exchange surface) and a mixing zone of main and trench flows. </p...|$|R

The supplementary heat source normally used by producers {{in order to}} maintain 29 - 31 °C in the building is obtained through burning GLP, associated with electrical thermal resistance. In some periods of the years 80 bottles of 13 kg of <b>gas</b> is needed <b>for</b> <b>raising</b> the flock's first three weeks.

The principle is based upon the use of a heated floor, with a thickness of 0. 30 m, and a full scale tank of heated water below the floor. A solar collector heats the water during daytime and, because of the concrete floor inertia, the heat migrates to the inside environment during the night. The simulated projected system using 15 solar collectors of 3 m 2, with the slope of 35 degrees was able to heat to a comfort zone, a flock housing of 90 m 2, during the coldest winter months...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} micro {{fluidized bed}} reaction analyzer (MFBRA) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) were adopted to comparatively investigate the non-isothermal gasification of coal char with CO 2. Experimental results demonstrated that heating rate obviously affected the coal char gasification reaction. <b>Raising</b> <b>heating</b> rate evidently increased the temperatures at the initiating reaction (T-i), the maximal reaction rate (T-m) and the finishing reaction (T-f). Nonetheless, it decreased the char conversion {{at a given}} reaction temperature and also the activation energy estimated by the single heating rate method. Comparing the data tested by TGA and MFBRA under the same heating rate clarified that the temperatures of T-i, T-m, and T-f were all relatively lower for MFBRA. The difference for such characteristic reaction temperatures between TGA and MFBRA increased with <b>raising</b> the <b>heating</b> rate. The measurement in MFBRA also led to the higher activation energy estimated according to both the single heating rate and the combination heating rate methods. Perhaps all these results are attributed to the lower limitation from heat and transfer including gas diffusion in MFBRA than in TGA. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{population}} growth are driving an ever increasing need to conserve water in Utah. One way to accomplish this is xeriscaping, which typically involves changing landscapes to utilize surfaces and materials that use less water. However, there can be tradeoffs that result from this type of water conservation, particularly the amplification of the Urban Heat Island effect. Compared with turf, xeriscaped surfaces absorb more sunlight (have a lower albedo) and use more of the absorbed energy <b>for</b> sensible <b>heat</b> (<b>raising</b> the temperature) than for latent heat (evaporating water without raising the temperature). Thus, turf may {{need a lot of}} water in order to grow, but evaporation of that water helps cool the surface. For these reasons, xeriscaping has the potential to raise temperatures when implemented on a large scale. Research was undertaken at Weber State University’s Ogden campus to investigate the microclimate effects of different surface types. A turf surface and a xeriscape surface were chosen, roughly 100 m apart {{on the west side of}} Elizabeth Hall. The two locations have similar weather exposures, such as solar radiation and shade, leaving surface characteristics as the main difference. Equal air and ground temperature measurements for the two surfaces were taken during the course of a two-month period. The data collected and recorded shows the xeriscape surface produces significantly higher temperatures compared with turf. These results clearly show the tradeoffs of water conservation, and indicate the possible consequences of large-scale xeriscaping at Weber State University’s Ogden campus...|$|R
