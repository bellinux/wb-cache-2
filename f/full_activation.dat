5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce <b>full</b> <b>activation</b> of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|Further {{military}} activities {{took place on}} 11 March. That morning one of the Allied submarines patrolling off Western Australia reported detecting radar signals from a Japanese warship, but this also {{proved to be a}} false alarm. Also that day, HMAS Adelaide escorted eight merchant ships to sea and then proceeded to Albany to protect the submarine tenders. In addition, the 10th Light Horse Regiment established coast watching positions, and an exercise practising the <b>full</b> <b>activation</b> of Volunteer Defence Force-manned coastal and anti-aircraft defences on the night of 11/12 March was successful.|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for <b>full</b> <b>activation.</b> Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E

50|$|Normally, {{eating is}} {{pleasant}} {{when an individual}} is hungry and less pleasant when an individual is <b>full.</b> Neuronal <b>activation</b> in the OFC decreases when an individual is full, however there is a disturbance in this pathway in individuals with AN and BN. Thus, patients with AN have little response to food or a quick response to being full, and patients with BN have an exaggerated response to food or a decrease in feeling full.|$|R
50|$|CD45 steric {{exclusion}} {{extends the}} phosphorylation half-lives of TCR/peptide-MHC complexes, which are trapped within the close-contact zone. Such prolonged phosphorylation of ITAMs by Lck kinase allows time for ZAP-70 recruitment, its activation by phosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76, all known as downstream signaling steps. <b>Full</b> T-cell <b>activation</b> is initiated by multiple triggering events described above. When T-cell and APC membranes separate, the close-contact zone vanishes and large-ectodomain tyrosine phosphatases {{are allowed to}} restore the ground state.|$|R

30|$|When PRT is {{set equal}} to 0.9 s the tieline {{oscillation}} is reinforced, gradually increasing in amplitude and activating more PFC reserves over time, which eventually leads {{the system to}} an unstable operation (PRT values smaller or equal to 0.8 s {{did not lead to}} instability). The period of the oscillation is approximately 0.2 s, corresponding to the frequency of the inter-area mode. Simulations showed that a relatively large PRT combined with a <b>full</b> reserve <b>activation</b> in one time step can lead to system instability.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of worker queen conflict {{among members of}} D. norwegica. Few workers were detected to have <b>full</b> ovary <b>activation</b> and were producing males.

Workers may kill off their queens so that they can reproduce: there was no queens found on collection of 12 out of 14 D. norwegica nests. Queens are often recognizable due to their heavily, worn wings. Matricide is common after workers are reared and queens have laid their eggs in annual colonies with low paternity.|$|R

50|$|Once {{correctly}} {{positioned in}} the membrane via binding of PIP3, Akt {{can then be}} phosphorylated by its activating kinases, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and PDK2. Serine473, the hydrophobic motif, is phosphorylated in an mTORC2-dependent manner, leading some investigators to hypothesize that mTORC2 is the long-sought PDK2 molecule. Threonine308, the activation loop, is phosphorylated by PDK1, allowing <b>full</b> Akt <b>activation.</b> Activated Akt can {{then go on to}} activate or deactivate its myriad substrates via its kinase activity. The PHLPPs therefore antagonize PDK1 and PDK2, since they dephosphorylate the site that PDK2 phosphorylates.|$|R
50|$|The phosphatases in the PHLPP family, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 {{have been}} shown to {{directly}} dephosphorylate, and therefore inactivate, distinct Akt isoforms, at one of the two critical phosphorylation sites required for activation: Serine473. PHLPP2 dephosphorylates AKT1 and AKT3, whereas PHLPP1 is specific for AKT2 and AKT3. Lack of PHLPP appears to have effects on growth factor-induced Akt phosphorylation. When both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 are knocked down using siRNA and cells are stimulated using epidermal growth factor, peak Akt phosphorylation at both Serine473 and Threonine308 (the other site required for <b>full</b> Akt <b>activation)</b> is increased dramatically.|$|R

5000|$|Not {{only does}} Ste5 {{contribute}} to propagation of the pheromone signal, {{but it is}} also involved in down regulating of signalling. It stimulates autophosphorylation of Fus3, which results in phosphorylation of Ste5, causing a downregulation in signalling. [...] Ste5 also catalytically unlocks Fus3 (but not it’s homologue Kss1) for phosphorylation by Ste7. Both this catalytically active Ste5 domain as well as Ste7 are required for <b>full</b> Fus3 <b>activation,</b> which explains why Fus3 is activated by only the mating pathway, and remains inactive during other pathways which also utilize Ste7.|$|R
40|$|Engagement of the T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) {{in human}} primary T cells activates a cyclic AMP (cAMP) -protein kinase A (PKA) -Csk inhibitory pathway that prevents <b>full</b> T-cell <b>activation</b> {{in the absence}} of a coreceptor stimulus. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of CD 28 leads to recruitment to lipid rafts of a -arrestin/ phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) complex that serves to degrade cAMP locally. Redistribution of the complex from the cytosol depends on Lck and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) activity. Protein kinase B (PKB) interacts directly with -arrestin to form part of the supramolecular complex together with sequestered PDE 4. Trans-location is mediated by the PKB plextrin homology (PH) domain, thus revealing a new role for PKB as an adaptor coupling PI 3 K and cAMP signaling. Functionally, PI 3 K activation and phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5) -triphosphate (PIP 3) production, leading to recruitment of the supramolecular PKB/-arrestin/PDE 4 complex to the membrane via the PKB PH domain, results in degradation of the TCR-induced cAMP pool located in lipid rafts, thereby allowing <b>full</b> T-cell <b>activation</b> to proceed. T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation alone is insufficient for activation of T cells, and sustainable T-cell immune responses require a second signal in addition to the TCR-mediated sig-nal. The second signal is typically elicited by ligands B 7 - 1 o...|$|R
25|$|The {{idea that}} {{modifications}} act as docking modules for related factors is {{borne out by}} histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive heterochromatin). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein HP1 recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for <b>full)</b> transcriptional <b>activation.</b> Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.|$|R
