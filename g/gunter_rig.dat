50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that while the term yard is {{normally}} employed to name a spar which crosses a mast, and gaff one which is fastened to the mast at its forward point — as it is in the case of the <b>gunter</b> <b>rig.</b> However, since the <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> is derived from lug rigs - where the spar from which the sail hangs is always called the yard, rather than from gaff rig - despite the similarity between a high peaked gaff rig and a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> the spar will often be referred to either as a gaff or a yard.|$|E

50|$|Reefing a <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged</b> {{boat with}} a single halyard {{requires}} the sail to be fully lowered into the boat and (usually) the halyard repositioned on the yard or (rarely) the sail to be moved downwards along the yard. However some <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged</b> boats, certainly amongst dinghies, have an additional halyard {{from the end of}} the yard, to hoist the sail once the yard is hoisted; these are still technically <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged</b> but have borrowed some of the characteristics of the Bermudian rig; essentially the yard is hosted fully and then left in position and regarded as a semi-permanent topmast, with the sail raised up or down it as required.|$|R
50|$|Gunter-rigged {{boats are}} similar, smaller vessels {{on which a}} spar popularly but {{incorrectly}} called the gaff is raised until it is nearly vertical, parallel to the mast and close adjacent to it. Topsails are never carried on <b>gunter</b> <b>rigs.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{looks like}} a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> when the boat is fully rigged. However {{it does not have}} the sliding {{component}} of the wire or the hooped gunter.|$|E
50|$|Fore-and-aft rigged sails include staysails, Bermuda rigged sails, gaff rigged sails, gaff sails, <b>gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> lateen sails, lug sails, the spanker sail on {{a square}} rig and crab claw sails.|$|E
50|$|It has twin fixed bilge keels, and {{a simple}} sail plan of headsail and mainsail. The {{original}} design was for <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> {{but there are also}} many Bermuda rig examples.|$|E
50|$|Parrel beads (also spelled parral or parrell) are {{an element}} of sailing rigging, usually {{deployed}} at the jaws of a gaff on a gaff <b>rigged</b> or <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged</b> craft, or on the tack of a spinnaker rigged over a furled jib.|$|R

50|$|The Do-it-yourself Mermaid is an 11 foot (3.4m) plywood {{sailing dinghy}} {{designed}} by Roger Hancock in 1962. Usually built at home, it {{is suitable for}} a crew of two or three. It can be sailed, rowed or motored and can be trailed or car-topped. The boat is <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged,</b> with one size of jib. A spinnaker is used for racing.|$|R
5000|$|A sail rig which {{resembles a}} gaff rig, with the gaff nearly vertical, {{is called a}} <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> or [...] "sliding gunter" [...] from its {{resemblance}} to a Gunters rule.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gunter</b> <b>rig</b> is {{normally}} used on small gaff rigged sailing vessels, such as sailing canoes (not the International Canoe) and dinghies where the gaff is carried very nearly vertical, forming an extension to the mast {{so that the}} sail is triangular, resembling a Bermuda rig. The effect {{is to have a}} topmast (the gaff) which is a pseudo telescopic extension of the shorter mast. One reason given for the popularity of the <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> in dinghies is that the mast and yard are sufficiently short to pack neatly inside the hull when a boat is being trailed behind a car.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> {{is often}} used for smaller boats where the mast is {{frequently}} taken down; the mast is made short enough to be stored flat inside the boat. The popular Mirror class of racing dinghy is gunter-rigged for this reason.|$|E
50|$|The large {{fore-and-aft sail}} on the {{mainmast}} is the mainsail, while the sail on the mizzen mast is the mizzen. These sails may be {{any type of}} fore-and-aft sail, in any combination. Most modern ketches are Bermuda rigged, but other possible rigs on a ketch include <b>gunter</b> <b>rigs</b> and gaff rigs. The Scots Zulu, for example, had a dipping lug main with a standing lug mizzen.|$|R
5000|$|Zeddie ( [...] or Z Class or Takapuna) {{is an old}} New Zealand sailing dinghy. The first {{boat was}} {{designed}} and built by Mr R.B. Brown at Northcote (Auckland, New Zealand) in the 1920s. The Zeddie originally was <b>gunter</b> <b>rigged,</b> which shortened the spars for convenience. Some have been converted to Bermudan, no jib and a spinnaker which was sheeted around {{the front of the}} mast leading to many capsizes. This rule was changed in the interests of safety. The Zeddie is 12 foot 6 inches long and about 5 foot in the beam.|$|R
50|$|Early models {{included}} the mast base clip and gunwale holes {{to use with}} the Grumman factory sail kit, with either a <b>gunter</b> or lateen <b>rig.</b> Sail kits are long out of production.|$|R
50|$|Most coypu mainsails are {{normally}} raised by feeding the luff into the track on the mast, although some variants have <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> sails. The mainsheet is {{fixed to the}} stern of the boat. A jib is used for normal use and only one size is available.|$|E
50|$|The {{spine of}} the boat is an {{extended}} centreboard case running from stem to stern, which gives enormous strength to the hull structure. The <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> design allows the spars to be easily stored inside the boat and kept under a flat cover when not in use.|$|E
50|$|The ASC or Admiralty Sailing Craft (sometimes {{incorrectly}} called Admiralty Sea Cadet) is {{a purpose}} built, rugged GRP or wood sailing dinghy, historically with <b>gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> with a bermuda rig optional, {{designed for use}} by UK naval and sea cadet establishments as a pulling or sailing dinghy.|$|E
50|$|The Sandweaver 16 {{is an open}} 16 ft dayboat with <b>Gunter</b> or Bermuda <b>rig.</b> It {{is based}} on a Blakeney one design which in turn was based on an Uffa ACE 18. The hull is {{simulated}} clinker and there were 11 built by Goodchild Marine in Great Yarmouth, England.|$|R
5000|$|Denys Arthur Rayner DSC & Bar, VRD, RNVR (9 February 1908 - 4 January 1967) was a Royal Navy {{officer who}} fought {{throughout}} the Battle of the Atlantic. After intensive war service at sea, Rayner became a writer, a farmer, and a successful designer and builder of small sailing craft - his first being the Westcoaster; his most successful being the glass fibre <b>gunter</b> or Bermudian <b>rigged</b> twin keel Westerly 22 from which evolved similar [...] "small ships" [...] able to cross oceans while respecting the expectations, {{in terms of}} comfort, safety and cost, of a burgeoning family market keen to get to sea. Before his death in 1967, Rayner had founded, and via his pioneering GRP designs, secured the future expansion of Westerly Marine Construction Ltd - up until the late 1980s, one of Britain's most successful yacht builders.|$|R

The vessel third {{from the right}} has an almost {{triangular}} shoulder-of-mutton rig, similar to the Bermuda rig-mimicking <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig.</b> Others have booms angled upwards, above the masts, a design with similarity to the Bermuda rig with a horizontal boom.|$|E
50|$|The Shannon-One-Design {{sailing dinghy}} {{is a small}} sailing boat raced on the River Shannon and Loughs Ree and Derg in Ireland. The boats are 18 ft long by 4 ft beam, drawing 4 ft with her {{centreboard}} down. They have a sail area of 140 square feet (15.6m2) set in a single sail, giving the boat {{what is called a}} <b>gunter</b> <b>rig.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} rig was a <b>Gunter</b> <b>Rig,</b> but in 2006 {{the class}} rules were changed {{to allow a}} single mast and an alloy boom. Although a Bermudan sloop rig has now been introduced for the Mirror, the original <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig</b> (with a gaff that effectively doubles {{the height of the}} mast) meant that all the spars could be packed inside the hull for easy storage or transportation. This same space saving is still available with the Bermudan rig by using an optional two-piece aluminium mast. Mirrors can be sailed without a jib by moving the mast into an optional forward step and moving the shroud attachment points forward. However, in this configuration {{it can be difficult to}} tack, so it would mainly be used to de-power the boat for beginners. Most single handers retain the mast in the standard position and handle the jib as well: because of the Mirror's small size, this is quite manageable.|$|E
50|$|Several {{versions}} of the Otter were manufactured. The original design consisted of a single skin glass fibre hull and a <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig</b> (without spinnaker). Later models used the more successful Bermudan rig (with optional spinnaker), and a double skinned 'unsinkable' hull with integrated buoyancy tanks. The hull weight and sail area depend on the version. The picture to the right shows the original wooden masted Gunter sailplan.|$|E
50|$|Designed by John Watkinson in 1973, the Peterboat was not mass-produced {{and never}} built in GRP. Only about 10 wooden boats were built by John Elliott, John Kerr, and Norman Whyte. There was an {{original}} {{version of a}} 19 ft Peterboat built by John Watkinson, similar decking arrangement to the drascombe Lugger, but with a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> sporting a curved yard with a large jib,(similar to the rig on 'Cariad') only the one was ever built.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "crabclaw sail" [...] is {{also used}} for non-shunting sails that widen upwards. The 'ōpe'a, the upper spar, is braced up so high that it is nearly {{parallel}} to the mast (as in a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig).</b> The paepae, the lower spar/boom, points well above the horizontal, unlike the boom of most gunter rigs and gaff rigs. The two spars can be brought together or pulled apart with control lines (rigging diagram). The mast is fixed and stayed.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} raters have {{developed}} extraordinarily tall masts and high aspect mainsails {{to meet the}} local conditions, and catch the wind above the trees and other obstructions along the banks. Their sails were always large, but originally they had long booms and shorter masts, but over time the booms got shorter and the masts taller. At first they used the so-called balance lug rig, then the <b>Gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> {{before moving on to}} the current Bermuda rig. Over the years bamboo spars were replaced first by wood, then aluminium, and now mostly carbon fibre.|$|E
50|$|The P-Class was {{designed}} by New Zealand civil engineer, Harry Highet, as a simple vessel in which {{children and young people}} could learn to sail. It is a 2.13 metre long, slab sided, v bottom single hull, single sail Bermuda rigged dinghy, and is designed to be sailed by one person. The low aspect ratio Bermudan rig took over from a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> in the 1950s. The boom overhangs the stern of the boat. It has a small deep cockpit {{with the rest of the}} hull making water tight buoyancy compartments. When capsized the boat floats very high in the water. The hull has a minimum weight of 90 lbs so is very solid. Even 40-year-old boats can be bought in good condition.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902 several {{club members}} got {{together}} and commissioned the Fairy Class racing dayboat design. This Class has been sailed locally since then and {{although some of the}} boats migrated to Lough Erne the Class is still strongly supported at Cultra. Some of the boats have been substantially rebuilt in recent years. Club members have always been ready to accept new designs and in the 1930s the then new Dragon Class was adopted. Actually, LEYC (Lough Erne [...] ) commissioned a fleet of fairies identical to the RNIYC fleet. All were shipped on the railway to Enniskillen-then LEYC's location. Some still exist there sailed with the original <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> abandoned in favour of Bermudan by RNIYC {{towards the end of the}} 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|A single loose-footed {{square sail}} {{hung from a}} yard was likely the oldest form of sail, as woven cloth is {{initially}} square. Ancient Egyptian boats had a single square sail with two yards, top and bottom. A lugsail is similar, but the yard is pulled offcenter, making it more weatherly {{so that it can}} go more quickly upwind. A settee sail is a lugsail with one very short side. If the lug is so offcenter that one end is attached to the mast, it is a gaff rig. A spritsail is like a gaff, but the [...] "gaff" [...] runs diagonally across the face of the sail and supports the peak of the sail, and is therefor called a sprit. If the [...] "gaff" [...] is bound nearly parallel to the mast, it becomes a <b>gunter</b> <b>rig.</b> If the sail is a triangle strung between the mast and the horizontal boom, it is a Bermuda rig.|$|E
50|$|Sea Scouts New Zealand {{are part}} of Scouting New Zealand. There are around 900 Sea Scouts in New Zealand in 60 troops around the country. The New Zealand Sea Scouts use a 17-foot cutter as their {{principal}} boat - the concept of having a specific boat for Sea Scouts in New Zealand originated in 1944. The first two boats of this class were ready for the 1st National Dominion Regatta in 1945. The original boats were clinker built and used Kauri as the main timber. The rig was a gunter designed {{so that all the}} spars could be stowed inside the boat for towing. These wooden cutters are still in use today including the first built. They continued to be built in the original manner until the early 1970s; around 140 were built over this period. In the late 1960s and early 1970, fibreglass versions of the cutters began to be produced, the hull being identical in shape and size but the <b>gunter</b> <b>rig</b> was replaced with a Bermudan design using aluminium mast and boom. These boats are still in production and around 90 have been built.|$|E
5000|$|Wartime {{advances}} in new bonding techniques had made plywood reliable even when constantly immersed in sea water. Using mahogany frames {{and the new}} marine plywood laminated with resorcinol glues, Rayner marked {{his return to the}} sea by building a 20-foot hard chine bilge keel gunter-rigged sloop - the Westcoaster - designed initially for a customer wishing to navigate the difficult waters and scarce harbours of the Bristol Channel, where Rayner had been torpedoed in 1944. Rayner gave the Westcoaster [...] "sitting head room for tall men" [...] - rare in yachts so small - while ingeniously camouflaging the reverse sheer needed for such generous accommodation by carrying the decks out to the sides of the boat as he had with Robinetta 20 years earlier. Similarly all the Westcoasters running rigging came back to the cockpit making her easy to handle single-handed. He sailed and demonstrated the first of such yachts, painted a rich royal international blue - often called Oxford Blue - enthusing about its good looks, its affordability, its practicality for weekend [...] "pottering" [...] and fitness for deeper waters despite a draft of no more than 23" [...] (70 cm). This design ensemble was topped by Rayners preference for the <b>gunter</b> <b>rig,</b> its short mast, compared to a Bermudian, making it easier to tow on a trailer, to lower and raise, for the bridges of inland waterways, as well as allowing a swift reef - by lowering the boom - in a squall. Rayner also wrote that he valued the greater lifting quality of a gaff or gunter mainsail as compared to the Bermudian main, prior to the wider use, with that rig, of masthead Genoas - headsails of greater area than the mainsail - which in Rayners view, in 1962, was the herald of rigs to come with great aerodynamic efficiency and with enormous lift!, and returning, in effect, [...] "to the lateen-shaped loose-footed sails of the Mediterranean but with a taut forestay replacing the heavy lateen yard..." [...] A small number of Westcoasters were later modified by the addition of a small bowsprit, with the cutter rig giving an even greater sail area.|$|E
