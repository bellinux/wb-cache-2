40|$|This is {{the first}} part of an article in two parts, which builds the {{foundation}} of a Floer-theoretic invariant, IF. The Floer homology can be trivial in many variants of the Floer theory; it is therefore interesting to consider more refined invariants of the Floer complex. We consider one such instance—the Reidemeister torsion τF of the Floer-Novikov complex of (possibly non-hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms. τF turns out not to be invariant under hamiltonian <b>isotopies,</b> but this failure may be fixed by introducing certain “correction term”: We define a Floer-theoretic zeta function ζF, by counting perturbed pseudo-holomorphic tori in a way very similar to the genus 1 Gromov invariant.

40|$|A local {{deformation}} property for uniform embeddings in metric manifolds (LD) is formulated and its behaviour is studied {{in a formal}} view point. It is shown that any metric manifold with a geometric group action, typical metric spaces (Euclidean space, hyperbolic space and cylinders) and for κ≤ 0 the κ-cone ends over any compact Lipschitz metric manifolds, {{all of them have}} the property (LD). We also formulate a notion of end deformation property for uniform embeddings over proper product ends (ED). For example, the 0 -cone end over a compact metric manifold has the property (ED) if it has the property (LD). It is shown that if a metric manifold M has finitely many proper product ends with the property (ED), then the group of bounded uniform homeomorphisms of M endowed with the uniform topology admits a strong deformation retraction onto the subgroup of bounded uniform homeomorphisms which are identity over those ends.
