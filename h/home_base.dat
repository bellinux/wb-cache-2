40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS is fast {{becoming}} a chronic disease {{with the advent of}} antiretroviral drugs, therefore making <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care key in the management of chronically ill HIV/AIDS patient. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the perception and practice of health care workers on HIV/AIDS related <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care in the health facilities in Ogun state, Nigeria. Methods This study is an analytical cross-sectional study. A multistage cluster sampling technique was used to obtain a representative sample of the primary health care workers in Ogun state. An interviewer administered structured questionnaire was administered by trained health workers to elicit the required information. Result A total of 350 health care workers were interviewed, 70 % of the respondents could adequately describe the components of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care. Only 38. 7 % were aware of the National guideline on <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care practices and 17. 1 % believe that <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care will not significantly improve the prognosis of PLWAs. Few 19. 1 % had ever been trained or ever involved 16. 6 % in <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care practices. Only 20 [5. 7 %] are involved on a weekly basis, 16 [4. 6 %] monthly and 22 [6. 3 %] quarterly. Reasons given for non implementation of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care are inadequate number of healthcare workers 45 %, lack of political will 24. 4 %, lack of implementation by facility managers 14 % and inadequate funds 16. 6 %. Factors that were significantly associated with the practice of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care were perception of its relevance in improving prognosis [OR[*]=[*] 54. 21, C. I[*]=[*] 23. 22 - 129. 52] and presence of a support group in the facility [OR[*]=[*] 4. 80, C. I[*]=[*] 2. 40 - 9. 57]. There was however no statistically significant relationship between adequate knowledge of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care [OR[*]=[*] 0. 78, C. I[*]=[*] 0. 39 - 1. 54] and previous training on <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care (OR[*]=[*] 1. 43, C. I[*]=[*] 0. 66 - 3. 06]. Conclusion The practice of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care for HIV/AIDS among the study population is low and it is greatly influenced by perception of its effectiveness and relevance. The study recommends that the health care workers should be adequately educated on the importance of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care in the management of chronic illnesses in order to enhance its practice. </p...|$|R

It might even lead to a change in chain governance from a captive towards a relational one, in which there is more trust and mutual dependence between producer and buyer.

However, {{a deeper understanding of the}} challenges facing community organizations when providing <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care is crucial and necessary in order to formulate effective and relevant care services.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness {{and the costs of}} multidisciplinary <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care in multiple sclerosis with hospital care in a prospective randomised controlled trial with a one year follow up. METHODS: 201 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were studied. They were randomised in a ratio 2 : 1 to an intervention group (133) or a control group (68). They were assessed at baseline and one year after randomisation with validated measures of physical and psychological impairment and quality of life (SF- 36 health survey). The costs to the National Health Service over the one year follow up were calculated by a cost minimisation analysis. RESULTS: There were no differences in functional status between the <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care group and the hospital group. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two groups favouring <b>home</b> <b>based</b> management in four SF- 36 health dimensions-general health, bodily pain, role-emotional, and social functioning (all p < or = 0. 001). The cost of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care was slightly less (822 euros/patient/year) than hospital care, mainly as a result of a reduction in hospital admissions.
