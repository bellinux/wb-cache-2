5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of a developing a <b>home-grown</b> aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
5|$|When Davis {{and other}} youngsters signed new deals in 2011, McCarthy had said they stood less chance of first-team {{football}} in the Premier League {{than when the}} team were playing in the Championship. A year later and back in the Championship, Davis was in the team {{at the beginning of}} the season, but lost form and returned to the reserves. By November, he was again challenging for a first-team place, and manager Ståle Solbakken turned down the chance to re-sign Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong, still regaining fitness after serious injury, preferring to let the <b>home-grown</b> product prove himself. Davis featured regularly, but more often from the bench than in the starting eleven.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Real Madrid {{had lost its}} grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of <b>home-grown</b> stars brought {{domestic}} success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which {{was derived from the}} nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.|$|E
5|$|Frank McLintock, a noted {{player for}} seven years for Leicester in a {{successful}} period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980. Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous <b>home-grown</b> players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.|$|E
5|$|Around 1730, the Baroque style {{gradually}} {{began to}} break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of <b>home-grown</b> Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by <b>home-grown</b> resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, the Abbott Government {{committed}} a further AU$450 million to fight <b>home-grown</b> terrorism.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues {{to follow the}} precedent set by Wickard v. Filburn. In Gonzales v. Raich it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of <b>home-grown</b> cannabis even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, <b>home-grown</b> cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>home-grown</b> rock and pop {{music in the}} 1960s and 70s was built upon with enthusiasm in the 1980s, during which time several influential Lithuanian bands emerged.|$|E
25|$|This series' storylines {{include a}} fake <b>home-grown</b> Al-Qaeda cell that plans {{an attack on}} London; the British {{government}} selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia; and the US administration selling arms to African dictators.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 CommSec {{became the}} first Australian {{brokerage}} firm to offer a brokerage website specifically designed for a portable-device. It created CommSec iPhone Edition for the Apple iPhone, the first <b>home-grown</b> iPhone application in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{musical and}} social {{movement}} of hip hop in South Africa has grown exponentially {{in the last}} two decades, most notoriously in the form of <b>home-grown</b> Kwaito, which is actually a distinct musical genre in itself.|$|E
25|$|Wells and Verne {{both had}} an {{international}} readership and influenced writers in America, especially. Soon a <b>home-grown</b> American science fiction was thriving. European writers found more readers by selling to the American market {{and writing in}} an Americanised style.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to raise}} the level of {{awareness}} of Northumberland culture have also started, with the formation of a Northumbrian Language Society to preserve the unique dialects (Pitmatic and other Northumbrian dialects) of this region, as well as to promote <b>home-grown</b> talent.|$|E
25|$|Several other basils, {{including}} some other Ocimum species, are grown {{in many regions}} of Asia. Most of the Asian basils have a clove-like flavor that is, in general, stronger than the Mediterranean basils. The most notable is the holy basil or tulsi, a revered <b>home-grown</b> plant in India and Nepal.|$|E
25|$|All this {{is further}} {{evidence}} that Braham's singing showed similar traces of ‘otherness’ to that of Leoni, whose use of falsetto was also characteristic, and that this relic of Braham’s early training was amongst the factors enabling him to present a singing style clearly demarcated, for the cognoscenti, from both the prevalent Italian and <b>home-grown</b> English styles.|$|E
25|$|Ballarat {{also has}} {{a large number of}} <b>home-grown</b> {{companies}} producing textiles, general industrial engineering, food products, brick and tiles, building components, prefabricated housing components and automotive components. Brewing was once a large-scale operation, with many large businesses including the public company Phoenix Brewery, and although large-scale brewing has ceased, the city retains a substantial microbrewery industry.|$|E
25|$|The 2016 BPL {{draft was}} held on 30 September. Prior to the draft, the seven clubs signed 38 foreign players to {{contracts}} and each existing franchise was able to retain two <b>home-grown</b> players from the 2015 season. A total 301 players participated in the draft, including 133 local and 168 foreign players. 85 players were selected in the draft.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Judah HaNasi, taking as an exemplum an {{act that}} he heard {{performed}} by Rabbi Meir, released the entire region of Beit Shean from the obligations of tithing <b>home-grown</b> produce, and from observing the Seventh Year laws {{with respect to the}} same produce. He also did the same for the cities of Kefar Tzemach, Caesarea and Beit Gubrin.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{is known}} for its <b>home-grown</b> {{tradition}} of theatre. Kuwait is the only country in the Gulf with a theatrical tradition. The theatrical movement in Kuwait constitutes {{a major part of the}} country's cultural life. Theatrical activities in Kuwait began in the 1920s when the first spoken dramas were released. Theatre activities are still popular today. Abdulhussain Abdulredha is the most prominent actor.|$|E
25|$|Cucumbers, dill pickles, {{radishes}} {{and greens}} are quite popular. Beets (burokai) are grown more widely {{than in other}} areas of the world, and are often used for making borscht and side dishes. Cabbage is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for soups, or wrapped around fillings (balandėliai). Tomatoes are now available year-round in stores, but those <b>home-grown</b> in family greenhouses are still considered superior.|$|E
25|$|Through Galaction's interventions, Viața Socială {{maintained}} {{links with}} the more mainstream and <b>home-grown</b> current on Romania's leftist scene, Poporanism, {{as well as with}} the post-socialist magazine of Iași, Viața Românească. It also published several poems by the young Poporanist George Topîrceanu. Also in Iași, the Viața Socială circle acquired a number of young disciples, involved in editing Fronda and Absolutio magazines: Isac Ludo, Eugen Relgis etc.|$|E
25|$|Viewership on the CBC's French {{television}} network has also declined, {{mostly because of}} stiff competition from private French-language networks. Audience fragmentation is another issue. However, {{in contrast to the}} anglophone audience, French Canadians prefer <b>home-grown</b> television programming, a vibrant Quebec star system is in place, and little American or foreign content airs on French-language networks, public or private. And the CBC's French-language radio channel is sometimes the top-rated network.|$|E
25|$|Change came in {{the late}} 1950s with the {{recruitment}} of the charismatic Willie Watson {{at the end of}} a distinguished career with England and Yorkshire. Watson's run gathering sparked the <b>home-grown</b> Maurice Hallam into becoming one of England's best opening batsmen. In bowling, Leicestershire had an erratically successful group of seamers in Terry Spencer, Brian Boshier, John Cotton and Jack van Geloven, plus the spin of John Savage.|$|E
25|$|Knobkerry, alias Green Grass, alias Interim Megaton Weapon, alias Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1, had {{one other}} distinction. It {{was the last}} entirely British nuclear weapon {{deployed}} with the UK Armed Services. The British Operation Grapple thermonuclear weapon tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 were the end of evolution. There were no more wholly <b>home-grown</b> designs. Britain never deployed a true thermonuclear weapon of wholly <b>home-grown</b> design. All the weapons tested at Operation Grapple were abandoned, because AWRE no longer needed them, although some of their features were undoubtedly incorporated into later weapons. These Granite-type devices were all experimental devices, needing to be developed further into reliable Service-engineered warheads at considerable cost in time and money. The U.S. designs offered after 1958 were fully tested and engineered, and cheap to produce. They were manufactured in Britain from British materials and U.S. blueprints. They were British property {{and there were no}} American political constraints on their use, they were a favourable deal for the Treasury, and Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bridged the gap until the American designs could be manufactured.|$|E
25|$|Roebuck and his {{supporters}} argued that both Richards and Garner were now ageing, that individually and collectively their contributions had declined dramatically and that younger overseas and <b>home-grown</b> players should be recruited to replace them. They cited the recent performance of the team in the County Championship – namely, bottom in 1985 and next-bottom in 1986 – and their failure in one-day competitions since winning the NatWest Bank Trophy in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The war created severe {{shortages}} of permanent way materials {{and a number}} of little used sidings were lifted for the materials they yielded. It was also necessary to resort to using sleepers made from <b>home-grown</b> timber rather than the imported Baltic variety. Steel boiler tubes replaced copper and brass in locomotives for economy and a different pattern of uniform overcoat had to be sourced since the government had commandeered the wool crop.|$|E
25|$|Bedier {{has been}} very active in helping the Muslim {{community}} learn {{how to work with}} law enforcement {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>home-grown</b> terrorism. After the UK airline plot was foiled in 2006, Bedier organized a meeting between law enforcement chiefs from 20 different agencies, both local and federal. The purpose of the meeting was to learn what to look for and how to work with law enforcement so that suspicious activities are reported effectively.|$|E
25|$|For 1998–99, Redknapp again {{turned his}} {{transfer}} attention overseas and signed former French international Marc Keller, Cameroonian midfielder Marc-Vivien Foé and Chilean international Javier Margas. Redknapp, however, did not neglect <b>home-grown</b> talent, adding the experienced Ian Wright and Neil Ruddock, whilst also bringing Scott Minto back from abroad and Shaka Hislop in as goalkeeper on a free transfer from Newcastle. Hislop {{went on to}} win the Hammer of the Year award in his first season.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of <b>home-grown</b> grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 3,500 {{oil and gas}} (O) {{businesses}} in Malaysia comprising international oil companies, independents, services and manufacturig companies that support {{the needs of the}} O value chain both domestically and regionally. Many major global machinery & equipment (M) manufacturers have set up bases in Malaysia to complement <b>home-grown</b> M companies, while other Malaysian oil and gas companies are focused on key strategic segments such as marine, drilling, engineering, fabrication, offshore installation and operations and maintenance (O).|$|E
25|$|Watermarks are not {{complete}} DRM mechanisms {{in their own}} right, but are used {{as part of a}} system for copyright enforcement, such as helping provide prosecution evidence for legal purposes, rather than direct technological restriction. Some programs used to edit video and/or audio may distort, delete, or otherwise interfere with watermarks. Signal/modulator-carrier chromatography may also separate watermarks from original audio or detect them as glitches. Additionally, comparison of two separately obtained copies of audio using simple, <b>home-grown</b> algorithms can often reveal watermarks.|$|E
25|$|Besides Arne, {{the other}} {{dominating}} force in English opera {{at this time}} was George Frideric Handel, whose opera serias filled the London operatic stages for decades, and influenced most <b>home-grown</b> composers, like John Frederick Lampe, who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including {{in the work of}} Michael William Balfe, and the operas of the great Italian composers, {{as well as those of}} Mozart, Beethoven and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.|$|E
25|$|This new {{attitude}} became firmly set into place in 1942. In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court ruled that production quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, <b>home-grown</b> wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed {{it within the}} power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision {{marked the beginning of}} the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The handgun {{was adopted}} into service with the Austrian {{military}} and police forces in 1982 as the P80 (Pistole 80), with an initial order for 25,000 guns. The Glock 17 outperformed eight different pistols from five other established manufacturers (Heckler & Koch of Germany offered their P7M8, P7M13, and P9S, SIG Sauer of Switzerland bid with their P220 and P226 models, Beretta of Italy submitted their model 92SB-F, FN Herstal proposed an updated variant of the Browning Hi-Power, and the <b>home-grown</b> Steyr Mannlicher entered the competition with the GB).|$|E
25|$|In July, {{they beat}} Super League rivals, Bradford, {{to reach the}} first Challenge Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium. Here, St Helens {{successfully}} defended their Challenge Cup by defeating Catalans Dragons 30-8 in the final on 25 August 2007. They were beaten in the Grand Final that year by Leeds by 33 points to 6, despite finishing {{at the top of}} the league ladder for the third successive season. James Roby, however, became the second St Helens player, and <b>home—grown</b> talent in two years to win the Man of Steel Award.|$|E
