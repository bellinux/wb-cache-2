40|$|The {{majority}} of the ~ 100 Holocene calderas on Earth host vigorously active hydrothermal systems, the heat and volatile budgets of which are sustained by degassing of deeply stored magma. Calderas may thus contribute a nontrivial, although poorly quantified, fraction of the global budget of magmatic volatiles such as CO 2. Here we use original isotopic a d petrological results from Campi Flegrei volcano, Italy, to propose that hydrothermal calcites are natural mineral archives for the magmatic CO 2 that reacted with reservoir rocks during the geological history of a caldera. We show that Campi Flegrei calcites, identified in core samples extracted from 3 -km-deep geothermal wells, formed at isotopic equilibrium with magmatic fluids having δ 18 OH 2 O of + 8. 7 ‰ to + 12. 7 ‰, and δ 13 CCO 2 of ~ - 1. 5 ‰. This inferred fossil fluid composition is virtually identical to that of present-day fumaroles, demonstratinga stable carbon source duringthe caldera's (< 40 k. y.) history. We use the mass of calcites stored in the hydrothermal system to estimate that 12 Gt of magmatic CO 2 reacted with the Campi Flegrei rocks during the caldera history; this corresponds to a time-averaged CO 2 flux of ~ 800 t d- 1. This long-term CO 2 flux, {{the first of its}} kind in the geological literature, is similar to the present-day soil CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> (1100 ± 200 t d- 1). We conclude that the actual magmatic CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> from calderas may be severely underestimated if subsurface calcite precipitation is not taken into account...|$|E

An unprecedented high-temporal-resolution (daily) sampling during July 2008 –August 2009 was conducted in the Longchuan River of the upper Yangtze basin, a subtropical monsoon river in China, to reveal the daily-to-seasonal dynamics of the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) and CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> from the river using Henry’s constant and CO 2 SYS. The pCO 2 levels ranged from 230 to 8300 μatm {{with an average of}} 1230 μatm and obvious daily and seasonal variations. More than 92 % samples were supersaturated with CO 2 in contrast to the atmospheric equilibrium (380 μatm). pCO 2 values in the river water in the wet season were relatively low, except in the flooding event in November, due to a dilution effect by heavy rainfall. In contrast, the pCO 2 levels in the dry season were much higher, due to lower pH resulted from anthropogenic activities. Net CO 2 degassing and pCO 2 were strongly correlated with dissolved nitrogen, but weakly with water temperature, dissolved inorganic carbon and water discharge, and uncorrelated with particulate nutrients and biogenic elements. The estimated water-to-air CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> in the Longchuan River was about 27 mol/m 2 /yr, with the upper limit of 50 mol/m 2 /yr. Our study also indicated that among the carbon remobilized from land to water, around 7 % (2800 t C/yr) of the total carbon was emitted to the atmosphere, 42 % (17, 000 t C/yr) deposited in the river-reservoirs system and 51 % (21, 000 t C/yr) exported further downstream.

30|$|We {{estimated}} the total CO 2 emissions {{from the main}} thermal manifestations of Furnas volcano by jointly using two different techniques: the GasFinder 2.0 tunable diode laser and the accumulation chamber method. We find that, in the most vigorously degassing areas, the soil CO 2 flux contribution (approximately 9.2  t day− 1) represents a minor (~ 18  %) contribution to the total CO 2 output, which {{is dominated by the}} fumaroles (about ~ 50  t day− 1). The CO 2 output contributed by the fumaroles is larger than that contributed by Furnas springs (~ 12  t day− 1, Cruz et al. 1999), but far lower than the total hydrothermal diffuse <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> (~ 968  t day− 1) at the scale of the entire volcano. This observation supports the conclusions that although fumaroles are the most visible surface manifestations of thermal activity, they are not necessarily the biggest contributors to the total CO 2 output from quiescent, Solfatara-stage volcanoes, where CO 2 is mainly released in silent, invisible form through soil emissions.|$|E
40|$|A cross-transplant {{experiment}} between estuarine {{water and}} seawater {{was conducted to}} examine the response of bacterial metabolic activity to riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) input under virus-rich and virus-free conditions, {{as well as to}} exogenous viruses. Riverine DOC input increased bacterial production significantly, but not bacterial respiration (BR) because of its high lability. The bioavailable riverine DOC influenced bulk bacterial respiration in two contrasting ways; it enhanced the bulk BR by stimulating bacterial growth, but simultaneously reduced the cell-specific BR due to its high lability. As a result, there was little stimulation of the bulk BR by riverine DOC. This might be partly responsible for lower CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>fluxes</b> in estuaries receiving high sewage-DOC that is highly labile. Viruses restricted microbial decomposition of riverine DOC dramatically by repressing the growth of metabolically active bacteria. Bacterial carbon demand in the presence of viruses only accounted for 7 – 12 % of that in the absence of viruses. Consequently, a large fraction of riverine DOC was likely transported offshore to the shelf. In addition, marine bacteria and estuarine bacteria responded distinctly to exogenous viruses. Marine viruses were able to infect estuarine bacteria, but not as efficiently as estuarine viruses, while estuarine viruses infected marine bacteria as efficiently as marine viruses. We speculate that the rapid changes in the viral community due to freshwater input destroyed the existing bacteria-virus relationship, which would change the bacteria...|$|R

This review summarises {{the current state of the}} field, starting with an analysis of what is, and what is not, known about the distribution of halogens in Earth’s interior reservoirs, and the principal controls on their behaviour during partial melting, crystallisation and degassing. With recent advances in measurement techniques, there is now a new opportunity to improve the inventories of halogen emissions from the open-vent, continuously-degassing systems that dominate the background contribution of volcanoes to the atmosphere. The different approaches to estimating the fluxes of HCl and HF to the atmosphere from arc and global volcanism are converging, and can now be used to place important constraints on the global cycling of halogens through subduction-zone systems. Arc-related volcanic emissions of halogens dominates the global halogen degassing budgets. Our current best estimates of halogen <b>degassing</b> <b>fluxes</b> from arc volcanoes are 4. 3 (± 1) Tg/a (HCl), 0. 5 (± 0. 2) Tg/a (HF), 5 – 15 Gg/a (HBr) and 0. 5 – 2 Gg/a (HI).

40|$|A Sr-Nd-Pb isotope {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out on sediments overlying the Cretaceous oceanic crust at ODP Leg 185 Site 1149 B. The sediments (biogenic carbonate and siliceous, clays) contain two horizons with high “excess” concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb. These horizons are both characterized by rare Earth element patterns that are concave-upwards and exhibit both negative Ce and positive Eu anomalies; comparable to those from modern hydrothermal plume particles and sediments. However, Pb isotope signatures differ significantly between the two metal-rich horizons. Metal-rich sediments in the lower part of Unit IV have Pb isotopes that lie on a mixing line between seawater and local oceanic crust end-members, which is consistent with a hydrothermal fall-out originating from a local oceanic spreading centre. In contrast, sediments from the upper part of Unit IV have much more radiogenic Pb isotope ratios, that cannot be related readily to local end-members (off-axis hydrothermal vent, clays, oceanic crust or large igneous provinces (LIP)). Their age-corrected Pb isotope compositions do, however, overlap with basalts from the Parana-Etendeka LIP. Evidence for related environmental effects include a drastic biotic change, higher oceanic ? 13 C values and more radiogenic seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. We estimate that the Parana-Etendeka LIP released ? 1 × 1019 g of carbon into the atmosphere as CO 2, corresponding to Pb and S <b>degassing</b> <b>fluxes</b> of ? 1 × 109 g a? 1 and ? 15 × 1012 g a? 1, respectively.

However, both daily and monthly minimal and maximal p CO 2 also occurred in this period. In contrast, the p CO 2 levels in the dry season were much higher, mainly resulted from lower pH by anthropogenic activities.

40|$|Objective: This project {{seeks to}} improve the {{application}} of noble gas isotope studies to multiphase fluid processes in the Earth's crust by (1) identifying the important noble gas carrier phases in sediments to address the processes {{that have led to}} the observed enrichment and depletion patterns in sedimentary rocks and fluids, (2) examine the mechanisms by which such noble gas patterns are acquired, trapped and subsequently released to mobile crustal fluids, and (3) evaluate the time and length scales for the transport of noble gas components, such as radiogenic 4 He, through the continental crust [...] Project Description: Sedimentary rocks and oil field gases typically are enriched in heavy noble gases: Xe/Ar ratios of ~ 10 - 10, 000 times the ratio in air have been observed that cannot be explained by adsorption hypotheses. Laboratory experiments designed to isolate sedimentary phases for noble gas analysis are conducted to identify the carrier phase(s). It has been observed that radiogenic 4 He accumulates in confined aquifer waters at rates that exceed the rate of local production and approaching the whole crustal production rate. A literature evaluation of 4 He, 3 He crustal fluxes is being conducted to evaluate crustal scale mass transport in terms of the rate, mechanisms, temporal and spatial variability and the role played by tectonic processes. Results: The laboratory study has concentrated on noble gas abundances in a variety of sedimentary silica samples. We have found that, in general, samples of inorganic silica have noble gas abundances that are consistent with occlusion of air-saturated water in fluid inclusions and lack requisite enrichment/depletion factors needed to explain the noble gas inventory in oil field fluids. However, numerous replicate analyses of noble gases extracted from silica spicules from live sponges (Calyxnicaeensis) show significantly enriched Ar, Kr, and Xe concentrations ([iNg]sample/[iNg]asw > 1), but with very little if any mass dependence in the acquisition and trapping of Ar, Kr and Xe. Noble gases in silica samples from the (diatomaceous) Monterey Formation (Elk Hills oil field, CA) and an Atlantic box core were found to be somewhat depleted with respect to the sponge spicule, fractionated in a fashion favoring the heavy noble gases, and approach the compositions that have been observed in bulk deep sea sediments. We suspect that the differences in noble gas absolute and relative abundances between the sponge spicule samples and the more evolved diatomaceous samples are related to either (1) fundamental differences in the biologically controlled mineralization or (2) postdepositional effects related to the progressive crystallization of amorphous silica (e. g. opal-A) to more ordered structures. Laboratory cultured diatoms and box core sea sediment samples collected as a function of depth within the sediment column have been processed for analysis of the silica phases to address these questions. Through a statistical evaluation using a global data base covering many geologic environments, we have determined that the log normal mean of the radiogenic 4 He flux across the Earthâs continental crust is 4. 18 x 1010 4 He atoms m- 2 s- 1. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} range of the continental 4 He <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> increases with decreasing time and space scales. The statistics can be interpreted as reflecting natural variability and suggest that the mechanisms transporting the crustal helium <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> contain a high degree of both spatial and temporal variability. This estimate of the log normal mean of the continental <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> of 4 He is approximately equivalent to the radiogenic production rate for 4 He in the whole crust. Large scale vertical mass transport in continental crust is estimated as scaled values of the order 10 - 5 cm 2 s- 1 for helium (over 2 Byr and 40 km vertically) vs. 10 - 2 cm 2 s- 1 for heat. This rate of mass transport requires not only release of He from the solid phase via diffusion, fracturing or comminution; but also an enhanced rate of mass transport facilitated by some degree of fluid advection. This further implies a separation of heat and mass during transport...|$|E

These values are comparable to other tropical reservoirs. Moreover, <b>degassing</b> <b>fluxes</b> at the outlet of the powerhouse downstream of the turbines were very low.

40|$|Helium {{isotopes}} (3 He, 4 He) {{are useful}} tracers for investigating the deep ocean circulation and for evaluating ocean general circulation models, because helium is {{a stable and}} conservative nuclide that does not take part in any chemical or biological process.

We present the first simulation of the terrigenic helium isotope distribution in the whole Mediterranean Sea using a high-resolution model (NEMO-MED 12). For this simulation we build a simple source function for terrigenic helium isotopes based on published estimates of terrestrial helium fluxes.

40|$|This thesis evaluates {{potential}} {{pathways to}} constrain {{the evolution of}} metamorphic CO 2, using the observation that significant CO 2 fluxes have been noted from hot springs above active metamorphic belts. Theoretical constraints on CO 2 behaviour are assessed using available observations and experimental data literature. Metamorphic decarbonation, fluid immiscibility, groundwater mixing, boiling, and phase separation (CO 2 (aq) = CO 2 (g)) are modelled theoretically, chiefly using water chemistry and isotopic constrains on CO 2 evolution. Measured carbon isotope compositions for spring fluids in the Marsyandi and Trisuli Valley in Nepal reach + 13 ‰, while coexisting free gas-phase compositions are close to - 4 ‰. The considerable variation between gas and liquid isotopic compositions constrains the possible fractionation pathways by the necessity to satisfy mass balance. The large isotopic variation between liquid and complementary gas phase suggests that degassing from some springs is quantitative and requires up to 99 % CO 2 loss from solution. Noble gas systematics from effervescing springs in the Marsyandi provide evidence consistent with quantitative degassing, although a lack of data precludes a more detailed appraisal. No mantle noble gas signature is detected in Marsyandi or Trisuli springs attesting to a dominant metamorphic origin of CO 2 (atmospheric and organic CO 2 excepted). Existing petrological methods for the orogen-wide determination of metamorphic CO 2 liberation from the Himalaya are examined and advanced using the study of calc-silicates. Extrapolation of geochemically derived hot spring fluxes, assuming a minimum of ~ 99 % degassing of CO 2 from hot spring waters, implies a CO 2 flux between 0. 6 and 1. 5 x 10 12 mol yr - 1, consistent with estimations {{made on the basis}} of petrology.

CH 4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a per molecule basis over a 100 -year time horizon.

In recent years, significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from tropical, boreal, and mid-latitude reservoirs have been reported. At a time when hydropower is increasing worldwide, better understanding of seasonal and regional variation in GHG emissions is needed in order to develop a predictive understanding of such fluxes within man-made impoundments. We examined power-producing dam complexes within xeric temperate locations in the northwestern United States. Sampling environments on the Snake (Lower Monumental Dam Complex) and Columbia Rivers (Priest Rapids Dam Complex) included tributary, mainstem, embayment, forebay, and tailrace areas during winter and summer 2012. At each sampling location, GHG measurement pathways included surface gas <b>flux,</b> <b>degassing</b> as water passed through dams during power generation, ebullition within littoral embayments, and direct sampling of hyporheic pore-water. Measurements were also carried out in a free-flowing reach of the Columbia River to estimate unaltered conditions. Surface flux resulted in very low emissions, with reservoirs acting as a sink for CO 2 (up to – 262 mg m- 2 d- 1, which is within the range previously reported for similarly located reservoirs). Surface flux of methane remained below 1 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1, a value well below fluxes reported previously for temperate reservoirs. Water passing through hydroelectric projects acted as a sink for CO 2 during winter and a small source during summer, with mean <b>degassing</b> <b>fluxes</b> of – 117 and 4. 5 t CO 2 d- 1, respectively. Degassing of CH 4 was minimal, with mean fluxes of 3. 1 × 10 - 6 and – 5. 6 × 10 - 4 t CH 4 d- 1 during winter and summer, respectively. Gas flux due to ebullition was greater in coves located within reservoirs than in coves within the free flowing Hanford Reach–and CH 4 flux exceeded that of CO 2. Methane emissions varied widely across sampling locations, ranging from 10. 5 to 1039 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1, with mean fluxes of 324 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 in Lower Monumental Dam reservoir and 482 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 in the Priest Rapids Dam reservoir. The magnitude of methane flux due to ebullition was unexpectedly high, and falls within the range recently reported for other temperate reservoirs around the world, further suggesting that this methane source should be considered in estimates of global greenhouse gas emissions. Methane flux from sediment pore-water within littoral embayments averaged 4. 2 mg m- 2 d- 1 during winter and 8. 1 mg m- 2 d- 1 during summer, with a peak flux of 19. 8 mg m- 2 d- 1 (at the same location where CH 4 ebullition was also the greatest). Carbon dioxide flux from sediment pore-water averaged approximately 80 mg m- 2 d- 1 with little difference between winter and summer.

The 4 He accumulation rate ranges from 6. 8 × 10 − 10 (for the in situ accumulation rate) to 7. 0 × 10 − 9 (ccSTP/(gwater · a) considering both 4 He in situ production and the <b>degassing</b> <b>flux,</b> assuming 4 He is accumulated constantly in groundwater. By comparing the subsurface 36 Cl increase with 4 He concentrations in groundwater, the 4 He accumulation rate was determined from data for groundwater arriving at the secular equilibrium of 36 Cl/Cl. The 4 He accumulation rate was found to be (1. 83 ± 0. 72) × 10 − 8 ccSTP/(gwater · a) without determining the magnitude of degassing 4 He flux...|$|E
40|$|We have {{simulated}} the {{steady-state distribution}} of helium {{in the deep}} sea to investigate the magnitude and spatial and temporal variability of mantle degassing and to characterize deep-sea circulation and ventilation. The simulation was produced by linking a simple source function for helium injected at mid-ocean ridges with an oceanic general circulation model (GCM). By assuming that the flux of mantle helium is linearly proportional to the seafloor spreading rate and by using previous estimates for the total flux of mantle helium into the oceans, the GCM yields an oceanic ^ 3 He distribution which is in qualitative agreement with observations both in overall magnitude and in general distribution. This provides new evidence that the flux of mantle ^ 3 He into the oceans is about 1000 mol/yr and that mid-ocean ridges are the dominant source of mantle helium. Although the match with observations is good in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the simulated ^ 3 He anomalies throughout the Atlantic Ocean are much higher than has been measured. Because the GCM is thought to reproduce Atlantic circulation reasonably well, this discrepancy suggests an error in the helium source function. Either helium injection is not a linear function of seafloor emplacement rate, or eruption and concomitant degassing are highly episodic at the slow spreading rates characteristic of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The latter explanation would imply minimal volcanic activity along {{the entire length of}} the MAR over the last few centuries. In addition to constraints on the <b>degassing</b> <b>flux,</b> our work provides information on the transport and ventilation of deep ocean waters and constrains the degree to which current GCMs can reproduce deep-water circulation patterns. While the results generally support the GCM's abyssal circulation, our simulation reveals regions of overly-intense lateral diffusion and upwelling in the model, particularly in the equatorial Pacific. Similarly, there appears to be insufficient production of He-ventilated bottom waters in the model Antarctic. These observations suggest that further refinement of the GCM abyssal circulation is required...|$|E
40|$|The {{incomplete}} spatial {{coverage of}} CO 2 partial pressure (p CO 2) measurements across estuary types represents a significant knowledge gap in current regional- and global-scale estimates of estuarine CO 2 emissions. Given the limited research on CO 2 dynamics in large estuaries and bay systems, {{as well as}} the sources of error in the calculation of p CO 2 (carbonic acid dissociation constants, organic alkalinity), estimates of air–sea CO 2 fluxes in estuaries are subject to large uncertainties. The Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) at the lower limit of the subarctic region in eastern Canada is the world's largest estuarine system, and is characterized by an exceptional richness in environmental diversity. It is among the world's most intensively studied estuaries, yet there are no published data on its surface-water p CO 2 distribution. To fill this data gap, a comprehensive dataset was compiled from direct and indirect measurements of carbonate system parameters in the surface waters of the EGSL during the spring or summer of 2003 – 2016. The calculated surface-water p CO 2 ranged from 435 to 765  µatm in the shallow partially mixed upper estuary, 139 – 578  µatm in the deep stratified lower estuary, and 207 – 478  µatm along the Laurentian Channel in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Overall, at the time of sampling, the St. Lawrence Estuary served as a very weak source of CO 2 to the atmosphere, with an area-averaged CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>flux</b> of 0. 98 to 2. 02  mmol C m − 2  d − 1 (0. 36 to 0. 74  mol C m − 2  yr − 1). A preliminary analysis revealed that respiration (upper estuary), photosynthesis (lower estuary), and temperature (Gulf of St. Lawrence) controlled the spatial variability in surface-water p CO 2. Whereas we used the dissociation constants of Cai and Wang (1998) to calculate estuarine p CO 2, formulations recommended for best practices in open ocean environments may underestimate p CO 2 at low salinities, while those of Millero (2010) may result in overestimates...|$|E

We present new geophysical constraints on the shallow feeding system of Etna volcano derived from array analysis of infrasound radiated from two distinct sources, one located in the SE crater {{and one in the}} Voragine or NE crater (VNE). These two sources alternated in their behavior, with the VNE crater system radiating low amplitude background infrasound interrupted by episodes of increased infrasound radiation from the SE crater. This switching behavior suggested a branched shallow feeding system strongly controlled by the gas/magma-flux. Here, the VNE craters represented the preferential and most stable branch of <b>degassing</b> during stationary <b>flux</b> regime, while the SE crater branch activated in response to an increase in the magma/gas supply rate...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the role}} of rivers as a {{significant}} methane source to coastal waters and the atmosphere has previously focused on tropical regions. This study attempted to understand the spatial and temporal variability of methane within a dammed temperate river system in northern Germany, and the river's methane contribution to the atmosphere and coastal waters. Dissolved methane and dissolved oxygen were routinely sampled from the dam to 3. 2 km upstream. The sediment pore water methane was measured, as well as the atmospheric methane flux from the river. A 22 hour study was performed to understand the diurnal variability of methane in the river. To determine the spatial variability of methane in the Brackish Discharge Zone, the water column and pore water were analyzed for methane concentration. Methane concentrations in the river were supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere, reaching concentrations between 311 - 2257 ± 51 nM and saturation ratios (R) from 62 - 451. It appeared that methane concentrations increased downstream as a result of methane accumulating from runoff. Precipitation-induced runoff and dam opening were found to be the dominant factors affecting the overall river temporal methane variability. The dam outlet caused a significant <b>degassing</b> methane <b>flux,</b> from 5 - 25 % of the methane concentration immediately before the dam. In coastal waters near the dam, the river was the dominant methane source, contributing 2. 1 - 4. 5 kg of methane per day. This study suggests temperate rivers, especially those which are dammed, may need to be considered when constraining coastal and atmospheric methane budget...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCO 2 stable carbon {{isotopes}} {{are very}} attractive in environmental research to investigate {{both natural and}} an-thropogenic carbon sources. Laser-based CO 2 carbon isotope analysis provides continuous measurement at high temporal resolution and is a promising alternative to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We performed a thorough assessment of a commercially available CO 2 Carbon Isotope Analyser (CCIA DLT- 100, Los Gatos Research) that allows in situ measurement of δ 13 C in CO 2. Using a set of reference gases of known CO 2 concentration and carbon isotopic composition, we evaluated the precision, long-term stability, temperature sensitivity and concentration dependence of the analyser. Despite good precision calculated from Allan variance (5. 0 ppm for CO 2 concentration, and 0. 05 h for δ 13 C at 60 s averaging), real performances are altered by two main sources of error: temperature sensitivity and dependence of δ 13 C on CO 2 concentration. Data processing is required to correct for these errors. Following application of these corrections, we achieve an accuracy of 8. 7 ppm for CO 2 concentration and 1. 3 h for δ 13 C, which is worse compared to mass spectrometry performance, but still allowing field applications. With this portable analyser we measured CO 2 <b>flux</b> <b>degassed</b> from rock in an underground tunnel. The obtained carbon isotopic composition agrees with IRMS measurement, {{and can be used}} to identify the carbon source. S. Guillon () · E. Pili CEA, DAM...|$|R
40|$|On 27 February 2007, a new {{eruption}} {{occurred on}} Stromboli which lasted until 2 April. It {{was characterized by}} effusive activity on the Sciara del Fuoco and by a paroxysmal event (15 March). This crisis represented an {{opportunity for us to}} refine the model that had been developed previously (2002 – 2003 eruption) and to improve our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} magmatic dynamics of the volcano and the geochemical variations in the fluids. In particular, the evaluation of the dynamic equilibrium between the volatiles (CO 2 and SO 2) released from the magma and the corresponding fluids discharged from the summit area allowed us to evaluate the level of criticality of the volcanic activity. One of the major accomplishments of this study is a 4 -year database of summit soil CO 2 flux on the basis of which we define the thresholds (low–medium–high) for this parameter that are empirically based on the natural volcanological evolution of Stromboli. The SO 2 <b>fluxes</b> of the <b>degassing</b> plume and the CO 2 fluxes emitted from the soil at Pizzo Sopra la Fossa are also presented. It is noteworthy that geochemical signals of volcanic unrest have been clearly identified before, during and after the effusive activity. These signals were found almost simultaneously in the degassing plume (SO 2 flux) and in soil <b>degassing</b> (CO 2 <b>flux)</b> at the summit, although the two degassing processes are shown to be clearly different. The interpretation of the results will be useful for future volcanic surveillance at Stromboli...|$|R
40|$|Herein, {{we present}} {{and discuss the}} result of 148 {{measurements}} of soil CO 2 flux performed {{for the first time}} in Linosa island (Sicily Channel, Italy), a Plio-Pleistocene volcanic complex no longer active but still of in-terest owing to its location within a seismically active portion of the Sicily Channel rift system. The main purpose of this survey was to assess the occurrence of CO 2 soil <b>degassing,</b> and compare <b>flux</b> estimations from this island with data of soil degassing from worldwide active volcanic as well as non-volcanic areas. To this aim soil CO 2 fluxes were measured over a surface of about 4. 2 km 2 covering ~ 80 % of the island. The soil CO 2 de-gassing was observed to be mainly concentrated in the eastern part of the island likely due to volcano-tectonic lineaments, the presence of which is in good agreement with the known predominant regional faults system. Then, the collected data were interpreted using sequential Gaussian sim-ulation that allowed estimating the total CO 2 emissions of the island. Results show low levels of CO 2 emissions from the soil of the island (~ 55 ton d- 1) compared with CO 2 emissions of currently active volcanic areas, such as Miyakejima (Japan) and Vulcano (Italy). Results from this study suggest that soil degassing in Linosa is mainly fed by superficial organic activity with a moderate contribution of a deep CO 2 likely driven by NW-SE trending active tectonic structures in the eastern part of the island. 1...|$|R
40|$|Short-lived uranium-series isotope {{data from}} rocks erupted under {{explosive}} and effusive regimes are presented {{and used to}} provide constraints on the timescales of magmatic <b>degassing</b> and volatile <b>fluxing</b> during the 1999 and 2000 AD eruption of Mt. Cameroon. In contrast to the relatively homogenous major and trace element data of the analysed rocks, volcanic rocks from Mt. Cameroon reveal a spread of ²³⁰Th-²²⁶Ra isotope data. Volcanic rocks erupted along the southwest rift in 1999 have (²²⁶Ra/²³⁰Th) ratios of ~ 1. 25, whereas rocks erupted more axially in 2000 have relatively low (²²⁶Ra/²³⁰Th) ratios of 1. 09 - 1. 2 and concomitant low Ba/Th ratios. These differences imply separate magma chamber systems and probably reflect differences in the concentrations of water within the primary magmas, which led to different amounts of amphibole fractionation at depth. Variations in the (²¹⁰Pb/²²⁶Ra) 0 ratios are used to track degassing or volatile accumulation within the magma system. The near equilibrium (²¹⁰Pb/²²⁶Ra) values for effusively erupted rocks from Mt. Cameroon suggest that this magma resided for more than several decades and less than a few thousand years before it erupted. The small excesses of ²¹⁰Pb over ²²⁶Ra in some samples indicate that some of this magma was fluxed by a Rn-bearing gaseous phase for weeks to years before the eruption. In contrast, most explosively erupted rocks from Mt. Cameroon have deficits of ²¹⁰Pb relative to ²²⁶Ra that require years to decades of degassing before eruption. We suggest that the magmas erupted as scoria at Mt. Cameroon degassed as they rose from lithospheric depths. Deep degassing was CO₂-dominated, whereas shallower magma degassing involved more water and crystallisation of an anhydrous mineral assemblage. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A new box {{model for}} the global carbon-calcium-strontium cycle is {{developed}} to simulate the evolution of Cretaceous and Cenozoic seawater and atmosphere. The model accounts for carbon masses in ocean and atmosphere, in carbonate, in particulate organic carbon (POC), and in the mantle. Major processes considered in the model are mantle <b>degassing</b> and hydrothermal <b>fluxes,</b> alteration of oceanic crust, chemical weathering, metamorphism of carbonates, carbonate accumulation, carbonate turnover in subduction zones, and the turnover of POC. Model outputs are partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2), seawater pH, concentrations of Ca, Sr, and HCO 3 in seawater {{as well as the}} C and Sr isotopic composition of seawater and marine carbonates. A comprehensive review of current fluxes is given to define the flux equations and parameters. Secular trends recorded in marine carbonates are used to constrain the remaining open model parameters. The model includes a new parameterization of silicate weathering considering the contribution of young volcanic deposits. The weathering of these deposits consumes a large fraction of volcanically-released CO 2 and maintains moderate pCO 2 levels during periods of intense mantle degassing and volcanic/tectonic activity. Further negative feed-back is provided by POC burial which is coupled to pCO 2 -dependent weathering rates. The model produces high Ca concentrations during the Cretaceous and a strong increase in both pH and carbonate alkalinity during the late Cenozoic. Moreover, it predicts high atmospheric CO 2 and surface temperatures for the mid-Cretaceous and early Cenozoic and low values for the late Cenozoic icehouse world thus suggesting a close coupling between climate and pCO 2. Finally, it demonstrates that the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse was caused by enhanced volcanic/tectonic activity and confirms that the late Cenozoic cooling has been induced by an increase in silicate weatherability caused by enhanced mountain building and erosion...|$|R
40|$|The ‘COPSE’ (Carbon, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulphur and Evolution) {{biogeochemical}} model {{predicts the}} coupled histories and controls on atmospheric O₂, CO₂ and ocean composition over Phanerozoic time. The forwards modelling approach utilized in COPSE {{makes it a}} useful tool for testing mechanistic hypotheses against geochemical data and it has been extended and altered a number of times since being published in 2004. Here we undertake a wholesale revision of the model, incorporating: (1) elaboration and updating of the external forcing factors; (2) improved representation of existing processes, including plant effects on weathering and ocean anoxia; (3) inclusion of additional processes and tracers, including seafloor weathering, volcanic rock weathering and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr; (4) updating of the present-day baseline fluxes; and (5) a more efficient and robust numerical scheme. A key aim is to explore how sensitive predictions of atmospheric CO₂, O₂ and ocean composition are to model updates and ongoing uncertainties. The revised model reasonably captures the long-term trends in Phanerozoic geochemical proxies for atmospheric pCO₂, pO₂, ocean [SO₄], carbonate δ¹³C, sulphate δ³⁴S and carbonate ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr. It predicts a two-phase drawdown of atmospheric CO₂ with the rise of land plants and associated cooling phases in the Late Ordovician and Devonian-early Carboniferous, followed by broad peaks of atmospheric CO₂ and temperature in the Triassic and mid-Cretaceous – although some of the structure in the CO₂ proxy record is missed. The model robustly predicts a mid-Paleozoic oxygenation event due to the earliest land plants, with OO₂ rising from ~ 5 % to > 17 % of the atmosphere and oxygenating the ocean. Thereafter, atmospheric O₂ is effectively regulated with remaining fluctuations being a Carboniferous–Permian O₂ peak ~ 26 % linked to burial of terrestrial organic matter in coal swamps, a Triassic–Jurassic O₂ minimum ~ 21 % linked to low uplift, a Cretaceous O₂ peak ~ 26 % linked to high <b>degassing</b> and weathering <b>fluxes,</b> and a Cenozoic O₂ decline...|$|R
40|$|The Azores {{archipelago}} {{is composed}} of nine volcanic islands located at the triple junction between the North American, Eurasian, and Nubian plates. Nowadays the volcanic activity in the archipelago {{is characterized by the}} presence of secondary manifestations of volcanism, such as hydrothermal fumaroles, thermal and cold CO 2 -rich springs as well as soil diffuse degassing areas, and low magnitude seismicity. Soil CO 2 <b>degassing</b> (concentration and <b>flux)</b> surveys have been performed at Pico, Faial, and São Jorge islands to identify possible diffuse degassing structures. Since the settlement of the Azores in the fifteenth Century these three islands were affected by seven onshore volcanic eruptions and at least six destructive earthquakes. These islands are crossed by numerous active tectonic structures with dominant WNW-ESE direction, and less abundant conjugate NNW-SSE trending faults. A total of 2, 855 soil CO 2 concentration measurements have been carried out with values varying from 0 to 20. 7 vol. %. Soil CO 2 flux measurements, using the accumulation chamber method, have also been performed at Pico and Faial islands in the summer of 2011 and values varied from absence of CO 2 to 339 g m− 2 d− 1. The highest CO 2 emissions were recorded at Faial Island and were associated with the Pedro Miguel graben faults, which seem to control the CO 2 diffuse degassing and were interpreted as the pathways for the CO 2 ascending from deep reservoirs to the surface. At São Jorge Island, four main degassing zones have been identified at the intersection of faults or associated to WNW-ESE tectonic structures. Four diffuse degassing structures were identified at Pico Island essentially where different faults intersect. Pico geomorphology is dominated by a 2, 351 m high central volcano that presents several steam emissions at its summit. These emissions are located along a NW-SE fault and the highest measured soil CO 2 concentration reached 7. 6 vol. % with a maximum temperature of 77 °C. The diffuse degassing maps show that anomalous CO 2 degassing areas are controlled essentially by the tectonic structures and the lithology of the sites since the youngest volcanic systems are characterized by very low CO 2 emissions...|$|R
