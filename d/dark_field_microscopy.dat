25|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscopy</b> is a {{technique}} for improving the contrast of unstained, transparent specimens. Dark field illumination uses a carefully aligned light source to minimize the quantity of directly transmitted (unscattered) light entering the image plane, collecting only the light scattered by the sample. Dark field can dramatically improve image contrast – especially of transparent objects – while requiring little equipment setup or sample preparation. However, the technique suffers from low light intensity in final image of many biological samples {{and continues to be}} affected by low apparent resolution.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{diagnose}} meningeal syphilis. One {{of the most}} common ways include visualizing the organisms by immunofluorescence and <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscopy.</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscopy</b> initially had the finding that the spirochete has a corkscrew appearance and that it is spirillar and gram (-) bacteria. Another method would also be through the screening test and serology. Serology includes two types of antibody test: Nontreponemal antibody test and Treponemal antibody test (specific test). The Nontreponemal antibody test screens with VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Lab) and RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin). The Treponemal antibody test (specific test) confirms with FTA-ABS (Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption). Brain imaging and MRI scans may be used when diagnosing patients; however, they do not prove to be as effective as specific tests. Specific tests for treponemal antibody are typically more expensive because the earliest anitbodies bind to spirochetes. These tests are usually more specific and remain positive in patients with other treponemal diseases.|$|E
