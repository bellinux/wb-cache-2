He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his <b>exhibitions</b> <b>in</b> London (1862) and Berlin (1865).

5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} {{materials for the}} painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878.

5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major <b>exhibitions</b> <b>in</b> 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
