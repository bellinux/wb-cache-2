Another person was injured during the magnitude 6.0 (Mw) aftershock of 12 April. In a report from July 2011, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed a death toll of four from the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|St Michael's Church was {{destroyed}} by an earthquake on 11 September 1275. According to the British Geological Survey, the earthquake was felt in London, Canterbury and Wales, and {{was reported to have}} destroyed many houses and churches in England. The force was greater than 7MSK, with its <b>epicentre</b> in the area around Portsmouth or Chichester, South England.|$|E

5|$|The great Sicilian {{earthquake}} of 1693 destroyed {{at least}} 45 towns and cities, affecting {{an area of}} 5600 square kilometres and causing the deaths of about 60,000 people. The <b>epicentre</b> of the disaster was offshore, although the exact position remains unknown. Towns which suffered severely were Ragusa, Modica, Scicli, and Ispica. Rebuilding began almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its <b>epicentre.</b> The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{territory}} of Chile is subject to earthquakes, arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. The subduction zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Some earthquakes which occurred near the <b>epicentre</b> of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|On October 27, 2012, an {{earthquake}} of magnitude 7.7 (the strongest earthquake in Canada since the 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake) was <b>epicentred</b> {{at a depth}} of 17.5 km under the island.|$|R

40|$|A {{temporary}} seismometer-array station such {{as described}} by Miyamura et al. (1961) was established at Tochimoto and at Tsukuba to investigate the micro-earthquakes occurring in the Kanto and Chubu region. The principal purposes of the present investigation are 1) to find the accuracy of hypocentre determination by the seismometer-array method, 2) to locate the zones of micro-earthquakes in the Kanto and Chubu region and 3) to learn something about {{the structure of the}} crust and upper mantle in this region. The <b>epicentres</b> determined independently by the Tsukuba station and by the Tochimoto station are shown in Fig. 9 a and Fig. 9 b respectively. It is remarkable that many earthquakes in the Western Kanto and Chubu region occur in the crust, while those in East Kanto occur mostly in the upper mantle. Fig. 10 shows the <b>epicentres</b> of 14 shocks for which both stations could give good determinations of them. There is a systematic divergence between the <b>epicentres</b> determined independently at the two stations. This divergence may be explained if the velocity in the upper mantle increases seaward...|$|R
5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust {{earthquake that}} occurred on 26 December 2004, with an <b>epicentre</b> off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal fringes of the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E
5|$|The Fukushima Hamadōri {{earthquake}} was {{succeeded by}} a number of smaller tremors; that same day, at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude3.5 Mj or higher were recorded near its <b>epicentre.</b> Of the series, the strongest registered at a magnitude of 5.5 Mj and occurred within 3.5hours after the initial quake. A shallow magnitude 6.0 Mw (6.4 Mj) earthquake and several smaller tremors struck the region on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was especially}} destructive in the <b>epicentre</b> town, Pichilemu, capital of Cardenal Caro Province. The city hosts five National Monuments of Chile, of which two, the Agustín Ross Park and the Agustín Ross Cultural Centre, were seriously {{damaged by the}} earthquake. It also damaged the villages of La Aguada and Cardonal de Panilonco. Rancagua, the capital of O'Higgins Region, was also damaged, leading President Sebastián Piñera to declare a catastrophe state in O'Higgins Region.|$|E
40|$|Summary. A {{composite}} {{fault plane}} solution of aftershocks of the 4. 8 ML Carlisle earthquake of 1979 December 26, and the geographic distribution of their <b>epicentres,</b> indicate {{the predominance of}} right-lateral strike-slip focal mechanisms, with a significant component of dip-slip faulting, on a NW-SE trending fault zone. Data presented here, combined with an alternative inter-pretation of the published results of King, closely constrain the possible fit of nodal planes. The strike of the NM-SE nodal plane is in excellent agreement with a trend in aftershock <b>epicentres.</b> The aftershock zone {{is close to the}} edge of a long positive NW-SE trending gravity anomaly.

5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the <b>epicentre</b> of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was {{generally considered to be}} both just and fair.|$|E

5|$|Sophiatown , {{also known}} as Sof'town or Kofifi, is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Sophiatown was a legendary black {{cultural}} hub that was destroyed under apartheid, rebuilt {{under the name of}} Triomf, and in 2006 officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of the excesses of South Africa under apartheid. Despite the violence and poverty, it was the <b>epicentre</b> of politics, jazz and blues during the 1940s and 1950s. It produced some of South Africa's most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 Bellamy {{became the}} observatory's {{seismology}} assistant. She operated seismographs, managing correspondence {{with up to}} six hundred seismograph stations, and collated the data to be analysed. After Turner, or, from 1923, a new assistant called Joseph Hughes, had computed the <b>epicentres</b> of earthquakes, she prepared the results for publication in the International Seismological Summary (ISS). Moreover, she computed the <b>epicentres</b> herself for six issues during the Second World War while Hughes was serving in the armed forces. In this post she worked in an unheated hut until 1927, which caused her discomfort {{in addition to her}} generally poor health. In 1930, the year of Turner's death, she became the editor of the ISS; in his memory, she voluntarily produced an index of <b>epicentres</b> for 1925 - 1935 and a map of the world showing their locations. Between 1913 and 1939 she published nine papers, including two with her uncle. Her uncle died in 1936 and despite their long partnership her uncle left a valuable collection to Cambridge University and surprisingly he left no money. Ethel's finances were helped when Cambridge University refused her uncle's bequest so that it could be sold.|$|R
25|$|Earthquakes with <b>epicentres</b> in or {{near the}} suburb of Frankston have {{occurred}} in 1932, 1978, 1980, 2009 and 2014. The most recent, on 15 March 2014, measured 2.2 on the Richter magnitude scale. The largest, on 22 September 2009, measured 3.0 on the Richter scale.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the 1957 Fethiye {{earthquakes}} occurred on April 24, 1957, with the second and larger event about seven hours later on the following day.

5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest man. When {{he returned to}} Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an <b>epicentre</b> of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E
5|$|In 499 BC, {{the tyrant}} of Miletus, Aristagoras, {{embarked}} on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos, with Persian support; however, the expedition was a debacle and, pre-empting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians. This {{was the beginning of}} the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the <b>epicentre</b> of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this disastrous expedition, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against Darius the Great. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect, before the Persians regrouped and made straight for the <b>epicentre</b> of the rebellion at Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Persians decisively defeated the Ionian fleet and effectively ended the rebellion. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria, who had supported the revolt. In 492 BC therefore, the first Persian invasion of Greece, would begin {{as a consequence of}} the failed attack on Naxos, and the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

50|$|The epicentral region saw {{dozens of}} {{significant}} aftershocks following the main earthquake. The strongest, which hit at 19:47 CEST on 7 April, measured magnitude 5.3 ML and caused further damage.

5|$|The Ionian Revolt was {{triggered}} by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, {{in an attempt to}} bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the <b>epicentre</b> of the rebellion at Miletus.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. It affected roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated to have experienced at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an elderly man had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck. Mass casualties were avoided owing to a combination of building evacuations prompted by the weaker shock and an <b>epicentre</b> removed from populous areas.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{suffered}} incursions from Mughals {{towards the}} end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with Mecca and Basra. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in 1853. The city became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century and was the <b>epicentre</b> of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946. After India's independence in 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State.|$|E

40|$|In 2010, {{the first}} {{outbreak}} of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Greece was recorded, {{the largest in}} Europe since 1996. After 2010, outbreaks continued to occur in {{different areas of the}} country. Enhanced surveillance was implemented during transmission periods (June to October). We investigated the 2012 outbreak to determine its extent and identify risk factors for severe disease using regression models. Of 161 cases recorded in 2012, 109 had neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Two outbreak <b>epicentres</b> were identified: the southern suburbs of Athens in July and a rural area in East Macedonia &Thrace in August-September. The case fatality rate of the WNND cases was 17 % (18 / 109). A lower case fatality rate was recorded in the two <b>epicentres</b> (7 % (2 / 28) and 9 % (4 / 46)) : the higher case fatality outside the two <b>epicentres</b> might reflect a diagnostic bias. Age above 74 years (adjusted risk ratio (RR) : 7. 0; 95 % CI: 2. 2 - 22) and chronic renal failure (adjusted RR: 4. 5; 95 % CI: 2. 7 - 7. 5) were independently associated with WNND-related death. In three PCR-positive samples, sequencing revealed WNV lineage 2 identical to the 2010 strain. The occurrence of human cases in three consecutive years suggests that WNV lineage 2 has become established in Greece. Raising awareness among physicians and susceptible populations (elderly people and persons with comorbidities) throughout Greece is critical to reduce the disease impact...|$|R
