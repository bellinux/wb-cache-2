The aim of the thesis was to write software for controlling the <b>high-voltage</b> <b>generator.</b> With this software user can input the voltage over time and carries out experiments via a graphical user interface on the PC in an intuitive way. The software includes computer application with a graphical user interface (GUI) written in the programming language C # and a program for the microcontroller STM 32 f 103 RB in the <b>high-voltage</b> <b>generator,</b> written in C programming language. For {{the connection between the}} two, we implemented a protocol that works in the form of sending and receiving transmission packages via a serial interface. The software allows user to input desired voltage function directly on the output or in the internal memory of the high voltage generator. If the output is set, the actual course of the voltage output over time is simultaneously drawn on the GUI. Hence the user can see the difference between the desired and actual output function. The microcontroller is the main electronic component of the <b>high-voltage</b> <b>generator,</b> which is responsible for the overall functionality. Microcontroller program accepts transmission packages through the serial port, and handels them appropriately.
