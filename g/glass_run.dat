50|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> {{channel is}} a groove, {{normally}} made of rubber or plastic, that is found around windows (most commonly car windows). The {{primary purpose of}} a <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> channel {{is to provide a}} seal for the window.|$|E

They feature a number of security features, including a 13 mm explosive resistant steel plate underneath the body, titanium and Kevlar lined cabins, armoured windows with bullet resistant polycarbonate toughened <b>glass,</b> <b>run</b> flat tyres and 'gun ports' to enable bodyguards to return fire at any attackers.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has wavy <b>glass</b> <b>runs</b> along the west-facing York Way frontage; this three-layered glass façade is a free-standing transparent surface {{made up of}} hundreds of very slightly curved sheets of glass. As well as reducing heat gain from the afternoon sun, the glass wall provides Kings Place with a distinctive facade.|$|R

50|$|On February 26, 2012, <b>Glass</b> <b>ran</b> 46.06 {{to win the}} Brooks PR Invitational. His {{time was}} good for a Dempsey record (fastest of any collegiate or {{professional}} runner) and a US #1. A few weeks later on March 11, 2012, Glass became the 2012 Indoor National Champion. His time 46.57 was good for number 4 all-time.|$|R
50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows {{can be either}} fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered {{as an extension of}} the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|E
50|$|EPM has a {{large number}} of uses due to the many ways in which the polymer can be designed, for example; it is used in {{automotive}} weather-stripping and seals, self-amalgamating tape, <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> channels, radiators, garden and appliance hoses, tubing, belts, roofing membranes, expansion joints, rubber mechanical goods, plastic impact modification, thermoplastic vulcanisates and motor oil additive applications. EPM is even more prevalent as an insulator for high-voltage cables since it has improved insulative characteristics over more traditional cables, such as cross-linked polyethylene, enabling a smaller cross sectional area for the same load carrying capacity. The cable is flexible and suited to applications where regular cable movement is required such as in the mining industry.|$|E
50|$|TPEs {{are used}} where {{conventional}} elastomers cannot provide {{the range of}} physical properties needed in the product. These materials find large application in the automotive sector and in household appliances sector. In 2014 the world market for TPEs reached a volume of ca. 16.7 billion US dollars. About 40% of all TPE products {{are used in the}} manufacturing of vehicles. For instance copolyester TPEs are used in snowmobile tracks where stiffness and abrasion resistance are at a premium. They are also widely used for catheters where nylon block copolymers offer a range of softness ideal for patients. Thermoplastic silicone and olefin blends are used for extrusion of <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> and dynamic weatherstripping car profiles. Styrene block copolymers are used in shoe soles for their ease of processing, and widely as adhesives. TPE is commonly used to make suspension bushings for automotive performance applications because of its greater resistance to deformation when compared to regular rubber bushings. Thermoplastics have experienced growth in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry due to the function, cost effectiveness and adaptability to modify plastic resins into a variety of covers, fans and housings. TPE may also be used in medical devices and is also finding more and more uses as an electrical cable jacket and inner insulation. You'll also be able to find TPE used in some headphone cables.|$|E

50|$|At {{the ground}} level, large plate glass display windows {{dominate}} {{the front of}} the store. The entrance to the shop is recessed and the plate glass windows continue around the sides of the entrance alcove.

40|$|International audienceWaist {{seals and}} <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> channel {{are used for}} sealing {{purposes}} of automotive opening windows. These seals also contribute in the acoustic performance of the system specifically in the 3 kHz frequency band known as the coincidence frequency. In this paper, we present the simulation of the acoustic transparency of a car window with seals around. In a first stage, the mounting of the seals around the windows is simulated by mean of a 2 D non linear static analysis {{in order to get}} the deformed and pre-stressed state of the seal. In a second stage, a 3 D mesh of the vibro-acoustic model is built. It is composed of the 600 x 600 x 4 mm glass surrounded by the seals. All components are meshed with volumic elements. A thickness of 10 cm air behind the glass is also meshed {{in order to get the}} radiated acoustic power at this distance allowing experimental-simulation comparisons. Infinite acoustic elements are finally added to simulate an infinite space. The window is excited by a diffused field. The acoustic transparency curves are presented up to 5200 Hz. Comparisons with tests show a good correlation and give confidence in the vibro-acoustic model for predictive purposes...|$|E
5000|$|In the Danner process, {{the molten}} <b>glass</b> <b>runs</b> from the [...] as a belt onto an obliquely {{downwardly}} inclined, rotating ceramic hollow cylinder, the Danner pipe. Through the hollow pipe, compressed air is blown {{to prevent the}} glass tube from collapsing. At {{the tip of the}} pipe the so-called drawing onion is formed, from which the glass tube is drawn off in the free sag on a horizontal pulling line.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo range also {{received}} an updated interior. Instead {{of the traditional}} flat dashboard with a separate upright instrument binnacle, as in many Italian sports cars of the era (and the previous Diablo), the new dash was an integrated wave-shaped design. A thin strip of black <b>glass</b> <b>ran</b> {{the length of the}} dash and contained various instrument indicator and warning lamps. This aesthetic design was inspired by Bang & Olufsen Hi-Fi products.|$|R

This slot is formed between the round outlet nozzle of the feeder and a height-adjustable hollow needle (also a mandrel). Here, the tube is [...] "inflated" [...] with {{compressed}} air as well. The glass tube which initially emerges in the vertical direction is then deflected into the horizontal position in the free sag.|$|R

Gardosh {{tells him that}} {{he is no longer}} in charge of Tramell's therapy and that he's going to have his license revoked, due to bad practice regarding Tramell's treatment. There is a struggle between Glass and Gardosh, in which the latter is knocked out. Catherine then threatens Glass with a gun she carries, but Glass takes it away from her. When Washburn arrives at the scene, Glass shoots him because Tramell told him he had killed the girlfriend of one of Glass's patients just to [...] "nail him".|$|R

50|$|Edward Gold, the theatre's chief {{electrician}} {{and founder of}} Radio 4GR at Toowoomba, {{was responsible for the}} most striking of the interior features: the illumination of the grand proscenium arch in constantly changing colours. This was achieved by reflecting diffused light from the wall behind the arch, which was constructed of plaster open-work, and changing the colours via a complex dimmer system. As well, a huge central lamp of wrought iron and obscure <b>glass</b> <b>ran</b> much of the length of the main ceiling, distributing a soft even light throughout the auditorium. In 1933, local press claimed the Empire Theatre employed the most extensive use of diffused lighting in any theatre in the British Commonwealth, and was unlike anything else in Australia.|$|R
