25|$|This {{popularity}} is, in part, {{because most}} households did not already own VHS players when VCDs were introduced, the low {{price of the}} players, their tolerance of high humidity (a notable problem for VCRs), <b>easy</b> <b>storage</b> and maintenance, and the lower-cost media. Western sources have cited unauthorized content as a principal incentive for VCD player ownership.|$|E

25|$|Lind's {{work was}} slow to be noticed, partly because his Treatise was not {{published}} until six years after his study, and also because he recommended a lemon juice extract known as rob. Fresh fruit was very expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed <b>easy</b> <b>storage</b> but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles). Ship captains concluded wrongly that Lind's other suggestions were ineffective because those juices failed to prevent or cure scurvy.|$|E
25|$|The AB-13 {{was a small}} single-bay biplane {{of mixed}} construction. It had wooden {{stressed-skin}} wings with plywood skinning that folded to allow <b>easy</b> <b>storage</b> aboard ship, while combat flaps were fitted as the aircraft was required to have sufficient maneuverability for air combat {{as well as its}} normal observation missions. The fuselage was of metal construction, with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit, but the observer's position being enclosed. Both float and wheeled undercarriages were designed, with the seaplane having a single main float, while the landplane version had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Power was provided by a single Nakajima Hikari radial engine.|$|E
25|$|Amphorae, or amphoras, {{were used}} during Roman times to {{transport}} food on {{long and short}} distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also , the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora {{was supposed to be}} strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for <b>easy</b> <b>storage</b> in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base. The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container.|$|E

2500|$|The Widgeon first flew at Westland's Yeovil factory on 22 September 1924, {{eight days}} {{after the first of}} two Woodpigeons. [...] Its fuselage, which was very {{similar to that of the}} Woodpigeon, was of mixed steel tube and wooden construction, while the wooden parasol wing, which was tapered in both chord and thickness, folded for <b>easy</b> <b>storage.</b> [...] It was powered by a single 1,090cc Blackburne Thrush three {{cylinder}} radial engine, which produced 35hp (26kW).|$|E
2500|$|The Blackburn B-2 was {{developed}} by Blackburn as a successor for its earlier Bluebird IV trainer, retaining the layout and side-by-side seating of the earlier aircraft, but having a semi-monocoque all-metal fuselage, instead of the metal and fabric-covered fuselage used by the earlier aircraft. The single-bay biplane wings were of similar structure {{to those of the}} Bluebird IV and could be folded for <b>easy</b> <b>storage.</b> Leading edge slots were fitted to the upper wing to improve low-speed handling, with ailerons on the lower wings only. The conventional landing gear was fixed, with the mainwheels supported on telescopic legs and a spung tailskid. The prototype B-2 (registered G-ABUW) first flew on 10 December 1932, powered by a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III engine, although the [...] de Havilland Gipsy Major and 120hp Cirrus Hermes IV engines were also fitted to production aircraft. Testing proved successful, with the aircraft proving to be very manoeuvrable, and the first production aircraft flew in 1932.|$|E

50|$|When {{mounted on}} a casemate-armored assault gun-designated vehicle (Sturmpanzer) instead of a turreted tank, the weapon was called Sturmkanone 40 (StuK 40). Both the KwK 40 and StuK 40 were {{developed}} from the towed 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. The length of the ammunition used was shortened to allow for <b>easier</b> <b>storage</b> of said ammunition in vehicles the KwK 40 and StuK 40 would be mounted on.|$|R

50|$|The {{appeal of}} {{inflatable}} kayaks is their portability, their durability (they don't dent), ruggedness in white water (they bounce off rocks rather than break) and their <b>easy</b> <b>storage.</b> In addition, inflatable kayaks generally are stable, {{have a small}} turning radius and are easy to master, although some models take more effort to paddle and are slower than traditional kayaks.|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{the coffee}} is {{prepared}} in single servings in single-cup filter/brewers known as [...] Generally the coffee is served tableside {{while it is}} still brewing.

30|$|FPH is {{produced}} in two forms: liquid and dried. Liquid FPH is a watering mixture of hydrolyzed proteins, which contains up to 90 % of moisture. FPH in a liquid form is highly unstable for a long-term storage and, moreover, {{it is difficult to}} be transported. Thus, dried FPH is preferable due to a longer shelf-life, <b>easier</b> <b>storage</b> and transportation. Nevertheless, at the same time, the removal of such a big amount of water from liquid FPH is a difficult and costly task, {{which is one of the}} challenges of dried FPH production.|$|R
50|$|The project {{underwent}} several {{evaluations and}} in 2004, was re-introduced {{to the public}} as the new Enhanced Fast Response Vehicle (FRV). This time, consisting instead of modified *Toyota Hilux twin-cab pick up trucks, which utilises diesel-power and provide greater ability to endure high usage on the roads over extensive periods of time. Achieving both the original and new requirements of the project, the new vehicles' bigger storage space also allows for <b>easier</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval of equipment like chemical agent protective suits and bullet-resistant vests. The SPF plans to have two of these vehicles at all NPCs.|$|R
