40|$|A {{number of}} methods are {{available}} for determining the limits of port gravitational areas, geographic, geometrical, mainland-tariff method or total transport cost method. The basic drawback of this methods is that they take in the account either cost or geographical elements Unified theory of the port gravitational areas, under development at Maritime faculty Rijeka, takes into account other logistic elements which in today's transport conditions can be crucial in choosing {{the direction of the}} goods. This paper introduces information centrality factors used to identify communication levels between ports and their gravitational areas, and to define the levels of coordination in the logistic supply chain. modeling <b>electronic</b> commerce <b>freight</b> transport network structure simulation...|$|R

40|$|B 2 B e-Commerce {{facilitates}} {{the reduction of}} supply chain intermediaries and reduces transaction costs. This revolution has spawned a number of online marketplaces for freight transportation service procurement. The paper looks into the operational models of existing <b>electronic</b> <b>freight</b> marketplaces and the strategic behavior of shipper and carriers conducting their business in these market places. A literature survey of market clearing mechanisms models for online freight transportation market places is provided. Models for shipper-carrier strategic interaction are presented for freight transportation procurement. Some of the key research questions for developing methodologies to aid both the shippers and carriers are discussed.

30|$|The {{remaining}} ways {{to achieve}} carbon reduction focus on organisational changes, {{which have the}} charm {{that most of them}} can be introduced already in the short and medium term. There seems to exist a high unexplored potential for collaborative and reverse logistics as well as for a target conforming re-organisation of the world-wide supply chains. Collaborative logistics can mean different things: collaboration of haulage companies, of forwarders or of shippers, either within the group or between agents of different groups. If companies form alliances for their logistics systems and operations or open co-ordination platforms—for instance an <b>electronic</b> <b>freight</b> exchange or bourse—then additional possibilities of bundling transport consignments become apparent. Presently, the small- and medium-sized enterprises often have insufficient information, and the big players have little interest in cooperation because of monopolistic strategies, fear of loss of competitiveness and privacy issues. Academic case studies and practical pilot activities (e.g. for the collaborative logistic organisation of big manufacturers with their suppliers) show that after overcoming such barriers and optimal bundling of logistic activities, the companies participating could save truck kilometres in an order of magnitude of 20 – 30 %.|$|E
40|$|The {{business}} of freight transportation {{is undergoing a}} technological revolution at it moves toward the 21 st century. New technologies are being developed and adopted in each mode of freight transportation. The one technology that affects all modes is information technology. Information technology related to the coordination of logistics and supply chain management, has the capability of affecting all the modes in a similar way. This technology {{in the form of}} electronic data interchange has begun to automate, and reduce the costs of, paper flow required to move goods from shippers, through carriers and transfer points, to consignees. Surveys of the freight transportation industry indicate that the adoption of EDI has not been nearly universal in any dimension. The paper investigates the structure of the communication system used for transport supply chain. POWER <b>electronic</b> commerce <b>freight</b> transport network structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{focal point}} of {{interest}} in the research was directed towards the communications flows within the logistics value chain, since the influence of the electronic commerce technologies has become more and more evident. In {{order to be able to}} define the characteristics of the system, these researches were primarily oriented to the analysis of the communications and interorganization links of the transport logistics value chain. However, the technical characteristics of the already existing information technologies have been pointed out in order to determine what is the real value that the electronic commerce technologies have within the transport logistics value chain. Simulation has been used to define economic behavior of the model and its entities for two generic case studies - usage of the electronic and paper documents. The only difference in the models are different times to perform the activity. The results show that electronic documents can decrease the transaction costs Electronic documents diminish the time used to obtain, create the documents, and thus the costs are decreased. For one shipment (total of 103 documents) electronic documents are 39 % cheaper, then paper documents. and the difference between the electronic and paper documents is 295. 44 $ for one set of 103 documents in one shipment. It is interesting result that the dependence of the supply chain network on the government is minimal. Usage of the electronic documents diminishes the importance of the government further by 73 %. modeling <b>electronic</b> commerce <b>freight</b> transport network structure simulation...|$|R
40|$|In the {{electronic}} market place, the auction {{is known to}} be economically efficient, allowing players to maximize their own benefits. Through this mechanism, new spot markets are created, which connect buyers and sellers. In this new spot markets, many problem contexts give rise to competitive decision situations in which players must make repeated decisions along with or in response to competitors' decisions. Auction-based <b>electronic</b> marketplaces for <b>freight</b> service procurement are an example of such environments, and provide the motivating application context for the models presented in this paper. The specific focus is on the decisions of carriers, as bidders for the loads tendered by shippers in spot market situations. This paper is about the learning models used to describe a player's strategy choice behavior using experimental data and explains how that choice arises from the nature of multi-player interactions and their dynamics over multiple bids. Therefore, the principal focus of this paper is how to model a player's dynamic strategy choice behavior under the pressure of competition. A dynamic strategy choice model structure for two type of cognitive learning process is formulated, with alternative specifications corresponding to different levels of cognition capacity. Furthermore, the dynamic strategy choice model structure for mixed learning is developed, which combines both elements of two different learning processes. The model is intended to describe how a player or agent in a non-cooperative game with no perfect information and bounded rationality chooses a bidding strategy. We propose a general dynamic strategy choice model framework using the dynamic mixed logit model structure and estimate the model parametrically, using two sets of experimental data. The paper also presents econometric issues that arise in estimating such models given a time series of auction bids and outcomes, and formulates error structures appropriate to the highly interactive dynamic nature of competitive auction-based marketplaces...|$|R
