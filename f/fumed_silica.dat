40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> on compressive strength of structural lightweight concrete, containing saturated LECA (Light Expanded Clay Aggregate) as lightweight aggregate (LWA). In experimental phase of study 120 cubic specimens (10 * 10 * 10) were made and cured. For every mix design, different cement percentages were replaced with <b>silica</b> <b>fume,</b> containing same amount of saturated LECA. The mixes incorporate 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 % <b>silica</b> <b>fume.</b> Constant level of Water/Cement ratio (0. 37) was considered. For each mix design 20 specimens were prepared and cured for 7, 14, 28, 42 days in standard 20 C water.

40|$|When {{added to}} {{concrete}} in appropriate content, <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> may provide {{an increase in}} the mechanical strength of the material due to its high pozzolanic reactivity. In addition to the chemical contribution, physical changes can also be observed in concretes with <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> due to an improvement in the particle packing of the paste. This is a result of their small size spherical particles, which fill the voids between the larger cement grains. However, it is necessary to properly establish the cement replacement content by <b>silica</b> <b>fume,</b> because at high amounts, which exceed the volume of voids between the cement particles, <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> can promote the loosening of these particles. Thus, instead of filling the voids and increasing the packing density, the addition of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> will increase the volume of voids, decreasing the solid concentration. Consequently, this will impair the properties of the concrete. The objective {{of this paper is to}} use a particle packing analytical model, the CPM (Compressible Packing Model), to verify the maximum packing density of cement and <b>silica</b> <b>fume,</b> which could be associated with the <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> optimum content in pastes. The ideal content of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> in pastes, mortars and concretes is usually experimentally determined. However, a theoretical study to contrast experimental data may help understanding the behaviour of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> in mixes. Theoretical results show maximum amounts of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> in the order of 18 to 20 % of the cement weight, which is high considering recommendations on literature of 15 %. Nevertheless, the packing model does not consider the effect of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> high specific surface on the agglomeration of particles or water demand. Hence, the packing density predicted by this model cannot be used as the single parameter in determining the optimum amount of <b>silica</b> <b>fume</b> in pastes...|$|R
