5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times {{than the rest of}} the field as Massa started to pull away from Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed out to see how fast his car was in clean air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure on Button in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> mode towards the end of the race.|$|E

50|$|A 2012 {{investigation}} by SAE International of nine trailer skirt designs found that three provided <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> greater than 5%, and four provided savings between 4% and 5%, {{compared with an}} unmodified trailer. Skirts with reduced ground clearance offer greater fuel savings; in one instance, reducing ground clearance from 16 in to 8 in resulted in an improvement in <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> from 4% to 7%. One 2008 Delft University of Technology study found <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> of up to 15% for the particular design studied.

25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{ruled out}} producing a re-engined {{version of its}} 737 {{to compete with the}} Airbus A320neo family launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the Boeing Y1 and a 30% <b>fuel</b> <b>saving,</b> instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fuel {{conservation}} programs are instruments used by airlines to improve operational efficiency and trim fuel related costs. Identifying <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> to accurately manage these programs {{has always been}} an issue due to the operation volatility and lack of reliable data. Advanced data management systems were developed to support these programs, but having means to identify <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> is still compelling. A new methodology based on segmented fuel consumption profiles is proposed as a tool to accurately identify <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> across periods. This approach allows for a detailed fuel consumption analysis with full operation coverage...|$|R

2500|$|During the ship's 1986 to 1987 refit, {{the steam}} {{turbines}} were removed and scrapped. The engine rooms were then fitted with nine German MAN L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, {{in addition to}} powering the ship's auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each. The ship's service speed of [...] can be maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. Her maximum power output with the new engine configuration running was now 130,000hp, which {{is greater than the}} previous system's 110,000hp.

40|$|The U. S. federal {{government}} enacted fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy trucks {{for the first}} time in September 2011. Rationales for using this policy tool typically depend upon frictions existing in the marketplace or consumers being myopic, such that vehicle purchasers undervalue the future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> from increased <b>fuel</b> efficiency. We measure by how much long-haul truck owners undervalue future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> by employing recent advances to the classic hedonic approach to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for fuel efficiency. We find significant heterogeneity in truck owners' willingness to pay for fuel efficiency, with the elasticity of fuel efficiency to price ranging from 0. 51 at the 10 th percentile to 1. 33 at the 90 th percentile, and an average of 0. 91. Combining these results with estimates of future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> from increases in fuel efficiency, we find that long-haul truck owners' willingness-to-pay for a 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency is, on average, just 29. 5 percent of the expected future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings.</b> These results suggest that introducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks might be an effective policy tool to raise medium and heavy trucks' fuel economy...|$|R

40|$|The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) {{collected}} and analyzed real-world school bus drive cycle data and selected similar standard drive cycles for testing on a chassis dynamometer.
