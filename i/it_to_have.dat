5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers {{praised the}} artificial intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} the artificial intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Monica {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on 23 April near Cape Wessel with a barometric pressure 916mbar (hPa; 27.05inHg). Maximum winds were estimated at 250km/h (155mph 10-minute sustained) by the Bureau of Meteorology while the JTWC assessed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> attained winds of 285km/h (180mph 1-minute sustained). Using the Dvorak technique, the peak {{intensity of the}} cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale. However, since the JTWC, SAB and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the president should be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E

5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E

Because of {{a requirement for}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least 65,000 seats for the World Cup opening match, temporary seats {{were added to the}} stadium for the tournament.

5|$|Later on August3, the JTWC issued {{their first}} {{advisory}} on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Depression 14W. Located {{to the west}} of a mid-level ridge, the depression was steered towards the north. Early the next day, the JTWC upgraded 14W to a tropical storm; the JMA later upgraded it to a tropical storm around 1200UTC. At that time, the storm received the name Meranti, a name that was contributed by Cambodia. Little intensification took place until August5, at which time convection became increasingly organized and underwent a brief period of rapid intensification. By 1200UTC, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Meranti to a typhoon. Several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity; the JMA assessed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had winds of 140km/h (85mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC assessed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> attained Category 2 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 165km/h (105mph).|$|E

5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E

5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E
5|$|The network {{largely ignored}} the {{standard}} business model of 1950s TV, {{in which one}} advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to many different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for US television.

5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since.

5|$|The {{technology}} {{of everyday life}} is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{similar to that in}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland and kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate. Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and crannogs remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.|$|E
5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
