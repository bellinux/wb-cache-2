5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book <b>depository</b> appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted <b>depository</b> superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E

40|$|The lonelier {{evacuees}} find themselves, the riskier {{become their}} wayfinding decisions. This research supports single evacuees in a dynamically changing environment with risk-aware guidance. It deploys {{the concept of}} decentralized evacuation, where evacuees are guided by smartphones acquiring environmental knowledge and risk information via exploration and knowledge sharing by peer-to-peer communication. Peer-to-peer communication, however, relies on the chance that people come into communication range with each other. This chance can be low. To bridge between people being not {{at the same time}} at the same places, this paper suggests information <b>depositories</b> at strategic locations to improve information sharing. Information <b>depositories</b> collect the knowledge acquired by the smartphones of evacuees passing by, maintain this information, and convey it to other passing-by evacuees. Multi-agent simulation implementing these <b>depositories</b> in an indoor environment shows that integrating <b>depositories</b> improves evacuation performance: It enhances the risk awareness and consequently increases the chance that people survive and reduces their evacuation time. For evacuating dynamic events, deploying <b>depositories</b> at staircases has been shown more effective than deploying them in corridors...|$|R

The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{toward the rear}} of the presidential limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its bumper, was reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world.
