As it did {{not seem}} likely that this law of the {{assumption}} of conducting power during liquefaction, and loss of it during congelation, would be peculiar to water, I immediately proceeded to ascertain its influence in other cases, and found it to be very <b>general.</b> For this <b>purpose</b> <b>bodies</b> were chosen which were solid at common temperatures, but readily fusible; and of such composition as, for other reasons connected with electrochemical action, led to the conclusion that they would be able when fused to replace water as conductors. A voltaic battery of two troughs, or twenty pairs of four-inch plates (384.), was used as the source of electricity, and a galvanometer introduced into the circuit to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} a current.|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} developed flexible body dynamic formulation for simulating beam structures undergoing large overall motion, {{restricted to}} two-dimensional prescribed motion, is {{extended to the}} study of both three-dimensional prescribed motion and non-prescribed motion. The formulation, called the Augmented Imbedded Geometric Constraint (AIGC) approach, is restricted to small elastic deformations of the beam structure. The overall motion is characterized by six degrees of freedom, while the elastic deformation is characterized by the superposition of a number of assumed global shape functions, developed using substructuring techniques. This extension allows the approach to be applied {{to the study of}} a broader spectrum of problems involving systems with applied forces / torques where the overall motion is not known. Thus, the formulation can be used to study the two-way interaction between overall motion and local deformation which is fundamental to a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> flexible <b>body</b> dynamic formulation. The AIGC approach describes the elastodynamic behavior with a set of differential equations linearized in terms of the deformation degrees of freedom (but not in the degrees of freedom describing the overall motion), and a number of, possibly nonlinear, constraint equations describing the physical attachments of the ends of the beam. The beam characterization is extended to include the effects of torsion, rotatory inertia, and an offset between the centroid and shear center of the beam (eccentricity). Transverse shear deformation is neglected as it is generally not of importance in flexible beam dynamics. The validity of the extended formulation is demonstrated by comparison of solutions for two validation problems to independently obtained solutions...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} set up as a mini KTP funded by Northumbria Enterprises and Airowear (7 K), a {{regional}} SME specialising {{in the design and}} manufacture of equestrian body protection equipment. One outcome was ‘Zippa’; a new and easier to fit and wear <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> upper <b>body</b> protector. Zippa meets higher test standards, coupled with a simplified manufacturing methodology and stronger market definition for the company. It maintains the company’s product range as the leading UK manufactured product. This success required knowledge assets to be integrated within the organisation, allowing the development and manufacturing teams to share coherent design files for all the company’s products. Airowear has recently been short-listed as one of three finalist for Northeast business awards; ‘Best Small Business’ and ‘Best Innovation’ awards 2007 : [URL] Airowear received a best new product nomination by Beta for its range of colour swaps. The company has currently doubled its sales of body protectors this year; it now supplies some of the UK’s best event riders and consequently sponsors OETCC events, one of the leading equestrian events in the world. [URL] Throughout the programme Smith developed a closer working relationship for the company with the Blue Hibiscus test house concerning industry standard; EN 13158 2000; leading to their increased understanding of design and manufacturing changes within Airowear. A closer working relationship was also developed with the standards body SATRA. The Airowear CEO now sits on its board. Smith worked closely with Newcastle University School of Engineering to enable research by the CfDR, Newcastle and Airowear regarding non-PVC foams for use in body protector construction (research funding £ 16 k). Proposals to research dynamic test methodologies to more closely replicate impacts commonly occurring in falls by horse riders are being planned...|$|R

40|$|In {{the debate}} over the {{governance}} of metropolitan areas, consolidationists favour single, area-wide, <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> jurisdictions, while polycentrists make arguments in support of multiple, scale-specific, specialized jurisdictions. This dissertation contributes to this debate through comparisons of municipal and specialized service delivery in two Ontario cities. The cities of London and Hamilton represent positions along a continuum of fragmentation and consolidation, with London being more fragmented and Hamilton more consolidated. Comparisons are undertaken for three local government services: public health, economic development, and watershed management. In London, independent special <b>purpose</b> <b>bodies</b> deliver all three of these services, while in Hamilton the municipality is responsible for public health and economic development and controls the main conservation authority. The central objective of this dissertation is to test the competing claims of consolidationists and polycentrists by comparing the performance of these three functions in the two cities. It looks at such performance measures as efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, coordination, and responsiveness. The results of the comparisons are mixed. On balance, the hypotheses of the consolidationists are supported more often than the hypotheses of the polycentrists, but this debate is overly simplistic. In reality, specialized governments pursue their mandate more single-mindedly than <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> governments. The policy consequences of this characteristic are more or less pronounced depending upon how autonomous the board is. There are some positive consequences associated with specialized delivery for public health and watershed management, because the benefits of these types of services are enjoyed by most citizens, but they are not always a priority for municipal politicians. However for economic development, the policy consequences were mainly negative. This is because specialization in this functional area enhances the power of business interests. In short, much can be understood about the behaviour of special <b>purpose</b> <b>bodies</b> by how they are controlled and by what function they perform. When applied to more general debates about metropolitan governance, the findings make it clear that even relatively small differences in local government structures can have significant policy consequences...|$|R
