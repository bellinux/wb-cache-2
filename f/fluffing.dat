25|$|The {{breeding}} season is December to September but {{varies according to}} region and usually begins with the first rains. Peak breeding in northern India is in June and is earlier in Southern India. In Sri Lanka it breeds in March to June and August to September. Males sing during this season and display by lowering and spreading their tail feathers and strutting around the female, displaying their sides and <b>fluffing</b> their undertail coverts. The songs of males have variants for inviting mates and for deterring other males. Males will drive away other males and patrol their territory by flying with slow wing-beats from perch to perch. They may sometimes peck at their reflections. An aggressive display involves <b>fluffing</b> up the feathers and holding the bill high.|$|E
25|$|A new mix {{was created}} for the stereo version of the album, and on 25 February 1963 Martin made one created from {{original}} takes 16, 17 and 18. This stereo version has Lennon <b>fluffing</b> the final verse, causing him to sing 'come on' with a slight chuckle in his voice. Also different in the stereo mix is Harrison's lead guitar line before the final verse; rather than duplicating the overdubbed harmonica exactly as he had earlier in the song, Harrison drops down a fourth for the third note, rather than continuing down by stepwise motion.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight of}} the great grey shrike is undulating and rather heavy, but its dash is {{straight}} and determined. It is, as noted above, also capable of hovering flights, which last briefly but may be repeated time after time because of the birds' considerable stamina. It will usually stay low above the ground in flight, approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop. In social interactions, birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture, fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited. It signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and <b>fluffing</b> its feathers, raising them into a small crest {{along the top of}} the head. Birds appease conspecifics by head-turns away from them (if close by), or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food (if sitting father apart). The submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker, noted that the premise of a politician without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an HBO production. Laura Bennett of The New Republic states that in season 1 Meyer is [...] "a hapless buffoon, <b>fluffing</b> her hair and running in circles", who endures marginalization and irrelevance, but in season 2, which is set during midterm elections, she is [...] "a player in the administration with concrete involvement in foreign policy".|$|E
500|$|Blackcaps first breed {{when they}} are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, {{although}} both sexes may sometimes deviate from this. A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display involving raising the black crown feathers, <b>fluffing</b> the tail, slow wingbeats, and a short flapping flight.

40|$|This letter {{has been}} {{prepared}} as a consultation to determine some potential health concerns {{raised by a}} resident of Spencer from exposure to wire shredder <b>fluff</b> material emitted by Shine Brothers metal salvaging facility in Spencer, Iowa on July 10, 2011 and, a concern regarding the health impacts from the level of noise measured by a resident near the metal salvaging facility. Background and Statement of Issues A resident of Spencer has expressed some concern regarding potential adverse health effects from exposure to wire shredder <b>fluff</b> material that was emitted by Shine Brothers on July 10, 2011. It is our understanding that this wire shredder <b>fluff</b> material was accidentally emitted by Shine Brothers when a cyclone separator within the facility was not properly emptied and overflowed emitting the wire shredder <b>fluff</b> to the outside environment. A concern regarding inhalation exposure to the <b>fluff</b> material and exposure to the chemicals that may be found within the wire shredder <b>fluff</b> material was expressed by the resident. Samples of the <b>fluff</b> material were collected by you and analyzed for fiber content and for the concentration of a few heavy metals.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{episode was}} not broadcast until 26 August 1991, when the BBC aired a version that edited together {{the first half}} of the taping with one of the two completed second halves. As it happened, the version chosen was the one in which the TARDIS doors would not close; other errors included actress Carole Ann Ford <b>fluffing</b> a line of dialogue, Jacqueline Hill getting caught in a doorway, a camera banging into a piece of scenery during one of the scrapyard sequences, and William Russell accidentally knocking over a mannequin in the scrapyard. Earlier, in June 1991, a version with the first half edited together with the other take of the second half of the pilot was released on the VHS compilation The Hartnell Years; later, in 2000, the complete version (including both takes) was released in a remastered form on VHS, along with The Edge of Destruction. In 2006, the Doctor Who: The Beginning DVD set contained two versions of the episode: an unedited studio recording including all takes of the second part of the show, and a newly created version of the pilot that uses the best footage from the original recording, with additional editing and digital adjustments to remove blown lines, technical problems, and reduce studio noise. Like the other episodes from this serial, both versions of the [...] "pilot" [...] were remastered for DVD release, using VidFIRE technology that simulated the original video look of the 1963 production.|$|E

6000|$|Pierson had {{a sort of}} vertigo; if he had moved, he {{must have}} fallen down. Nollie! He slid round and sank into his chair, and by some horrible cruel fiction of his nerves, he seemed to feel Noel on his knee, as, when a little girl, she had been wont to sit, with her fair hair <b>fluffing</b> against his cheek. He seemed to feel that hair {{tickling}} his skin; it used to be the greatest comfort he had known since her mother died. At that moment his pride shrivelled like a flower held to a flame; all that abundant secret pride of a father who loves and admires, who worships still a dead wife in the children she has left him; who, humble by nature, yet never knows how proud he is till the bitter thing happens; all the long pride of the priest who, by dint of exhortation and remonstrance has coated himself in a superiority he hardly suspects--all this pride shrivelled in him. Then something writhed and cried within, as a tortured beast cries, at loss to know why it is being tortured. How many times has not a man used those words: [...] "My God! My God! Why hast Thou forsaken me!" [...] He sprang up and tried to pace his way out of this cage of confusion: His thoughts and feelings made the strangest medley, spiritual and worldly--Social ostracism--her soul in peril--a trial sent by God! The future! Imagination failed him. He went to his little piano, opened it, closed it again; took his hat, and stole out. He walked fast, without knowing where. It was very cold--a clear, bitter evening. Silent rapid motion in the frosty air was some relief. As Noel had fled from him, having uttered her news, so did he fly from her. The afflicted walk fast. He was soon down by the river, and turned West along its wall. The moon was up, bright and nearly full, and the steel-like shimmer of its light burnished the ebbing water. A cruel night! He came to the Obelisk, and leaned against it, overcome by a spasm of realisation. He seemed to see his dead wife's face staring at him out of the past, like an accusation. [...] "How have you cared for Nollie, that she should have come to this?" [...] It became the face of the moonlit sphinx, staring straight at him, the broad dark face with wide nostrils, cruel lips, full eyes blank of pupils, all livened and whitened by the moonlight--an embodiment of the marvellous unseeing energy of Life, twisting and turning hearts without mercy. He gazed into those eyes with a sort of scared defiance. The great clawed paws of the beast, the strength and remorseless serenity of that crouching creature with human head, made living by his imagination and the moonlight, seemed to him like a temptation to deny God, like a refutation of human virtue.|$|E
