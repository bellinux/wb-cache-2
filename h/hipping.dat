Based on structural and functional data, these proteins participate in the clathrin trafficking network. The inactivation of <b>Hip</b> 1 in mice leads to spinal, hematopoietic, and testicular defects. To investigate the biological function of <b>HIP</b> 1 r, we generated a <b>Hip</b> 1 r mutant allele in mice. <b>Hip</b> 1 r homozygous mutant mice are viable and fertile without obvious morphological abnormalities. In addition, embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice do not have gross abnormalities in survival, proliferation, or clathrin trafficking pathways.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} hot {{isostatic}} pressing (<b>HIPping)</b> variables such as <b>HIPping</b> temperature, <b>HIPping</b> cycle and powder particle size, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of HIPped samples of two Ti alloys have been assessed. Powders {{of the most commonly}} used (α + β) alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and one specific beta alloy, Ti- 25 V- 15 Cr- 2 Al- 0. 2 C wt% (burn resistant titanium alloy, BuRTi) were studied. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder was made by the plasma rotating electrode process (PREP). BuRTi powders, which were made both by gas atomisation and by PREP were HIPped to investigate the influence of the initial structure of the powder on the microstructure and associated mechanical properties of the HIPped alloy. The PREP Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder was shown to be fully martensitic in the as-atomised condition. The gas-atomised and PREP powders of BuRTi showed very different as-atomised structures, but in both cases the structure was, as expected single phase beta, with the carbon retained insolution. The individual particles of gas-atomised BuRTi powder were always polycrystalline, although there was a significant scatter in grain sizes within different particles. In contrast the individual particles in the PREP powder were either coarse grained polycrystals or single crystals. These differences led to significant differences in the microstructures and properties of HIPped samples. It was found that <b>HIPping</b> of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples resulted in the formation of equiaxed regions and lath-like microstructure. The small equiaxed regions are formed by recrystallisation which occurs at original particle boundaries where most of the deformation occurs during HIPping; the lath-like microstructure is formed by simply tempering the (less deformed) original alpha prime martensite within the central part of original particles. Among the three <b>HIPping</b> temperatures used, samples machined from powder HIPped at 930 °C exhibited a better balance of properties than those HIPped at 880 °C or 1020 °C. The fatigue properties of samples HIPped at 930 °C, made using different <b>HIPping</b> procedures were compared. It was found that samples which contain the as-HIPped surface, which were made using a new <b>HIPping</b> procedure, have better fatigue properties than samples with as-HIPped, machined or electro-polished surfaces which were produced by conventional <b>HIPping.</b> The properties of optimally HIPped Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples are as good as or better than ingot-route samples. In the case of BuRTi the original single crystals or coarse grained polycrystals in the PREP powder are retained after <b>HIPping</b> and limited grain growth occurs in the gas-atomised samples. The tensile strength is comparable for the gas-atomised and PREP samples, but samples tested to failure showed a significant scatter in ductility (a larger scatter in the PREP powder samples) and all fracture surfaces contained large circular fracture initiation sites, with larger sites associated with lower ductility. Initiation occurs in the centre of these circular regions in large grains or in adjacent grains which have similar orientations and the failed region expands symmetrically in powder samples where no texture is expected. The fatigue properties of the PREP samples are much lower whereas the fatigue properties of the gas atomised samples are better than those of samples from ingot route. This behaviour is associated with obvious facetted failure sites in the PREP powder samples where it is suggested that the coarser microstructure has allowed persistent slip to occur leading to localised deformation and to premature failure. These observations are discussed in terms of the potential of net shape <b>HIPping</b> for the production of engineering components and in this context the fact that a new <b>HIPping</b> schedule has been developed during this study, where the fatigue properties of samples containing an as-HIPped surface are excellent, is very significant.

Samples which had been rapidly cooled from near the melting point from a Bridgman furnace, where a thermal gradient was imposed, have been used to understand the grain refinement mechanism and the details of the solidification sequence. In addition the structure of powder samples, which have been gas-atomised and hence very rapidly cooled have also been used to further the understanding of solidification and of the role of borides. It has been shown that borides themselves play an important role in grain refinement. It has been shown that <b>HIPping</b> results in the formation of a surface which is caused by oxidation from the oxygen present in the argon used in the HIP. The details of the chemistry and microstructure of the surface layers have been shown to be influenced by oxygen partial pressure, by <b>HIPping</b> time and <b>HIPping</b> temperature. Conventional <b>HIPping</b> conditions lead to a surface which contains a γ-layer which does not appear to downgrade either the tensile properties or fatigue properties of the samples and may slightly improve the corrosion resistance.

40|$|At {{the limits}} of the range of <b>hip</b> motion, impingement, {{subluxation}} and edge loading can cause osteoarthritis in natural <b>hips</b> or early failure <b>hip</b> replacements. The aim of this PhD was to investigate the role of <b>hip</b> joint soft tissues throughout the range of <b>hip</b> motion to better understand their role in preventing (or perhaps even causing) these problematic load cases. A musculoskeletal model was used to investigate the muscular contribution to edge loading and found that in the mid-range of <b>hip</b> motion, the lines of action of <b>hip</b> muscles pointed inward from the acetabular rim and thus would stabilise the <b>hip.</b> However, in deep <b>hip</b> flexion with adduction, nearly half the muscles had unfavourable lines of action which could encourage edge loading. Conversely, in-vitro tests on nine cadaveric <b>hips</b> found that the <b>hip</b> capsular ligaments were slack in the mid-range of <b>hip</b> motion but tightened to restrain excessive <b>hip</b> rotation in positions close to {{the limits of}} <b>hip</b> motion. This passive restraint prevented the <b>hip</b> from moving into positions where the muscle lines of action were found to be unfavourable and thus could help protect the <b>hip</b> from edge loading.
