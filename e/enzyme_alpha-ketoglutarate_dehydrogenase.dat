Reactive nitrating species have specifically been implicated in AD based on immunochemical and instrumental detection of nitrotyrosine in AD brain protein. The significance of lipid-phase nitration has not been investigated in AD. This study documents a significant two- to threefold increase in the lipid nitration product 5 -nitro-gamma-tocopherol in affected regions of the AD brain as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In a bioassay to compare the relative potency of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol against nitrative stress, rat brain mitochondria {{were exposed to the}} peroxynitrite-generating compound SIN- 1. The oxidation-sensitive Kreb's cycle <b>enzyme</b> <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> was inactivated by SIN- 1, in a manner that could be significantly attenuated by gamma-tocopherol (at < 10 microM) but not by alpha-tocopherol. These data indicate that nitric oxide-derived species are significant contributors to lipid oxidation in the AD brain. The findings are discussed in reference to the neuroinflammatory hypothesis of AD and the possible role of gamma-tocopherol as a major lipid-phase scavenger of reactive nitrogen species...|$|E

In order to elucidate the contribution {{that each of these}} components exerts over metabolic respiratory control as well as the impact of MAO-B elevation on their spare respiratory capacities, we performed metabolic respiratory control analysis. In addition to KGDH, we assessed the activities and substrate-mediated respiration of complex I, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and mitochondrial aconitase in the absence and presence of complex-specific inhibitors in specific and mixed substrate conditions in mitochondria from our MAO-B elevated cells versus controls. Data from this study indicates that Complex I and KGDH are the most sensitive to inhibition by MAO-B mediated H 2 O 2 generation, and could be instrumental in determining the fate of mitochondrial metabolism in this cellular PD model system...|$|E

40|$|Abnormalities {{in energy}} {{metabolism}} and oxidative stress accompany many neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Previously, we showed decreased activities of a Mitochondrial <b>enzyme</b> complex, <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex (KGDHC), and marked increases in tissue malondialdehyde levels in post-mortem superior frontal cortex from the patients with PSP. The current study demonstrates that KGDHC is also significantly diminished (- 58 %) in the cerebellum from patients with PSP (n = 14), compared to age-matched control brains (n = 13). In contrast to cortex, markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde, tyrosine nitration or general protein carbonyl modification, {{did not increase}} in cerebellum. Furthermore, the protein levels of the individual components of KGDHC did not decline. The activities of two other mitochondrial enzymes were measured {{to determine whether the}} changes in KGDHC were selective. The activity of aconitase, a mitochondrial enzyme with an iron/sulfur cluster, is also significantly diminished (- 50 %), whereas glutamate dehydrogenase activity is unchanged. The present results suggest that the interaction of metabolic impairment and oxidative stress is region-specific in PSP brain.

40|$|Anaerobic {{growth of}} Klebsiella aerogenes NCDO 711 (NCTC 418) on citrate was {{dependent}} {{on the presence of}} Na+ in the medium, and fermentation of citrate was mediated via the fermentation pathway enzymes, citrate lyase and a Na+-dependent oxalacetate decarboxylase. This confirms the previous findings on strain NCTC 418. Growth under aerobic conditions was independent of Na+. The mean generation time for cells grown aerobically on either Na+ or K+ citrate medium was about 60 min, with a molar growth yield of about 40 g (dry weight) of cells per mol of citrate utilized. Citrate was apparently metabolized aerobically in both the Na+ and K+ citrate cells via the citric acid cycle, since cell extracts contained <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> but not the citrate fermentation enzymes. The presence of theother enzymes of the citric acid cycle in K. aerogenes was shown in earlier studies. Under aerated conditions (no detectable oxygen tension in the culture), growth was faster on the Na+ citrate medium (mean generation time, 85 min) than on the K+ citrate medium (mean generation time, 120 min). Both cultures grew slower than under aerobic conditions, presumably because of oxygen limitation. Despite the faster growth rate, the molar growth yield of the aerated Na+ citrate culture was one-half that observed for the aerated K+ citrate culture. Citrate was metabolized via the citric acid cycle in cells grown in the K+ citrate medium under aerated conditions since <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> but not the fermentation enzymes, was detected in extracts prepared from these cells. Metabolism of citrate in the Na+ citrate medium under aerated conditions occurred via both the fermentation pathway (approximately 75 percent) and the citric acid cycle (about 25 percent), as evidenced by (i) the presence of the fermentation <b>enzymes</b> and <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> in extracts of cells grown under these conditions, (ii) a molar growth yield which was intermediate between that obtained for anaerobic and aerated K+ citrate cultures, and (iii) the excretion of acetate, which also occurred in anaerobic cultures but not in aerated K+ citrate or aerobic cultures...|$|R
40|$|Tetrahydroisoquinolines (TIQs) are {{endogenous}} alkaloid compounds {{detected in}} urine, {{central nervous system}} and some peripheral tissues in Mammalia. No data are at present available on TIQ levels in skin, although in vitro biochemical evidences indicate that they may undergo auto-oxidation with production of reactive oxygen species or may be enzymatically converted into melanin pigments. The effect of two catechol-bearing TIQs, salsolinol (SAL) and tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), on the viability of melanotic or amelanotic melanoma cell lines was investigated. Both SAL and THP were well tolerated up to roughly 30 muM and became overtly toxic at higher concentrations, with SAL being better tolerated than THP. Intracellular activity of some antioxidant <b>enzymes,</b> tyrosinase and <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> was also evaluated to assess the cell response to oxidative and metabolic challenge of TIQs treatment. Catalase and superoxide dismutase pre-treatment only partially prevented TIQs toxicity while a complete protection was obtained with N-acetylcysteine and GSH. TIQs were able to provoke upregulation of the scavenging enzymes catalase and DT-diaphorase and to determine a decrease of the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity. SAL and THP enhanced tyrosinase activity and melanin production, suggesting that they were indeed tyrosinase substrates leading to melanin formation. The results support the evidence that TIQs were toxic toward melanoma cells, leading to their death by necrosis. TIQs toxicity was likely due to increased oxidative stress by generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative metabolites. Our study represents an intent to furnish an additional contribution for the comprehension of catechol cytotoxicity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The growth phenotypes of Rm 30222 (gabT) and eight mutants in gabD 1, 2, 3, and 4 on minimal media were comparable to that of the wild-type. Compared to wild-type, Rm 30222 (gabT) lacked alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase activity showed high induction of gabT on GABA but produced green plants indicative of being Fix+. Mutants in gabD alleles maintained wild-type levels of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity and could fix nitrogen as well as the wild-type in symbiosis. Mutation of sucB encoding a subunit of a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase produced a mutant, Rm 30230, that initially had difficulty growing on minimal media supplemented with either arabinose or glutamate. In symbiosis with alfalfa, Rm 30230 had a fix- phenotype and was also devoid of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity. The ability of Rm 30230 to grow on arabinose or glutamate, without <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity, strengthens the hypothesis that S. meliloti has a functional GABA shunt allowing it to circumvent the forward-direction TCA cycle from alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate.

The KGD 1 gene has been cloned by transformation of a representative kgd 1 mutant, C 225 /U 1, with a recombinant plasmid library of wild-type yeast nuclear DNA. Transformants containing the gene on a multicopy plasmid had three- to four-times-higher <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity than did wild-type S. cerevisiae.

The encoded protein had 38 % identical residues with the reported sequence of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> from Escherichia coli. Two lines of evidence indicated that transcription of KGD 1 is catabolite repressed. Higher steady-state levels of KGD 1 mRNA were detected in wild-type yeast grown on the nonrepressible sugar galactose than in yeast grown on high glucose. Regulation of KGD 1 was also studied by fusing different 5 '-flanking regions of KGD 1 to the lacZ gene of E. coli and measuring the expression of beta-galactosidase in yeast. Transformants harboring a fusion of 693 nucleotides of the 5 '-flanking sequence expressed 10 times more beta-galactosidase activity when grown under derepressed conditions.

The levels of these enzymes increase rapidly during late exponential phase in a complex medium and are maximal 1 to 2 h after the onset of sporulation. Regulation of enzyme synthesis has been studied in the wild type and different citric acid cycle mutants by adding various metabolites to the growth medium. <b>Alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> is induced by glutamate or alpha-ketoglutarate; succinate dehydrogenase is repressed by malate; and fumarase and malic enzyme are induced by fumarate and malate, respectively.

Obligate methanotrophy and obligate autotrophy among the chemo- and photo-lithotrophic bacteria lack satisfactory explanation a century or more after their discovery. Various causes of these phenomena have been suggested, which we review {{in the light of the}} information currently available. Among these suggestions is the absence in vivo of a functional <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> The advent of complete and partial genome sequences of diverse autotrophs, methylotrophs and methanotrophs makes it possible to probe the reasons for the absence of activity of this enzyme. We review the role and evolutionary origins of the Krebs cycle in relation to autotrophic metabolism and describe the use of in silico methods to probe the partial and complete genome sequences of a variety of obligate genera for genes encoding the subunits of the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex. Nitrosomonas europaea and Methylococcus capsulatus, which lack the functional enzyme, were found to contain the coding sequences for the El and E 2 subunits of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Comparing the predicted physicochemical properties of the polypeptides coded by the genes confirmed the putative gene products were similar to the active <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> subunits of heterotrophs. These obligate species are thus genomically competent with respect to this enzyme but are apparently incapable of producing a functional enzyme. Probing of the full and incomplete genomes of some cyanobacterial and methanogenic genera and Aquifex confirms or suggests the absence of the genes for at least one of the three components of the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex in these obligate organisms. It is recognized that absence of a single functional enzyme may not explain obligate autotrophy in all cases and may indeed be only be one of a number of controls that impose obligate metabolism. Availability of more genome sequences from obligate genera will enable assessment of whether obligate autotrophy is due to the absence of genes for a few or many steps in organic compound metabolism.

A mutant strain of B. japonicum, LSG 184, was constructed with the sucA gene interrupted by a kanamycin resistance marker. LSG 184 is devoid of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity, indicating {{that there is only}} one copy of sucA in B. japonicum and that it is completely inactivated in the mutant. Batch culture experiments on minimal medium revealed that LSG 184 grows well on a variety of carbon substrates, including arabinose, malate, succinate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol, formate, and galactose. The sucA mutant is not a succinate auxotroph but has a reduced ability to use glutamate as a carbon or nitrogen source and an increased sensitivity to growth inhibition by acetate, relative to the parental strain. Because LSG 184 grows well on malate or succinate as its sole carbon source, we conclude that B. japonicum, unlike most other bacteria, does not require an intact tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to meet its energy needs when growing on the four-carbon TCA cycle intermediates.

Mutants unable to express KE 1 or KE 2 form partial complexes similar to those reported in earlier studies on the resolution and reconstitution of bacterial and mammalian KGDC. Thus mutants lacking KE 1 assemble a high-molecular-weight subcomplex consisting of a KE 2 core particle with bound dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E 3). Similarly, mitochondrial extracts of mutants lacking KE 2 contain dimeric KE 1 and E 3. These components, however, are not associated with each other. The partial complexes detected in the mutants are capable of reconstituting normal KGDC when supplied with the missing subunit. Complete restoration of overall <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity is achieved by mixing appropriate ratios of mitochondrial extracts from mutants deficient in KE 1 and KE 2. The reconstitution of enzymatic activity correlates with binding of KE 1 to the KE 2 -E 3 particle to form a complex with the same sedimentation properties as wild-type KGDC. Overexpression of KE 2 relative to KE 1 results in a preponderance of incompletely assembled complexes with substoichiometric contents of KE 1. Formation of a complex with {{a full complement of}} KE 1 therefore depends on a balanced output of KE 1 and KE 2 from their respective genes. Biochemical screens of a pet mutant collection have led to the identification of a new gene required for the expression of enzymatically active KGDC.

Sedimentation analysis of these components indicates that while the mutant has a stable KE 2 -E 3 subcomplex, the interaction of KE 1 with KE 2 core is much weaker in the mutant than in the wild type. The gene product responsible for this phenotype, therefore, appears to function at a late stage of {{assembly of}} KGDC, most likely by posttranslational modification of one of the subunits...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate ATP consumption in respiration-impaired isolated and in situ neuronal somal mitochondria from transgenic mice with a deficiency of either dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) or dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) that exhibit a 20 - 48 % decrease in KGDHC activity. Import of ATP into the mitochondrial matrix of transgenic mice was attributed to a shift in the reversal potential of the adenine nucleotide translocase toward more negative values due to diminished matrix substrate-level phosphorylation, which causes the translocase to reverse prematurely. Immunoreactivity of all three subunits of succinyl-CoA ligase and maximal enzymatic activity were unaffected in transgenic mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Therefore, decreased matrix substrate-level phosphorylation was due to diminished provision of succinyl-CoA. These results were corroborated further by the finding that mitochondria from wild-type mice respiring on substrates supporting substrate-level phosphorylation exhibited approximately 30 % higher ADP-ATP exchange rates compared to those obtained from DLST+/- or DLD+/- littermates. We propose that KGDHC-associated pathologies are a consequence of the inability of respiration-impaired mitochondria to rely on "in-house" mitochondrial ATP reserves. -Kiss, G., Konrad, C., Doczi, J., Starkov, A.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the genome of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic crenarchaeon, Aeropyrum pernix Kl, which optimally grows at 95 °C, has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with some modifications. The {{entire length of the}} genome was 1, 669, 695 bp. The authenticity of the entire sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long PCR products, which were directly amplified from the genomic DNA. As the potential protein-coding regions, a total of 2, 694 open reading frames (ORFs) were assigned. By similarity search against public databases, 633 (23. 5 %) of the ORFs were related to genes with putative function and 523 (19. 4 %) to the sequences registered but with unknown function. All the genes in the TCA cycle except for that of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> were included, and instead of the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> gene, the genes coding for the two subunits of 2 -oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified. The remaining 1, 538 ORFs (57. 1 %) did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases. Sequence comparison among the assigned ORFs suggested that a considerable member of ORFs were generated by sequence duplication. The RNA genes identified were a single 16 S- 23 S rRNA operon, two 5 S rRNA genes and 47 tRNA genes including 14 genes with intron structures. All the assigned ORFs and RNA coding regions occupied 89. 12 % of the whole genome. The data presented in this paper are available on the internet homepag...|$|R
50|$|Because malate {{dehydrogenase}} is {{closely tied to}} the citric acid cycle, regulation is highly dependent on TCA products. Citrate also affects MDH activity by very complex manner. It inhibits the reduction of oxaloacetate under all conditions. Citrate also inhibits malate oxidation, but only at low malate or NAD concentrations. When both malate and NAD concentrations are high (10 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l, respectively), citrate can actually augment MDH2 activity. All three effectors (malate, oxaloacetate and citrate) bind to the same putative allosteric site. Recent studies of mitochondrial {{malate dehydrogenase}} are focused into the nature of the inactivation processes. The oligomeric structure of MDH2 has a variety of biological implications. Some researches have suggested that the dimeric structure is critical for enzymatic activity. It was first proposed that the reciprocating compulsory ordered mechanism where each subunit alternates as the active and the helper subunit, but both are needed for activity. This mechanism predicts an inactive monomer, and was corroborated by studies that showed a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity. Studies with mitochondrial MDH2 have shown that this enzyme is allosterically regulated as a complex as well. Binding experiments indicate that mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase can associate with the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex and that mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase can associate with this binary complex to form a ternary complex. Formation of this ternary complex enables low levels of the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex, {{in the presence of the}} aminotransferase, to reverse inhibition of malate oxidation by glutamate. Thus, glutamate can react with the aminotransferase in this complex without glutamate inhibiting production of oxalacetate by the malate dehydrogenase in the complex. The conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate could also be facilitated because in the trienzyme complex, oxalacetate might be directly transferred from malate dehydrogenase to the aminotransferase. In addition, association of malate dehydrogenase with these other two enzymes enhances malate dehydrogenase activity due to a marked decrease in the Km of malate. The potential ability of the aminotransferase to transfer directly alpha-ketoglutarate to the <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex in this multienzyme system plus the ability of succinyl-CoA, a product of this transfer, to inhibit citrate synthase could play a role in preventing alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate from accumulating in high levels. This would maintain the catalytic activity of the multienzyme system because alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate allosterically inhibit malate dehydrogenase and dissociate this enzyme from the multienzyme system.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAconitases are iron-sulfur hydrolyases {{catalysing}} the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate in a {{wide variety}} of organisms. Eukaryotic aconitases have been assigned additional roles, as in the case of the metazoan dual activity cytosolic aconitase-iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP 1). This human protein was produced in yeast mitochondria to probe IRP 1 folding in this organelle where iron-sulfur synthesis originates. The behaviour of human IRP 1 was compared with that of genuine mitochondrial (yeast or human) aconitases. All enzymes were functional in yeast mitochondria, but IRP 1 was found to form dense particles as detected by electron microscopy. MS analysis of purified inclusion bodies evidenced the presence of human IRP 1 and <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> complex component 1 (KGD 1), one of the subunits of <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> KGD 1 triggered formation of the mitochondrial aggregates, because the latter were absent in a KGD 1 (-) mutant, but it did not efficiently do so in the cytosol. Despite the iron-binding capacity of IRP 1 and the readily synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondria, the dense particles were not iron-rich, as indicated by elemental analysis of purified mitochondria. The data show that proper folding of dual activity IRP 1 -cytosolic aconitase is deficient in mitochondria, in contrast to genuine mitochondrial aconitases. Furthermore, efficient clearance of the aggregated IRP 1 -KGD 1 complex does not occur in the organelle, which emphasizes the role of molecular interactions in determining the fate of IRP 1. Thus, proper folding of human IRP 1 strongly depends on its cellular environment, in contrast to other members of the aconitase family...|$|R

The model studies indicate that the activity of PDC, as found for KGDC, is influenced by redundancies and random processes, which we describe as a multiple random coupling mechanism. In both complexes more than one lipoyl moiety services each pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 4. 1) or <b>alpha-ketoglutarate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (EC 1. 2. 4. 2) (E 1) subunit, and an extensive lipoyl-lipoyl interaction network for exchange of electrons and possibly acyl groups must also be present. The best fit between computed and experimental data for PDC was obtained with a model that has four lipoyl domains with four or, more probably, eight lipoyl moieties servicing each E 1 subunit. The lipoyl-lipoyl interaction network for PDC has lipoyl domain interactions {{similar to those found}} for KGDC plus the additional possibility of interaction of a lipoyl moiety and its paired mate on each dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 12) (E 2) subunit. The two lipoyl moieties on an E 2 subunit in PDC appear to be functionally indistinguishable, each servicing the acetyltransferase site of that E 2 subunit and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1. 6. 4. 3) (E 3) subunit if the latter is bound to that particular E 2 subunit. The observed difference between inactivation of PDC by lipoamidase and by trypsin appears to be due to dead-end competitive inhibition by lipoyl domains that have been modified by excision of lipoyl moieties by lipoamidase...|$|R
