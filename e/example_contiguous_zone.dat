40|$|In November 2015 Poland {{established}} a <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> and, {{after more than}} a year, in January 2017, adopted the regulation on the baselines, an external boundary of the Polish territorial sea and the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> of the Republic of Poland. After many decades, it was a successful attempt to establish a <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> returning to the concept of the 30 ’s of the last century. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) recognizes that the coastal State may establish a <b>zone</b> <b>contiguous</b> to its territorial sea that extends to 24 nautical miles from the baselines of the coastal State, known as the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone,</b> and exercise the control necessary to prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea, or to punish such infringements committed within its territory or territorial sea. This paper presents a few general comments on the Polish <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> taking into account the international roots of that legal institution of the law of the sea, of such importance, also for the security reasons...|$|R

40|$|The <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> is {{notorious for}} being the most poorly defined {{international}} maritime zone. Confusion about exactly what enforcement operations can lawfully be conducted by coastal States against foreign ships in the zone has existed from its creation in 1958. Uncertainty about the full legal character of the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> has long been recognised as a shortcoming, leading to it being the most poorly utilised maritime zone by coastal States {{with little more than}} half of the 167 States Parties to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) claiming the zone. The most difficult aspect about the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> is the scope of the unique preventative powers that may be exercised by coastal States within it, which are limited to four ill-defined topic areas in Article 33 of LOSC (customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary). This chapter examines the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> and considers the extent to which it can be utilised by coastal States for environmental protection purposes. A complication in determining the potential utility of the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> to assist coastal States to combat environmental threats and in encouraging State practice to develop in this regard, is that the zone overlaps the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), in which coastal States have ability to engage in activities to protect and preserve the maritime environment. The key issue is whether the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> powers enable a fuller suite of actions to be taken in order to protect the environmental interests of the coastal State...|$|R

40|$|The Kircaoglu and Sanaga case (Italian Court of Cassation, first {{criminal}} section, Judgment of 8 September 2010, No. 32960) {{concerned the}} capture by the Italian military vessel {{of a ship}} flying the Turkish flag in waters beyond the Italian territorial sea. The vessel was suspected of smuggling people {{in violation of the}} Italian law on immigration. The capture of the vessel took place after a hot pursuit commenced, in the view of Italian authorities, when the foreign ship was within the Italian <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone.</b> In this judgment, the Court of cassation addressed the issue of a State’s jurisdiction over the acts committed a foreign vessel in the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone.</b> The Court held the view that Italy does not have jurisdiction over acts committed within its national <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> by ships flying the flag of a State which is not a Contracting party of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10 December 1982. The decision is of particular interest because of it sheds lights on issues such as whether a State can have a <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> {{in the absence of a}} formal proclamation, and whether article 33 of UNCLOS on <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> reflects a rule of general international law...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> is a band {{of water}} {{extending}} from {{the outer edge of}} the territorial sea to up to [...] from the baseline, within which a state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing [...] "infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea". This will typically be [...] wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone.</b> However, unlike the territorial sea, there is no standard rule for resolving such conflicts and the states in question must negotiate their own compromise. The United States invoked a <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone</b> out to 24 nmi on 29 September 1999.|$|R
