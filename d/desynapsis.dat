40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to compare the megasporogenesis in a clone of Norway spruce with an ordinary seed set and a clone of a reduced seed set. The early prophase I stages had the same appearance in both clones. During the last part of diplotene there was a separation of the bivalents (i. e. <b>desynapsis</b> occurred) in the clone with the reduced seed set. During metaphase I-anaphase I 97 per cent of the embryo sac mother cells from the desynaptic clone contained at least one univalent. As a consequence of the occurrence of univalents micronuclei and other irregularities were observed during subsequent stages. Frequently the irregularities caused a degeneration of the cells. Thus, it was proved that the <b>desynapsis</b> was responsible for the poor seed set in the desynaptic clone of Norway spruce...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of balanced fertile haploid gametes requires the faithful separation of paired (synapsed) chromosomes {{toward the end}} of meiotic prophase I (<b>desynapsis).</b> This involves the timely dissolution of the synaptonemal complex during the pachytene-diplotene transition, a stage traditionally referred to as the "diffuse stage. " In species with large genomes such as, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) we know most about the early stages of meiotic prophase I. There, synapsis initiates at the telomeric ends of chromosomes and progresses toward the centromeric regions through the ordered assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Synapsis is impacted by recombination (crossing over, CO) which locally modifies the extent of chromatin compaction and extension. CO is uneven along the chromosomes, occurring mainly toward the telomeric regions resulting in a highly skewed distribution of recombination events. However, we know very little about the process of <b>desynapsis</b> which occurs during the "diffuse stage," where the synapsed and recombined chromosomes faithfully desynapse and separate into daughter cells. Here, using 3 D-SIM super-resolution immuno-cytology combined with the use of antibodies directed against two crucial SC proteins, ASY 1 and ZYP 1, we followed the whole of meiosis I (i. e., both synapsis and <b>desynapsis)</b> in both barley and wheat. We showed that synapsis forms a characteristic tri-partite SC structure in zygotene (more clearly seen in barley). Toward the end of meiosis I, as the SC starts to disassemble, we show that extensive chromosome axis remodeling results in the formation of characteristic "tinsel-like" structures in both wheat and barley. By using amutant (des 10) that is severely compromised in polymerization of ZYP 1 during synapsis, we show that tinsel structure formation during SC dissolution is not dependant on full synapsis and may relate instead to changes in expansion stress. Our observations highlight a potentially new role for ASYNAPSIS 1 (ASY 1) in <b>desynapsis,</b> in addition to chromosome synapsis and cohesion...|$|E

40|$|The forage grass species Brachiaria humidicola is {{native to}} African savannas. Owing to its good {{adaptation}} to poorly drained and infertile acid soils, it has achieved wide utilization for pastures in Brazilian farms. Among the 55 accessions of B. humidicola analysed from the Embrapa Beef Cattle collection, one (H 022), presented <b>desynapsis</b> and an abnormal pattern of cytokinesis in the first meiotic division. Among 28 inflorescences analysed in this accession, 12 were affected by the anomaly. In affected meiocytes, the first cytokinesis occurred in metaphase I and was generally perpendicular to a wide-metaphase plate, dividing the genome into two parts with an equal or unequal number of chromosomes. The normal cytokinesis after telophase I did not occur, and the meiocytes entered metaphase II, progressing {{to the end of}} meiosis with the occurrence of the second cytokinesis. As the first cytokinesis occurred precociously, whereas the second was normal, tetrads were formed but with unbalanced chromosome numbers in microspores. Abnormal cytokinesis occurred only in those meiocytes that underwent <b>desynapsis</b> after diakinesis. The implications of this abnormality in the Brachiaria breeding programme are discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} family in which {{azoospermia}} and infertility affected two sibs whose parents were first cousins once removed. Meiotic cells of the proband, who had the chromosomal complement of a normal male (46,XY), exhibited asynapsis, defective synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, chiasma failure, and degeneration of prophase spermatocytes with asynapsis. Based on these observations, we suggest that the meiotic abnormalities and infertility in this family comprise a trait with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Review of published cases of infertile men with normal chromosomal complements and disturbed meiosis suggests that genetically determined asynapsis and <b>desynapsis</b> similar to that established in plant and insect species also occur in humans. In humans, asynapsis appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive. The mode of inheritance of <b>desynapsis</b> is not clear; X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant has been suggested in one family. Studies by us and by others {{reported in the literature}} suggest that the mode of action of genes that affect synapsis and cause a reduction in the numbers of visible chiasmata at diakinesis is dissimilar to that of the action of genes that cause defective meiotic recombination, defective repair of induced damage to DNA in somatic cells, and chromosome instability...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of wheat cytogenetics, {{chromosome}} 3 B {{has been known to}} harbor a gene(s) that, when removed, causes chromosome <b>desynapsis</b> and gametic sterility. The lack of natural genetic diversity for this gene(s) has prevented any attempt to fine map and further characterize it. Here, gamma radiation treatment was used to create artificial diversity for this locus. A total of 696 radiation hybrid lines were genotyped with a custom mini array of 140 DArT markers, selected to evenly span the whole 3 B chromosome. The resulting map spanned 2, 852 centi Ray with a calculated resolution of 0. 384 Mb. Phenotyping for the occurrence of meiotic <b>desynapsis</b> was conducted by measuring the level of gametic sterility as seeds produced per spikelet and pollen viability at booting. Composite interval mapping revealed a single QTL with LOD of 16. 2 and r (2) of 25. 6 % between markers wmc 326 and wPt- 8983 on the long arm of chromosome 3 B. By independent analysis, the location of the QTL was confirmed to be within the deletion bin 3 BL 7 - 0. 63 - 1. 00 and to correspond to a single gene located similar to 1. 4 Mb away from wPt- 8983. The meiotic behavior of lines lacking this gene was characterized cytogenetically to reveal striking similarities with mutants for the dy locus, located on the syntenic chromosome 3 of maize. This represents the first example to date of employing radiation hybrids for QTL analysis. The success achieved by this approach provides an ideal starting point for the final cloning of this interesting gene involved in meiosis of cereals...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTelomere {{clustering}} is {{a widespread}} phenomenon among eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate formation of telomere clustering in mammalian meiotic prophase I, are still largely unknown. Here, we show that CDK 2, especially p 39 cdk 2, as a potential meiosis-specific connector interaction with SUN 1 mediates formation of telomere clustering during mouse meiosis. The transition from CDK 2 to p-CDK 2 also regulates the progression from homologous recombination to <b>desynapsis</b> by interacting with MLH 1. In addition, disappearance of CDK 2 on the telomeres and of p-CDK 2 on recombination sites, were observed in Sun 1 −/− mice and in pachytene-arrested hybrid sterile mice (pwk×C 57 BL/ 6 F 1), respectively.

40|$|Interlocked bivalents at ist meiotic {{metaphase}} are relatively uncommon in spermatocytes of the newt Triturus vttlgaris, but their {{frequency of occurrence}} can be significantly increased by subjecting newts to a 24 -h heat shock. Newt spermatocytes are sensitive to a heat shock at any stage {{between the end of}} premeiotic S and mid to late pachytene. The heat shock does not cause evident <b>desynapsis,</b> nor does it significantly affect chiasma frequency; therefore the interlocked condition induced in spermatocytes which were subjected to a heat shock when they were in zygotene or pachytene is unlikely to be a consequence of synaptic trapping. By way of explanation it is suggested that a heat shock may cause telomeres to detach from the nuclear membrane, or from the synaptonemal complex where the latter is attached to the membrane, thus allowing non-homologous chromonemata to become intertwined before chiasmata have formed. If this explanation is valid, it is then further suggested that the re-combination process which results in chiasma formation probably takes place in chromosomal regions lying outside the synaptonemal complex, rather than inside, between its 2 lateral elements...|$|E
40|$|Hybrids {{combining}} desirable traits from divergent {{parents are}} the main objective of some Brachiaria (Syn. Urochloa P. Beauv.) breeding programs. There is great interest {{in the development of}} apomictic hybrid cultivars that combine desirable genes such as resistance to spittlebugs, high nutritive value, and tolerance to acid soils. Microsporogenesis of six apomictic progenies resulting from a tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 36) cross between B. ruziziensis × B. brizantha was evaluated under light microscopy. Genetic recombination, ensured by multivalent chromosome association and crossing-over at prophase occurred in low frequency among progenies, and in one, recombination was almost nonexistent. The percentage of meiocytes with meiotic abnormalities among progenies ranged from 16. 6 % to 85. 6 %. Besides an observed irregular chromosome segregation typical of polyploid hybrids in these five progenies, putative meiotic mutations characterized as <b>desynapsis</b> and divergent spindle organization occurred in three progenies. These anomalies caused frequent fractionation of the genome into several microspores of different sizes. In Brachiaria, new cultivars must be apomictic to fix the genotype. However, Brachiaria is a pseudogamous apomict, and viable gametes are necessary to produce viable seeds.

40|$|The {{nucleus of}} spermatocytes {{provides}} {{during the first}} meiotic prophase an interesting model for investigating relationships of the nuclear envelope (NE) with components of the nuclear interior. During the pachytene stage, meiotic chromosomes are synapsed via synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and attached through both ends to the nuclear periphery. This association is dynamic because chromosomes move {{during the process of}} synapsis and <b>desynapsis</b> that takes place during meiotic prophase. The NE of spermatocytes possesses some peculiarities (e. g., lower stability than in somatic cells, expression of short meiosis-specific lamin isoforms called C 2 and B 3) that could be critically involved in this process. For better understanding of the association of chromosomes with the nuclear periphery, in the present study we have investigated the distribution of NE proteins in relation to SC attachment sites. A major outcome was the finding that lamin C 2 is distributed in the form of discontinuous domains at the NE of spermatocytes and that SC attachment sites are embedded in these domains. Lamin C 2 appears to form part of larger structures as suggested by cell fractionation experiments. According to these results, we propose that the C 2 -containing domains represent local reinforcements of the NE that are involved in the proper attachment of SCs...|$|E
40|$|A {{completely}} male-sterile, female-sterile mutant {{was derived}} from tissue culture of cv. Calland. The primary goal was to identify its inheritance, allelism, and cytology. Calland sterile (TC) was nonallelic with st 2, st 3, st 4, and st 5 female-sterile and malesterile mutants. In all crosses, except st 5, single-gene recessive inheritance was documented. Critical ratios, 15 fertile: 1 sterile (for two loci) and 45 fertile: 19 sterile (for three loci), were observed in the F 2 families from the cross of heterozygous Calland TC andSt 5 st 5. F 3 segregation data confirmed the duplicate factor inheritance of Calland TC. Calland TC was designated St 6 st 6 st 7 st 7 and assigned the genetic type collection number T 331 H. The mutant was studied for abnormalities during microsporogenesis. The first abnormality was the occurrence of hollow-core nucleoli in sporogenous mass cells. During anaphase I and anaphase II of meiosis, lagging chromosomes and unequal chromosome segregation were observed, resulting in numerically and genetically unbalanced microspore nuclei. This also resulted in four microspores, and in five to eight microspores held together by common callose walls. Dissolution of callose released microspores into locules. Most microspores enlarged and were surrounded by microspore/pollen walls. After microspore mitosis, most young pollen grains degenerated. No viable pollen grains were evident.

40|$|In most sexually {{reproducing}} organisms, {{the fundamental}} process of meiosis is implemented concurrently with two differentiation programs that occur {{at different rates}} and generate distinct cell types, sperm and oocytes. However, {{little is known about}} how the meiotic program is influenced by such contrasting developmental programs. Here we present a detailed timeline of late meiotic prophase during spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans using cytological and molecular landmarks to interrelate changes in chromosome dynamics with germ cell cellularization, spindle formation, and cell cycle transitions. This analysis expands our understanding C. elegans spermatogenesis, as it identifies multiple spermatogenesis-specific features of the meiotic program and provides a framework for comparative studies. Postpachytene chromatin of spermatocytes is distinct from that of oocytes in both composition and morphology. Strikingly, C. elegans spermatogenesis includes a previously undescribed karyosome stage, a common but poorly understood feature of meiosis in many organisms. We find that karyosome formation, in which chromosomes form a constricted mass within an intact nuclear envelope, follows <b>desynapsis,</b> involves a global down-regulation of transcription, and may support the sequential activation of multiple kinases that prepare spermatocytes for meiotic divisions. In spermatocytes, the presence of centrioles alters both the relative timing of meiotic spindle assembly and its ultimate structure.

40|$|Meiosis is {{the process}} by which a germ cell becomes a haploid gamete. During {{prophase}} I of meiosis, DNA replication produces homologous chromosome pairs. The formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) between chromosome pairs initiates the evolutionarily essential step of meiotic recombination. Surprisingly, the regulation of DSB formation remains largely unknown. The protein High Incidence of Males 5 (HIM- 5) and X non-disjunction factor 1 (XND- 1) are two germ line proteins found in C. elegans, and the lab of Phil Meneely is utilizing HIM- 5 and XND- 1 to study DSB formation during meiosis I. In wild-type (WT) C. elegans, male progeny (XO genotype) typically compose 0. 2 % of the offspring. However, the him- 5 and xnd- 1 mutant phenotype display a high frequency of male progeny, approximately 40 % or 20 % of the offspring, respectfully. Both mutant phenotypes can be recovered via X-ray irradiation, which induces DSBs externally. Thus, both HIM- 5 and XND- 1 appear to be critical for directing DSB formation to the X chromosome. Through a detailed examination of these proteins, I will attempt to elucidate the causes of severe <b>desynapsis</b> of the X during late pachytene, delayed DSB repair, the inability of xnd- 1 and him- 5 from directing DSBs to the X, and the role of H 2 AK 5 ac during meiosis.

Cytological analysis at diakinesis, metaphase I (MI), anaphase I (AI) and telophase I (TI) however, revealed that lacking of pairing between species chromosomes. At diakinesis and MI, almost all hybrid pollen mother cells (PMCs) had 24 univalents (I) resulted into marked reduction in chiasma frequency/PMC in comparison to their respective parents. The chiasmata/hybrid PMC was ranged from 1. 33 ± 1. 06 – 2. 57 ± 2. 20. The frequency of bridges, laggards and bridges + laggards was very high in AI and TI.

40|$|In the rat ovary, germ {{and somatic}} cells become {{organized}} into primordial follicles 48 - 72 h after birth. Although several genes have {{been implicated in}} the control of early follicular growth, less {{is known about the}} factors involved in the formation of primordial follicles. Using the method of differential display of mRNAs, we found several genes differentially expressed at the time of follicular assembly. One of them encodes synaptonemal complex protein- 1 (SCP 1), a core component of the protein complex that maintains recombining chromosomes together during prophase I of the first meiotic division in germ cells. This association, evident during the pachytene stage, ends when chromosomal <b>desynapsis</b> begins in the diplotene stage at the end of prophase I. Oocytes become arrested in the diplotene/dictate stage before becoming enclosed into primordial follicles, suggesting that oocytes must complete meiotic prophase I before becoming competent to direct follicle assembly. We now show that attainment of the diplotene stage results in follicular formation. In developing rat ovaries, SCP 1 mRNAexpression is confined to oocytes and decreases precipitously within 24 h after birth, preceding the organization of primordial follicles. The premature loss of SCP 1, achieved via treatment with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting SCP 1 mRNA, resulted in more oocytes reaching the diplotene stage, as evidenced by a {{decrease in the number of}} oocytes containing germ cell nuclear antigen- 1 (a nuclear protein whose expression ceases in diplotene) and an increase in the number of oocytes expressing MSY 2 (a cytoplasmic Y box protein expressed in oocytes that have become arrested in diplotene). SCP 1 -deficient ovaries exhibited an increased number of newly formed follicles, suggesting that completion of meiotic prophase I endows oocytes with the ability to orchestrate follicular assembly...|$|E
40|$|Crosses between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bulbous barleygrass (H. bulbosum) {{could be}} {{valuable}} {{for the transfer}} of such properties as resistance to cold or diseases from H. bulbosum to H. vulgare. From the literature it was known that difficulties arose in the cross: seed abortion necessitating culture of the hybrid embryo, sterility of the hybrids, and all the viable hybrids mentioned in the literature were triploid. The purpose of my study was to enlarge knowledge of these interspecific crosses, and to try and solve the difficulties. For convenience parents and hybrids were denoted by genome symbols, e. g. VV = H. vulgare (2 x), BB = H. bulbosum (2 x). The results below are arranged as in the chapters. Crossing and the hybrids All eight possible crosses between diploid and autotetraploid cytotypes of the two species were tried. The direction of the cross, the parents and environmental conditions seemed to influence its success. Both crosses between VV and BB yielded three haploid plants with the genome V and six diploid hybrids. The haploids {{and two of the}} hybrids died before flowering. The cross VV x BBBB was most successful: one haploid plant with the genome V and 145 triploid hybrids, of which 13 died before flowering. The reciprocal cross yielded 12 triploid hybrids. Both crosses between VVVV and BB were unsuccessful, whereas the two crosses between VVVV and BBBB produced 18 dihaploids with the genome VV and 16 plants with more than 14 chromosomes and hybrid characteristics. Of the dihaploids nine died before flowering and of the hybrids six (tables 2 to 6). All the hybrids resembled one another and were almost sterile (tables 7 and 8). Their general form was that of H. bulbosum, although they were not so large and vigorous. Chromosome number was usually unstable in the tetraploid hybrids; from one of them a diploid hybrid arose, presumably by gradual elimination of chromosomes, while six of the plants formed tillers, usually fertile, resembling H. vulgare. The progeny of these tillers were diploid {{with the exception of one}} which yielded diploid and tetraploid plants, presumably by spontaneous doubling up of the chromosomes. The dihaploid plants closely resembled diploid H. vulgare and were fertile. They and the haploid must have arisen by elimination of chromosomes. Later generations from dihaploids and from fertile tillers of tetraploid hybrids were compared with H. vulgare. Progeny with cytoplasm of H. vulgare (from the cross VVVV x BBBB) differed slightly from diploid H. vulgare, probably because the genetic constitution of the two sets of chromosomes derived from the tetraploid is no longer identical with that of the diploid variety of barley. Offspring of dihaploids with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum (from the cross BBBB x VVVV differed more because there would be a cytoplasmic effect as well as the genetic effect (table 9). Embryology Development of the caryopsis from the crosses VV x BB, VV x BB 13 B and VVVV x BBBB was compared with intravarietal fertilization VV x VV. All parts of the caryopsis developed slower in interspecific crosses. Seed of the crosses VV x BB and VVVV x BBBB usually aborted within two weeks of pollination before any organs of the embryo had differentiated. Seed of VV x BBBB aborted within three or four weeks after organs of the embryo had started differentiating abnormally. From early in development all interspecific crosses showed abnormalities in division of cells and nuclei in the endosperm. Besides many micronuclei, there were multinuclear cells and giant nuclei which arose by endomitosis or by nuclear fusion in the multinuclear cells followed by endomitosis. The abnormal endosperm degenerated, thus appearing to be the primary cause of seed abortion. In the hybrid embryo abnormalities were detected, from which micronuclei arose. They appeared later than in the endosperm and seemed not to be the direct cause of abortion of the embryo, even though they affect its vitality. In the hybrid crosses the antipodal cells remained intact slightly longer than in the intravarietal cross and occasionally some cells remained intact much longer, giving rise to enormous giant nuclei, perhaps by endomitosis. The maternal tissue in the hybrid crosses developed initially as in the intravarietal cross but more slowly. Seed abortion certainly curtailed this early. Cytogenetics The karyotypes of parental species, hybrids and various other progeny were described and compared, to see whether there was any change in chromosomal morphology and to find the chromosomal composition of plants after vegetative elimination of chromosomes. Amphiplasty occurred in the hybrid so that satellites of the H. bulbosum genome were not visible as such. The relative lengths of the chromosomes within a genome were not affected by hybridization and the ratio of lengths between the genomes of H. vulgare and H. bulbosum were about the same in all hybrids. The karyotypes obtained by vegetative elimination of chromosomes were entirely as expected (tables 12 to 22). The maximum number of nucleoli per cell of vegetative tissue corresponded with the number of satellite chromosomes except in some cells of triploid hybrids. The average number of nucleoli per cell was in diploids and triploids much larger and in tetraploids slightly larger than expected from the number in H. vulgare. Thus the presence of chromosomes of H. bulbosum increased the number of nucleoli per cel (table 23 and figure 26). In all types of hybrid, chromosomes paired completely or almost completely during the pachytene stage of meiosis, by which allosyndetic, non-homologous autosyndetic and homologous autosyndetic pairing occurred simultaneously. Then some associations of chromosomes fell apart by <b>desynapsis</b> which was a result of low chiasma frequency. The other chromosomes remained joined by chiasmata or pseudochiasmata, which could hardly be distinguished from each other. In diploid hybrids most seemed to be pseudochiasmata and they sometimes lasted until the first anaphase. In the triploids most normal chiasmata gave rise to association of chromosomes in the first metaphase, while in tetraploids both types occurred together but with fewer pseudochiasmata than normal chiasmata (tables 24, 25, 28, 29, and 31). In all types of hybrid there were one or rarely two nucleoli per cell during prophase and diakinesis of meiosis. The nucleolus was associated with two chromosomes or chromosomal configurations at most. In diploids and tetraploids and to a lesser extent in triploids there were aneuploid cells, chiefly hypoploid. Many cells contained various inclusions; hypoploid cells contained the most. The inclusions and the aneuploidy could be ascribed to abnormal premeiotic division in which not all the chromosomes were distributed between the daughter cells (tables 26 and 32). Association of chromosomes was studied in the first metaphase of aneuploid cells. In diploid hybrids, association decreased rapidly in hypoploid cells with declining chromosome number. In triploid hybrids this decrease was less marked and in cells with about 14 chromosomes association reached the rate found in the diploid hybrids, suggesting that it was chiefly the chromosomes of H. bulbosum which had been eliminated. In tetraploid hybrids association decreased rapidly until chromosome number reached 24 and then decreased slower slightly above the rate of association found in aneuploid cells of triploids. This indicates that there is some selectivity in the elimination of chromosomes, whereby the chromosomes of H. bulbosum stand more chance of being eliminated (figure 33). Because of univalents, pseudochiasmata and aneuploidy, meiosis was very irregular from the first metaphase. The tetrads contained micronuclei and pollen micrograins. Ripe anthers of diploid hybrids contained no stainable grains; triploids contained little stainable grains and they were of variable diameter; in tetraploids there was a proportion of stainable grains which varied between plants and grain diameter was very variable (tables 27, 30 and 34). In the haploid plant with the genome V there was a slight tendency to form bivalents in meiosis, but they mostly proved to be pseudobivalents. Dihaploids with the genome VV all had very regular meiosis similar to that of diploid H. vulgare. The pollen of these plants was identical with that of diploid H. vul gare (tables 33 and 34). Discussion Many of the abnormalities seem to be caused by faulty division of nuclei containing chromosomes from both H. vulgare and H. bulbosum. They included the abnormal development of endosperm, lack of vigour in the hybrid embryo and plant, vegetative elimination of chromosomes, and- the occurrence of aneuploid pollen mother cells. The abnormalities could be the result of incompatibility between chromosomes or genes of the parental species. The observed differences in the amount and nature of abnormalities in several tissues probably ensue from existing differences between the tissues, e. g. in speed of mitoses, and by differences in gene dosage. Another abnormality in the hybrid nucleus is amphiplasty, which was expressed as the suppression of the secondary constriction in the satellite chromosome of H. bulbosum and probably caused the suppression of nucleolus activity in the same chromosome. This abnormality is perhaps associated with the preferential elimination of the chromosomes of H. bulbosum. Finally there are abnormalities in meiosis: besides aneuploidy, there are <b>desynapsis</b> as a result of low chiasma frequency and formation of pseudochiasmata. The low chiasma frequency probably is genetically determined, while the pseudochiasmata might be the result of matrix connections or fusion of heterochromatin. The significance of the hybrids for barley breeding is briefly considered. As it is likely that in meiosis material is exchanged between chromosomes of the two parents and as the hybrids are not completely sterile, it may be possible to introduce characteristics of H. bulbosum into H. vulgare. In somatic tissue characteristics could be transferred by induction of interspecific translocations, for example in tetraploid hybrids, after which the preferential elimination of chromosomes could be used to recover changed genomes of H. vulgare. Perhaps hexaploid hybrids VVBBBB could be used. Plants with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum and the chromosomes of H. vulgare could be of interest for breeding frost-resistant barley and in the study of male-sterile barley. The possibilities deserve further research...|$|E
40|$|Akodon molinae (with 2 n = 42 - 43 - 44 and an FN = 44) shows a {{remarkable}} polymorphism of chromosome 1 in natural and laboratory populations. Specimens 2 n = 42, named single homozygotes (SH), have a chromosome pair 1 formed by two large metacentric chromosomes. Specimens 2 n = 3, heterozygotes (Ht), have one chromosome 1 and two medium-sized subtelocentric chromosomes, 1 a and 1 b, which are homologous {{with the long}} and short arms of chromosome 1 respectively. Specimens 2 n = 44 are double homozygotes (DH), with just two pairs of medium-sized subtelocentric chromosomes, 1 a and 1 b. Analysis of meiotic metaphases I and II showed that anomalous segregation occurs more frequently in spermatocytes carrying the 1 a and 1 b chromosomes. This would disturb gametogenesis and other reproductive and developmental processes, producing a marked decrease in viability of DH individuals. There is, as yet, no satisfactory explanation for these phenomena. To investigate structural elements which might explain such segregational anomalies, we have studied bivalent and trivalent synapsis in pachytene spermatocytes from SH, Ht and DH specimens. Of a total of 80 spermatocyte nuclei microspreads, the following results were obtained: of 16 microspreads from two SH individuals, 20 autosomic bivalents plus the XY bivalent were observed; of 48 microspreads from three Ht individuals, 19 autosomic bivalents, 1 trivalent and an XY bivalent were seen; and of the 16 microspreads from two DH individuals, 21 autosomic bivalents plus the XY bivalent were found. Trivalents analysed showed complete pairing between the short arms of 1 a and 1 b, and having an apparently normal synaptonemal complex (SC) with lengths of 1 and 2. 8 µm. The trivalent SC showed three telomeric ends, corresponding to arms: q 1 and q 1 a; p 1 and q 1 b; and p 1 a and p 1 b, with attachment plates to the nuclear envelope of normal organisation. None of the trivalents showed asynapsis or <b>desynapsis</b> between p 1 a and p 1 b, nor an association with the XY bivalent. In 70 % of spermatocytes studied, the XY bivalent showed complete pairing between X and Y, with SC formation along the whole length of the Y chromosome. The remaining 30 % showed partial pairing, with an SC length which varied from the common end. Based on these findings and those of previous studies, we discuss: 1. - that the obliged configuration of the trivalent, with SC formation between the short arms of 1 a and 1 b, helps to assure a quasi normal segregation between 1, 1 a and 1 b in anaphase I of Ht meiosis; and 2. - that co-existence in trivalents of chromosomes 1, 1 a and 1 b in Ht individuals, breaks down the structural and functional integrity of the short arms of 1 a and 1 b, producing an accumulative damage which would also explain the decreased viability of individuals bearing these chromosomes Akodon molinae con 2 n = 42 - 43 - 44 y FN = 44 presenta un notable polimorfismo en el cromosoma 1 en poblaciones naturales y de laboratorio, los individuos 2 n = 42 tienen un par 1 formado por dos cromosomas metacéntricos grandes y son denominados homocigotos simples (SH); los individuos 2 n = 43, heterocigotos (Ht), presentan un cromosoma 1 y dos cromosomas subtelocéntricos de tamaño medio 1 a and 1 b, que son homólogos con los brazos largo y corto del 1, respectivamente; y los individuos 2 n = 44 que son los doble homocigotos (DH) y presentan dos pares de cromosomas subtelocéntricos 1 a y 1 b. Análisis de la metafases I y II meióticas han demostrado que se producen segregaciones anómalas con una alta frecuencia en los espermatocitos portadores de los cromosomas 1 a and 1 b. Ello alteraría a otros procesos, como la gametogénesis, la reproducción y el desarrollo, disminuyendo la viabilidad individual y poblacional de los DH. No ha habido una explicación satisfactoria para estos fenómenos. Para investigar elementos estructurales que pudiesen explicar tales alteraciones segregacionales, se estudió la sinapsis de bivalentes y trivalentes en espermatocitos en paquiteno de ejemplares SH, Ht y DH. De un total de 80 microesparcidos de núcleos de espermatocitos: en 16 núcleos de ejemplares SH se observaron 20 bivalentes autosómicos más el bivalente XY; en 48 núcleos de Ht se observaron 19 bivalentes autosómicos, 1 trivalente y un bivalente XY; y en 16 núcleos de DH se observaron 21 bivalentes autosómicos más el bivalente XY. Los trivalentes analizados mostraron apareamiento completo entre los brazos cortos de 1 a y 1 b conformándose un complejo sinaptonémico (CS) aparentemente normal con una longitud entre 1 µm y 2, 8 µm. El CS de los trivalentes presentó tres extremos teloméricos correspondientes a los brazos: q 1 y q 1 a, p 1 y q 1 b y p 1 a y p 1 b, con placas de inserción a la envoltura nuclear de organización normal. En ninguno de los trivalentes se observó asinapsis o desinapsis entre p 1 a y p 1 b, ni asociaciones con el bivalente XY. En el 70 % de los espermatocitos estudiados el bivalente XY mostró apareamiento completo entre X e Y, con formación de CS en toda la longitud del cromosoma Y. El 30 % restante presentó apareamiento parcial con un CS de longitud variable a partir del extremo común. Sobre la base de los resultados de este trabajo y los antecedentes existentes, se discute: 1. - que la configuración obligada del trivalente con formación de CS entre los brazos cortos de 1 a y 1 b, contribuye a asegurar la segregación cuasi normal entre 1, 1 a y 1 b en la I anafase de la meiosis de los Ht; y 2. - que la coexistencia en los trivalentes de los cromosomas 1, 1 a y 1 b en los Ht, erosiona la integridad estructural y funcional de los brazos cortos de 1 a y 1 b, daño que sería acumulativo y que explicaría la viabilidad disminuída de los individuos portadores de estos cromosoma...|$|E
