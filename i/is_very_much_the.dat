Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and <b>is,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine.

500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so when she talks about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E

Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard questioned why Ivan even returned to the village after his break.

Upon learning that Brocklebank was leaving the series, the Daily Mail's Carrie Fitton said that as [...] "the only bisexual binman in the village he had staying power".|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were not}} {{unanimous}} in their praise. The Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz felt that character was unoriginal, inaccurate and Westernized, writing, [...] " [...] costumes (particularly the kimono and obi Mulan wears to the Matchmaker) and hairdos look Japanese... Give Mulan Native American features {{and you have}} Pocahontas." [...] Similarly, James Berardinelli of ReelViews felt that the character's depiction was too [...] "familiar," [...] reviewing, [...] "Although she looks different from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same type of individual: {{a woman with a}} strong, independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental. The film isn't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between the sexes". Additionally, some critics, such as Alex von Tunzelmann of The Guardian, have criticized Mulan for her violence, writing, [...] "Disney struggles to make Mulan both a killer and a heroine... Gingerly, the film attempts to tread a middle path, implying that Mulan annihilates most of the Hun army by causing an avalanche, and having her dispatch Shan Yu with a load of fireworks. Very pretty. But still technically killing." [...] However, von Tunzelmann did conclude more positively, [...] "as Disney heroines go, Mulan herself is a clear improvement on the standard-issue drippy princess." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E

2500|$|Liability issues {{strongly}} {{affect the}} structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices – and this <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> case with buddy diving. [...] Diving is a risky sport, where very serious accidents will occasionally occur. In an increasingly litigious world, accidents trigger a search for “blame”, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a natural thing for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks. [...] Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks, and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of [...] creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided “duty of care” if an accident occurs. [...] This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.|$|E
2500|$|The narrowest {{definition}} would be: {{a system}} with unpaired spins that do not interact with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. Of course, the latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important {{and in the case}} of metallic gold it dominates the properties. Of course, the element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H2 and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (quenched), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore diamagnetic and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because f (especially 4f) orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. [...] Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.|$|E
2500|$|Heather Phares of Allmusic {{expressed}} that [...] "hile Conatus isn't as direct as Stridulum, it's still {{some of her}} most satisfying work. This is music made in and for the darkest hours, and a striking portrait of the times when crisis and opportunity meet." [...] Matt James of PopMatters described the album as [...] "enchanting, exhausting, cathartic, borderline traumatic, and curiously beautiful to its dying breath", adding that [...] "Conatus is an album rich with highlights. It's melodrama so operatic, everything's built to sound like the last song you'll ever hear." [...] Jen Long of BBC Music felt that the album is [...] "trademark Zola Jesus" [...] which hasn't [...] "taken any great strides away from the formula that's served its master so well to date" [...] and, while the production has certainly taken a step up, the lyrical content of songs prove to be less memorable than the delivery. Long concluded: [...] "This is a strong record, there's no doubting that—but it still feels like the best {{is yet to come}} from Danilova, which some may consider a disappointment now that she's three albums to the good." [...] Evan Hanlon of Dusted Magazine thought that [...] "he lyrical content is largely superfluous, and despite the obvious upgrade in production and a newfound embrace of the spotlight, the program <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same." [...] Praising [...] "Vessel" [...] and [...] "Seekir" [...] as the album's two most innovative tracks, Emily Mackay of NME concluded: [...] "Mostly, though, Conatus gives you a more polished version of exactly what you'd want from a Zola Jesus album". The Observers Kitty Empire found the album [...] "very accomplished, but lacking in variety".|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the years}} 1928-1932 he painted {{a group of}} {{paintings}} he called [...] "Stylized". In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere {{at the time in}} Florida. The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates. The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it. The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake. The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings. In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers. In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison. The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body. Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes. The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance of the little girl is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement. It is a unity of life's expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing. Another painting, Polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative Stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun. The pattern of the plant was echoed in the Polynesian tapa cloth which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background. The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form. The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form. The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce. Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style. The [...] "Philosophical" [...] series was started between 1932 and 1936. In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection. This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit. After this painting was completed, Mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated. The palm was confined. This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them {{up and out of the}} frame. He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934. He used elephants to move and plow the dirt. Being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes. His elephant painting reflects this insight. In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium. The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard. The appearance <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same. The leaves and flower in the painting represents the Aracae family, of which the calla lily is a member. They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants. The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles. The painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms. He described the motivation behind the Climbers. It had been motivated by a huge, old, gnarled vine growing outside his studio at Tropical Arts. The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air. A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine. It is the guide for its motivation. Likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places. The parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence. The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting. His series Impressions of Mexico was completed between 1936 and 1938.|$|E
