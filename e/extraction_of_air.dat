50|$|Inbicon {{utilizes}} a hydrothermal pretreatment process {{after the}} mechanical conditioning of the feedstock. The premise {{of this process}} is to produce a fibre fraction and a liquid fraction through an extraction using hot water. In the fibre fraction this process achieves greater than 80% of the lignin present in the initial feedstock. Whereas the liquid fraction contains: C5 sugars, alkali chlorides and fermentation inhibitors. The main fermentation inhibitor present is acetic acid. However, the fermentation inhibitors can later be removed through detoxification with NH3 at a feasible cost. Since this pretreatment process does not use acids or bases and only water it eliminates the need to extract pretreatment chemicals once completed.During the initial step of the hydrothermal pretreatment process the feedstock is soaked and simultaneously placed in temperatures of up to 100 °C and ambient pressure. This allows for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> present and saturates the feedstock with water. The next step entails a pressurized treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of 170 to 230 °C through the addition of hot water or steam for approximately 5-15 minutes. This pressurized treatment can be repeated at altered temperatures and pressures in different zones increasing each subsequent time, therefore, labeled as a counter-current process. The steam released during the hydrothermal pre-treatment process is collected and reused in downstream evaporation processes. Throughout the hydrothermal pretreatment, there are acids formed that causes the fibre fraction to be nearly neutral in pH. The main benefit of this is that the pH will have to barely be adjusted for enzymatic liquefaction.|$|E

40|$|Humidification {{dehumidification}} (HDH) desalination is {{a thermal}} driven desalination technology. One {{of the main}} issues with HDH desalination is the high energy consumption involved. The energy efficiency of thermal desalination systems is given by a non-dimensional number known as the gained output ratio (GOR) which is a ratio of the {{latent heat of evaporation}} of the water produced to the net heat input. In Lienhard Research Group at MIT, a particular method of increasing GOR has been invented. This method involves matching the heat capacity ratio (HCR) of the flows exchanging heat and mass to approach unity. Specifically, based on theoretical studies done previously in the group, it had been proposed that mass <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> from the humidification device to the dehumidification device changes the HCR favorably. This thesis looks to show the same experimentally. By making adjustments of the HCR {{in different parts of the}} process it is possible to increase the GOR substantially.

All mass extraction cases found an improved GOR value, confirming that this process reduces the total system irreversibility. by Victor Nevarez. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{explosive}} growing {{of earth}} observing data {{needs to have}} relative efficient data processing methods. This paper aims at the processing and analysis of large volume of vector field data acquiring from satellite derived, or model assimilation, an approach of fronts extraction from vector field data was proposed. The study {{is based on the}} assumption that the distribution of feature vectors for front and non-front are significantly different. A front is represented as a multi-dimensional feature space composed by a set of physical features acts as feature vectors. On the basis of the characteristics analysis of vector field data and the physical feature of fronts, a five-step front extraction process was illuminated in detail, including physical feature abstraction of target, physical features spatialization and multi-dimensional feature space construction, feature space segmentation, identification of possible front and postprocessing. By expert knowledge, speed, vorticity, and the direction variation of vector field were chosen as feature vectors, Fuzzy Clustering method is used to segment the feature space into several regions, and get the possible front. For the filtering of the candidate regions and the identification of possible front, principal components analysis and the domain knowledge were used, followed by a hierarchical threshold technique and other post processing techniques for the removing of false regions. To illuminate the application of the approach, the extraction of ocean front from ocean current field data was taken as an example. Experimental results show that the extracted fronts are in good agreement with the ones identified by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) image. Furthermore, the approach is universal for all kinds of front extraction from vector field data, including the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> fron...|$|E
40|$|A new {{electronically}} controlled pump {{has been}} developed for use with a cuirass in providing external negative pressure ventilation. It is smaller, lighter, and more versatile than currently available pumps and operates on a servo principle. A rotary valve between the pump and the cuirass varies the rate of <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> from the cuirass. The pressure within the cuirass is sensed by a pressure transducer, and the output of this is used to control {{the position of the}} rotary valve by means of a motor so that the pressure within the cuirass follows a predetermined half sine wave pattern. The respiratory rate varies from 10 to 30 per minute and the inspiratory to expiratory time (I/E) ratio from 3 : 2 to 2 : 3. Inspiratory pressure varies from 0 to - 50 cm H 2 O and an expiratory pressure of 0 to + 50 cm H 2 O can be imposed. The performance of the new pump was assessed in 21 patients with nocturnal hypoxaemia who were accustomed to external negative pressure ventilation. The mean tidal volume achieved increased with increase in cuirass suction pressure, and changing the I/E ratio from 1 : 1 to 3 : 2 produced a small increase at a cuirass negative pressure at 20 cm water. Comparison of the Newmarket pump with the Cape pump in 14 patients showed that similar tidal volumes were achieved. Overnight monitoring of cuirass pressure in one patient showed more even control of peak negative pressure with the Newmarket pump than with the Cape pump. Ten pumps are in use in patients' homes; five have been in service for more than six months and no important problems have been encountered.

40|$|The {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>air</b> bubbles {{trapped in}} ice from Antarctica and Greenland {{is one of}} the most important sources of information about the development of the atmospheric composition during the last 100. 000 years and its relation to the climate changes during this time. Consequently, the objective of this project was to develop a new technique for simultaneous determination of mixing ratios of CO_ 2, CH_ 4, N_ 2 O, and CO in air samples extracted from ice cores and to apply this technique to studies on different ice cores. The technique consists <b>of</b> three steps: <b>Extraction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> from the ice sample, transfer <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> into the absorption cuvette of the spectrometer, and the analysis by frequency modulated tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer (FM-TDLAS). The developed FM-TDLAS-spectrometer is capable to detect 2 ppbv CO, 22 ppbv CH_ 4, and 1 ppbv N_ 2 O in <b>air</b> sample <b>of</b> 2 cm" 3 (STP). This is sufficient to resolve the changes of mixing ratios of these gases and of CO_ 2, whose detection limit is much better than needed, during the last 100. 000 years. The development <b>of</b> the <b>extraction</b> techniques was focused on the sublimation of the ice sample. The air extracted by this technique was contaminated by all four gases and this has so far prevented a reliable determination of these gases.

The two-step method was tested on the SRM NIST 1648 for equivalence with two reference methods, the EMEP procedure for ions extraction and the EN 12341 standard for the elemental determination of the PM 10 and is suitable for application to small sample amounts (less than 1 mg of particulate matter is needed), i. e. those collected by daily low volume filter-sampling. Performance times of the procedure were optimised to meet the target of routine application for large scale monitoring samples. A single ultrasonic-assisted <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> particulate matter is performed in 0. 01 M acetate buffer at pH 4. 5, followed by IC ions analysis and ICP-OES elemental analysis of the extract and by ICP-OES elemental analysis of the mineralized residue after dissolution by microwave-assisted digestion with a HNO 3 /H 2 O 2 mixture. Using a pH buffered extracting solvent was preferred to water or diluted acid solutions to improve the reproducibility of metals extraction with respect to existing leaching methods; the influence of pH, nature and concentration of the buffer solution and extraction time on analytes concentration in the extract is discussed. Values of ions extraction and elements recoveries resulted fairly equivalent with those obtained by the reference methods. The study was also extended to some non-certified elements (Mg, S. Sb, Si and Ti) for their environmental significance. Elements recoveries were obtained as sum of the extract and residue fractions and were comparable with those obtained by direct dissolution.

40|$|In The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture, A. W. N. Pugin criticised the {{original}} competition entry for the Palace of Westminster for its classical character, {{but he also}} rejected the super cial or purely for- malist approach {{to the use of}} irregularity in Gothic Revival architecture, stressing that irregularly should always be a truthful out- ward of expression of internal arrangements or a building’s evolution. After 1840, however, the architectural form of the Palace was gradually modified to accommodate a stack ventilation system that had not been part of the early architectural scheme Pugin had criticised. Thee relationship between architectural form, composition and the functional requirements of the stack ventilation strategy became subject on extensive investigations, and the design development illuminates how this relationship manifested itself in the exterior of the Palace. Following the plans of the Scottish physician David Boswell Reid the existing architectural towers, such as the Clock and Victoria Towers, were converted into air supply shafts, while a third tower of equal architectural prominence was added for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> Reid saw the Palace as an opportunity to resolve questions of ventilation using a rational scienti c design approach, which he had previously deployed in the design of mock debating chambers but in the actual Palace, architectural and scientific questions had to be addressed in an integrated way, involving collaborations between engineers, scientists and the architect. Difficulties with achieving this level of collaboration and increasing doubts about the system’s technical viability 4 provided the impetus for adopting a fundamentally different ventilation strategy under Barry’s direc- tion. is not only significantly reduced the complexity of the design process, but for the second time, led to a transformation of the building’s architectural form. Remnants of the abandoned scheme, such as the Central Tower, were retained without fulfilling its original purpose, but a system of local ventilation turrets was gradually introduced between 1846 and 1854 to compensate for the loss of the Tower as a discharge. The Palace underwent a gradual architectural transformation in response to an evolving system of ventilation. Previous studies have focused on the ventilation as a technical issue, with- out investigating the relationship between architectural and technical inquiries during the design development. Based on a detailed study of {{the original}} project correspondence, sketches, architectural drawings, this chapter investigates how the architecture of the Palace was transformed in response to the evolving ventilation system. The archival evidence covered the involvement of Barry’s architectural practice in great detail, but unfortunately did not provide any insight into Pugin’s specific contribution to the develop- ment of the ventilation system. This chapter starts with the original competition scheme and how it was modified between 1840 and 1846 to accommodate Reid’s original plans. This is followed by an exploration ration of {{the development of a new}} strategy adopted a er 1846 under Barry’s direction. Major modifications implemented in 1854 by the engineer Goldsworthy Gurney represented the end of this intense negotiation process as the design remained largely unchanged until the 1880 s.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains one}} of the main causes of human death around the globe. The {{mortality}} rate for patients infected with active TB goes beyond 50 % when not diagnosed. Rapid and accurate diagnostics coupled with further prompt treatment of the disease is the cornerstone for controlling TB outbreaks. To reduce this burden, the existing gap between detection and treatment must be addressed, and dedicated diagnostic tools such as biosensors should be developed. A biosensor is a sensing micro-device that consists of a biological sensing element and a transducer part to produce signals in proportion to quantitative information about the binding event. The micro-biosensor cell considered in this investigation is designed to operate based on aptamers as recognition elements against Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted protein MPT 64, combined in a microfluidic-chamber with inlet and outlet connections. The microfluidic cell is a miniaturized platform with valuable advantages such as low cost of analysis with low reagent consumption, reduced sample volume, and shortened processing time with enhanced analytical capability. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the flooding characteristics of the encapsulated microfluidic cell of an existing micro-biosensor using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. The main challenge in the design of the microfluidic cell lies in the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> entrained <b>air</b> bubbles, which may remain after the filling process is completed, dramatically affecting the performance of the sensing element. In this work, a CFD model was developed on the platform ANSYS-CFX using the finite volume method to discretize the domain and solving the Navier–Stokes equations for both air and water in a Eulerian framework. Second-order space discretization scheme and second-order Euler Backward time discretization were used in the numerical treatment of the equations.

The numerical model depicted free surface waves as promoters <b>of</b> <b>air</b> entrainment that ultimately may explain the significant amount <b>of</b> <b>air</b> content in the chamber observed in preliminary tests after the filling process is completed. Results demonstrated that for the present design, against the intuition, the chamber must be filled with liquid at a modest flow rate to minimize free surface waviness during the flooding stage of the chamber...|$|R
40|$|Humidification {{dehumidification}} (HDH) is {{a promising}} technology for small scale seawater desalination and has received widespread attention in recent years. The biggest roadblock to commercialization {{of this technology}} is its relatively high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose thermodynamic balancing of the humidifier or the dehumidifier through mass extraction and injection as a potential means of reducing the energy consumption of these systems. Balancing minimizes the entropy generation caused by imbalance in driving temperature and concentration differences. We outline a procedure to model the system, using on-design component variables, such that continuous or discrete <b>extraction</b> and/or injection <b>of</b> <b>air</b> from the humidifier to the dehumidifier or vice versa can be analyzed. We present an extraction profile (mass flow rate ratio versus non-dimensional position) in the dehumidifier and the humidifier for attaining close to complete thermodynamic reversibility in an HDH system with a 100 % effective humidifier and dehumidifier. Further, we have examined in detail the effect of having finite-sized systems, of balancing the humidifier versus the dehumidifier, {{and that of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>extractions.</b> Center for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT and KFUPM (Project R 4 -CW- 08) United States.

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with air extraction behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>air</b> to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> inlet, the LPC with various air extractions to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when air extraction is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> to the third contour, and parameters <b>of</b> extracted <b>air</b> (depending on the point and amount <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>extraction,</b> and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} measure stable carbon isotope ratios (13 C/ 12 C) of light volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as isoprene, methacrolein (MACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) using gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GCC-IRMS). An automated sampling and cryofocussing system allowed for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> VOCs from <b>air</b> samples <b>of</b> up to 140 L <b>of</b> <b>air</b> collected over 3 h, and the subsequent 13 C/ 12 C analysis of the VOCs by GCC-IRMS. Chromatography using selective transfer between two columns was used to improve the separation for selected compounds, increasing peak resolution and attaining less noisy baselines. Still, some target compounds could not be completely separated from co-eluting peaks. To reduce the bias of isotope ratio determinations, which can result from incomplete peak resolution, a peak-fitting procedure has been developed. In cases of overlapping peaks or substantial baseline drift, this peak fitting allows more accurate determination of isotope ratios than conventional integration schemes. Comparisons between off-line IRMS measurements and a peak-evaluation procedure using a prepared VOC gas-phase standard show that isotope ratios derived from large (> 1 ng of carbon per peak) and well-resolved peaks have a reproducibility of ± 0. 3 ‰. With smaller masses {{in the range of}} 0. 1 – 1 ng of carbon, reproducibility decreased to ±(0. 5 – 0. 8) ‰. For a 140 L sample <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> such small masses of carbon correspond to mixing ratios in the low pptV range. The developed measurement {{technique was}} applied to a small set <b>of</b> ambient <b>air</b> samples taken during hot, sunny periods from late May to early August, 2005, at Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany, a semi-rural area. The range of δ 13 C values determined for isoprene, benzene, and toluene are consistent with those reported in the literature. GCC-IRMS results of δ 13 C for ambient samples of isoprene, MACR, and MVK, measured at mixing ratios of 15 – 280 pptV, are presented and discussed...|$|R
