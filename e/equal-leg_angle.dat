40|$|A variational {{model that}} {{describes}} the interactive buckling of a thin-walled <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> strut under pure axial compression is presented. A formulation combining the Rayleigh-Ritz method and continuous displacement functions is used to derive a system of differential and integral equilibrium equations for the structural component. Solving the equations using numerical continuation reveals progressive cellular buckling (or snaking) arising from the nonlinear interaction between the weak-axis flexural buckling mode and the strong-axis flexural-torsional buckling mode {{for the first time}} - the resulting behaviour being highly unstable. Physical experiments conducted on 10 cold-formed steel specimens are presented and the results show good agreement with the variational model...|$|E
40|$|When a sway force acts on a {{cross-bracing}} system, {{one of the}} braces {{goes into}} a tension state while the other goes into a compression state. The tension brace helps to stiffen the compression brace through a bolted intersecting point. This paper presents an energy method for determining the improved buckling capacity of such a compression brace. The braces considered consist of <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> members that intersect orthogonally. The present problem {{is more difficult to}} solve when compared to earlier studies made on rods and tubular brace members, because angle members may buckle in a complicated flexural torsional mode rather than in a simple flexural mode...|$|E
40|$|AbstractColumn is an {{important}} structural element in a building, because it carries some loads from the beams and the floors connecting to the column. Sometimes it needs to strengthen the existing column for some reasons. For example the load capacity of the column must be increased due to the compressive strength of the concrete column does not comply with the specified requirement. Investigation of the reinforced concrete column with angle steel shapes embedded {{at the corner of}} the column is limited. Therefore, it needs to investigate before developing the analysis for practical purpose design. This research conducts the experimental program of the reinforced concrete column with <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> steel shapes embedded at corner of the column. Eight specimens were tested in this experimental program. Four columns were subjected to the concentrically load and the others were subjected to eccentrically load. The specimens which embedded with angle steel shapes have various stiffeners spacing of 50 mm; 100 mm, and 150 mm. The column has length of 750 mm with sectional dimension of (75 mm x 75 mm). The column has four longitudinal reinforcements of 8 mm and stirrup of 5 mm. The <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> steel shape has size of (22. 1 mm x 22. 1 mm x 2 mm). The results of the experimental program show that compare to the reference specimen, the increment load of concentrically loaded column embedded with angle steel shape with stiffener spacing 50 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm were 210. 4447 %, 235. 5426 %, and 185. 6640 %, respectively. While the increment load of eccentrically loaded column embedded with angle steel shape with stiffener spacing 50 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm were 85. 5607 %, 34. 6697 %, and 42. 9479 %, respectivel...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the elastic limit state flexural-torsional postbuckling {{analysis}} of simply supported bars with open thin-walled asymmetric cross-sections under axial thrust. As {{it is well known}} stocky bars with the above type of cross-sections always fail by flexural-torsional buckling in the case of asymmetric cross-sections (whose centroid does not coincide with the shear centre), while in the case of monosymmetric cross-sections the failure may occur either through flexural (Euler) buckling or flexural-torsional buckling depending on the geometric characteristics of the bars. In all the above three cases the critical state is associated with postbuckling strength. In this paper attention focuses on the first yielding occurring at the initial part of the post-critical path of flexural-torsional buckling. This is, in case of bars made from ideal elastic-ideal plastic material, associated with the maximum combined normal stress, due to axial compression, bending and warping, which, along with the nonlinear equilibrium equation, yield the maximum (ultimate) elastic load-carrying capacity. The elastic limit state postbuckling analysis given here is demonstrated with the aid of <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angles</b> commonly used in trusses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Stainless steel has {{garnered}} {{attention as}} an alternative structural material to conventional carbon steel due to its corrosion resistance properties and aesthetic appearance. Of interest are single angles, which are frequently used in trusses, transmission towers, and as bracing diaphragms. When subjected to compression, knowledge concerning the behavior, analysis, and design of stainless steel single angles is very limited. This thesis addresses the behavior of duplex stainless steel single equal-leg angles subject to concentric compressive loading. Two complementary approaches are used in this study, {{the first of which}} was experimental and consisted of conducting 33 full-scale buckling tests on S 32003 duplex stainless steel single <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> components. Angles specimens had slenderness ratios ranging from 35 to 350 and leg width-to-thickness ratios of 7. 5 to 12. 3. In the second approach, computational models that accounted for material nonlinearity, material anisotropy, and geometric out-of-straightness were developed and validated using the experimentally obtained test results. These models were subsequently used to perform numerical buckling experiments to shed light on the behavior of axially loaded compression duplex stainless steel single angles {{for a wide range of}} practical leg width-to-thickness ratios. Results from the full-scale tests and from the numerical models are shown to correlate well with the classical mechanics-based formulae, which considers nonlinear stress-strain relationships, for predicting flexural and flexural-torsional buckling strengths of singly symmetric stainless steel members. Finally, design criteria in the form of load and resistance factor design (LRFD) with a reliability index of 3 for buckling limit states are proposed for possible adoption in future US national standards.

40|$|Envolto ao já conhecido comportamento de cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, questões aparentemente contraditórias tem sido reportadas em estudos experimentais de diversos autores, entre elas a ocorrência de modos de instabilidade em desacordo com aqueles obtidos via análise de estabilidade elástica, e forças axiais resistentes muito diferentes dos resultados teóricos (em geral, conservadoramente). Nestas condições, este trabalho procura analisar a fundo o comportamento das cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, de modo a contribuir com o entendimento dos fenômenos que dificultam a interpretação dos resultados experimentais, dentre os quais, o afastamento {{longitudinal}} entre a rótula e a extremidade das barras (no caso de barras com extremidades rotuladas), e o sentido da imperfeição global de flexão em torno do eixo de menor inércia, o qual mostrou-se um fator chave na determinação do comportamento das cantoneiras, especialmente para comprimentos próximos da transição entre os dois modos globais de instabilidade elástica. Para esta faixa de comprimentos, diferentes níveis de interação entre os dois modos globais podem ser obtidos. Ademais, estudos experimentais realizados por diversos autores, aqui complementados por uma série de ensaios realizados em cantoneiras com extremidades engastadas, formam um vasto banco de resultados, que é utilizado para (além de comparações nos estudos teóricos) avaliar diversos procedimentos de previsão teórica sugeridos por diferentes autores, ou advindos de interpretações a partir do procedimento normativo, à luz do comportamento teórico estudado na primeira etapa do trabalho. Assim, destes procedimentos, apenas um baseado no Método da Resistência Direta, e dois baseados no Método das Larguras Efetivas demonstraram bons resultados, sendo que todos eles, desconsiderando o modo de flexo-torção como um modo global de instabilidade. Ao fim, comenta-se da necessidade de se expandir alguns estudos específicos, pois ao adotar-se um procedimento baseado somente no modo global de flexão, apesar de se mostrar estatisticamente mais eficiente, verifica-se a possível ocorrência de resultados demasiadamente contra a segurança. On {{the well}} known behavior of <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> columns, some questions apparently paradoxical {{have been reported}} in experimental results from several authors, including the occurrence of different instability modes from the expected by the elastic stability analysis, and maximum axial compressive load expressly different (generally conservative) from theoretical previsions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the knowledge about the <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angle</b> columns behavior, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} features that complicate the interpretation of experimental results, among which, the longitudinal distance between the end sections and the center of hinges (pin-ended columns), and also the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection, which proved to play a key role in the post-critical column behavior, specially for column lengths near of the transition between global buckling modes (major-axis flexural-torsional and minor-axis flexural modes). On this range of lengths, different modal interaction amplitudes can be obtained, only with the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection (i. e., the amplitude of this imperfection plays a negligible influence on the column behavior). Furthermore, putting together a fairly large column ultimate strength data bank comprising experimental test results performed by several authors, collected from the available literature, and new experimental results on fixed-ended angle columns performed in this work, important comparisons with theoretical studies can be showed as well as evaluation of several ultimate strength theoretical prevision procedures, either those suggested by another authors as those arising from interpretations of normative procedures in the light of theoretical behavior verified in the first stage of labor. In conclusion, only one procedure based on Direct Strength Method and two procedures based on Effective Width Method exhibited accurate results, all of which neglecting the flexural-torsional mode as a global mode. Thus, it is important to mention that some additional studies are needed, because if adopted a procedure based only in the minor-axis flexural mode, despite being statistically advantageous, it is verified the possibility to occurs quite unconservative results...|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{very few}} {{research}} papers concerning built-up members made of Pultruded FRP (PFRP) material {{are available and}} no technical standard reports recommendations and design rules specifically suited for these members. Dicuonzo et al. (4 th Int. Conf. on FRP Comp. in Civil Eng., CICE 2008) presented a temporary, modular all-GFRP structure designed for an expo fair stand. In this structure, the 3 m-high columns are comprised of two standard PFRP C-shaped profiles with dimensions 203 x 56 x 9. 5 mm, connected with one another through 500 mm-spaced bonded battens. The modular, 6 m-span roof girders allow for covering 12 m-span lengths without requiring intermediate columns. Top and bottom chords of the roof girders are comprised of two standard PFRP <b>equal-leg</b> <b>angles</b> with dimensions 102 x 102 x 9. 5 mm, once again connected with one another using bonded battens. Bai et al. (Mater Struct 2013; 46 : 1143 - 54) performed four-point bending tests on built-up members used in the five-storey GFRP Eyecatcher building in Basel, Switzerland. That structure, built in 1999, still remains the tallest FRP building in the world. Its structural skeleton is comprised of three parallel trapezoidal GFRP frames connected by wooden decks. The {{various members of the}} frames were designed by assembling individual standard PFRP shapes by continuous bonding. Boscato et al. (Compos Struct 2015; 121 : 46 - 63) presented experimental results on PFRP built-up columns comprised of four standard C-shaped profiles mutually connected at discrete points either by bolting or by bonding. In a first attempt to interpret the experimental results with simple closed-form equations, the authors compared the experimentally evaluated buckling loads with those estimated using (1) Euler's and (2) Engesser's equations (applied to the built-up columns considered as members with uniform cross-section) and (3) an expression typically adopted for steel built-up members. Unfortunately, none of these expressions was capable to predict the experimental buckling loads and the authors concluded that geometrically nonlinear FE analyses are necessarily to be performed to capture the actual column behavior. The previously quoted papers do not raise the issue of a systematic approach to the design of PFRP built-up members, which should consider: various basic profiles (C- and L-shaped, etcetera); different types of connection between basic profiles (battens and or lacings, connected by bolting and/or bonding, etcetera); changes in geometric characteristics (member total length, spacing of the battens, etcetera); and various types of loading. In this context, the present paper deals with a series of parametric analyses of PFRP built-up columns comprised of two closely spaced C-shaped profiles. Numerical models of the columns are developed using bidimensional orthotropic finite elements. In order to define the maximum distance between the battens that ensures an overall buckling behavior, linear buckling analyses are carried out for different spacings of the battens. Moreover, to investigate the influence of the batten stiffness, both rigid and deformable battens are used in the models. Finally, geometrically nonlinear analyses of the coumns with initial imperfection are carried out to capture the ultimate resistance. In these analyses, the ultimate conditions are located either by a peak in the load-lateral deflection column response or by the attainment of the limiting material strenght at some point of the column. Since several battens spacings are considered, the numerical results obtained could be used, in analogy to the case of PFRP I-section columns (see National Research Council of Italy, CNR-DT 205 / 2007), to define a buckling design curve for built-up columns...|$|R

Since these triangular-base towers are economical, they are also being increasingly used as electrical transmission line towers. The legs of these towers generally consist of 60 ∘ equal leg angles (either 90 ∘ rolled angles bent to 60 ∘ or rolled 60 ∘ angles) which are primarily compression members. Results of experimental investigation on eighteen <b>equal-leg</b> schifflerized <b>angles</b> (90 ∘ angles bent to 60 ∘) under concentric axial compressive loading with hinge-hinge end conditions are presented. Five sizes of angles viz. 5 x 5 x 5 / 16, 4 x 4 x 1 / 4, 312 x 312 x 4 / 16, 3 x 3 x 3 / 8, 3 x 3 x 1 / 4 in., of 300 and 400 MPa nominal yield strength with slenderness ratios varying between 50 and 95 are included in the investigation. The nominal width-thickness ratios of legs ranged between 8 and 16. The experimental failure loads are compared with loads obtained from a finite element model. The analytical problem has been solved for failure loads under geometric and material nonlinearity. A Newtonian approach with eight-node shell elements has been employed for the nonlinear solution using commercially available software 2 ̆ 2 ABAQUS 2 ̆ 2. Residual stress variations along the cross-section and through-the-thickness are included. All results are compared with those obtained from CAN/CSA-S 37 -M 86, ASCE Manual No. 52 and other specifications.
