2500|$|In {{southern}} England, {{where the}} climate is mild and the hills low, transhumance historically took the opposite form to more mountainous areas. Cattle were grazed on <b>dry,</b> <b>sandy</b> <b>heath</b> on the hills in winter and in the rich, low-lying flood-meadows (also called water meadows) in summer, once flood-water receded[...] The Weald, as another example, was used [...] for the grazing of pigs; a use known as pannage. While transhumance is little practised today, it has left its mark on English toponymy. Paired place names such as Winterfold Heath and Somersbury Wood attest to the history.|$|E

50|$|Boletus pinetorum is an edible bolete fungus {{found in}} Fennoscandia. It was {{described}} as a new species in 2009 from a collection made in Finland. It resembles the popular Boletus edulis but is distinct from that species genetically. Fruitbodies of B. pinetorum have greyish brown caps with wrinkled margins. The bolete is mycorrhizal with pines, and grows in <b>dry</b> <b>sandy</b> pine <b>heaths</b> and <b>dry</b> coniferous forests.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} {{comprises}} 60% woods, 26% heath, 8,5% cultivated land, 3% pasture, 2% marsh and 1,5% settlements, lakes, etc. There are about 5,100 hectares of <b>dry</b> <b>sandy</b> <b>heath,</b> the largest remaining, contiguous, inland heath of its type (a Zwergstrauchheide) in central Europe. The reserve also has extensive coniferous forests, predominantly of pine trees. These {{go back to}} the reforestation of the heathland in the 19th century. There are also small stands of older deciduous trees: oaks and beech. The high proportion of woods makes the LÃ¼neburg Heath Nature Reserve one of the largest areas of protected woodland in Germany. In addition there are streams and small valleys, marshes, meadows, pastures, fields and open sands.|$|E

50|$|Further {{complication}} {{arises when}} adjacent transmitters have to transmit {{on the same}} frequency and under these circumstances the broadcast radiation patterns are attenuated in the relevant direction(s). A {{good example of this}} is in the United Kingdom, where the Waltham transmitting station broadcasts at high power on the same frequencies as the <b>Sandy</b> <b>Heath</b> transmitting station's high power transmissions, with the two being only 50 miles apart. Thus Waltham's antenna array http://www.aerialsandtv.com/walthamtx.html#WalthamsTransmittingArray does not broadcast these two channels in the direction of <b>Sandy</b> <b>Heath</b> and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|Trees and grasses are not {{the only}} {{vegetation}} in the dunes though. The <b>sandy</b> dune <b>heaths</b> in Thy National Park are a rare habitat in a European context, and they are to be protected by law, so they have been a major contributory factor in establishing the national park. It is a continuous job trying to preserve them from invading flora. The larger animals are grazing excess vegetation, trees are sometimes uprooted and controlled burning is carried out occasionally, to give the <b>sandy</b> <b>heath</b> a chance. The heath vegetation might look simple to the untrained eye, but is in fact very varied, dominated by common heather, sand sedge, marram grass, the edible black crowberry, bell heather and various lichens. The <b>sandy</b> <b>heaths</b> of Thy attract many birds with some very rare breeders (in Denmark), such as crane and wood sandpiper and they form a habitat for a variety of smaller animals like the natterjack toad and many insects. The wet hollows in between support quite different plants such as bog bilberry, bayberry, marsh gentian, cranberry and a variety of sundew.|$|R

Crepuscular insects, such as moths, are its food.|$|R
