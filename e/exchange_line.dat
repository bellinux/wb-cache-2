5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct <b>Exchange</b> <b>Line</b> (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E

50|$|Remote call {{forwarding}} {{is also a}} means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>line,</b> this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local calls are flat-rated but trunk calls are expensive.|$|E
5000|$|Businesses - A company {{located in}} China {{can have a}} phone number in Los Angeles or London without paying for a fixed foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>line.</b> Virtual numbers are very popular among call centers which appear to be located in one country, {{when they are in}} one or more {{countries}} in different time zone, delivering efficient 24/7 cover.|$|E
50|$|The primary form of {{telecommunications}} in the 1980s was local and long-distance telephone service administered by six regional bureaus: Beijing (north region), Shanghai (east region), Xi'an (northwest region), Chengdu (southwest region), Wuhan (centralsouth region), and Shenyang (northeast region). These regional headquarters served as switching centers for provincial-level subsystems. By 1986 China had nearly 3 million telephone <b>exchange</b> <b>lines,</b> including 34,000 long-distance <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> with direct, automatic service to 24 cities. By late 1986 fiber optic communications technology was being employed {{to relieve the}} strain on existing telephone circuits. International service was routed through overseas exchanges located in Beijing and Shanghai. Guangdong Province had coaxial cable and microwave lines linking it to Hong Kong and Macau.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "SIM box" [...] is an {{unofficial}} voice over IP gateway which uses multiple mobile telephones and SIM cards for PSTN connectivity, while connecting to the Internet by conventional means. These are normally operated clandestinely in third-world calling destinations as the [...] "black" [...] {{end of a}} [...] "grey route" [...] where conventional private branch <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> (such as T-carrier primary rate interface) are not available to VoIP operators due to a hostile local regulatory environment.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{services}} offer {{international call}} forwarding by allocating {{for the customer}} a local virtual phone number which is forwarded to any other international destination. The number was permanently forwarded and had no associated telephone line. As a means to obtain an inbound number from another town or region for business use, [...] "remote call forwarding" [...] schemes tend to be far less expensive than foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> but more costly than using voice over IP to obtain a local number in the chosen city.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{technical}} limitations; voice over IP users {{in particular are}} difficult to geolocate as their calls may be gated to the {{public switched telephone network}} at a point hundreds or thousands of miles away from their actual location. A roaming mobile or Internet telephone user is effectively (like the user of a foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>line)</b> attached to a distant rate centre far from their physical address.|$|E

It was the closest of Wath-upon-Dearne's three railway {{stations}} to the town centre, lying immediately to its north-east, over the Dearne and Dove Canal bridge. The station was closed when local passenger services on the line ended on 29 June 1959. (The line continued {{to be used for}} freight traffic until 1988).|$|E
50|$|The line {{branched}} off the Leeds-Bradford <b>Exchange</b> <b>line</b> west of Bramley. Shortly after, a track from Stanningley {{joined the}} line in a trailing junction, effectively forming a triangular junction. Just after passing under Lowtown street, the first intermediate station in Pudsey Lowtown was reached. Crossing under Robin Lane, Radcliffe Lane, South Parade, and New Street, the line reached second intermediate station and former terminus Pudsey Greenside. The two stations were located {{at either end of}} Pudsey town.|$|E

Rich in metaphor, they are known and recited by ordinary people in modern language. Like Tsangmo, Lozey may be sung in a call-and-reply fashion, and may be a means of competition. Certain Lozey are sung in vernacular language.|$|R

Walker states that he had failed marriages and advises her not to rush into nuptials. A gentle flirtation takes place and she kisses Walker three times, becoming somewhat infatuated with the dashing pilot, unlike anyone she has ever met. He stops the seduction before it goes any further, directing her to tune the radio to KBEX, which is playing Glenn Miller's [...] "Moonlight Serenade".|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} that longish edifice {{the street}} flows into a square {{completely}} surrounded by places of learning: the main building of the University with its Head Office and Biology and Soil School, another building with its History and Philosophy Schools, yet another one with the celebrated Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the State Optics Institute. These form what is now known as Andrei Sakharov Square, from which the passage along to the opposite embankment continues a little to the left and is known as Birzhevaya liniya (Биржевая линия, Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>Line)</b> after the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange, whose historic building (recently vacated by the Russian Central Naval Museum) is located just a little to the east.|$|E
50|$|West of Pudsey Greenside station {{the line}} passed under Carlisle Road and through Greenside Tunnel, {{continued}} through a short cutting, passed under Smalewell Quarry track, then over Tyersal Beck on an almost straight embankment which {{was reported to}} be the largest of its kind in Europe, over Tyersal Lane, and under a farm track near Tyersal House. It joined the line from Ardswell and Gildersome to Laisterdyke at Cutlers Junction under the bridge of Arkwright Street, from where the tracks continued west to Laisterdyke on the Leeds-Bradford <b>Exchange</b> <b>line</b> and east to Shipley and Windhill on the Shipley and Windhill Line. Furthermore, a track connection existed south of Cutlers Junction between Tyersal Junction and Broad Lane Junction, forming another triangular junction.|$|E
5000|$|Feature Group A: The {{original}} implementation, {{in which}} a user has to dial the local telephone number of a provider's gateway, followed by (usually) a password, then the desired long-distance number. There is a different local access number in each local calling area. This requires no special capability at the local telephone company office as competing long distance providers connected using standard local lines, {{which may or may}} not support caller ID. If a carrier has no local presence, a foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>line</b> is used to reach its nearest point of presence. Once the standard means of accessing alternate long-distance carriers, local access numbers are now used primarily for low-cost prepaid calling cards as the calls may be made from any phone, at flat or local rates.|$|E

40|$|Charge {{exchange}} emission {{is known}} to provide a key diagnostic to the interface between hot and cold matter in many astrophysical environments. Most of the recent charge exchange studies focus on its emission in the X-ray band, but few on the UV part, although the latter can also provide a powerful probe of the charge exchange process. An atomic calculation, {{as well as an}} application to observed data, are presented to explore and describe the potential use of the UV data for the study of cosmic charge exchange. Using the newest charge exchange model in the SPEX code v 3. 03, we re-analyze an archival Hubble STIS data of the central region of NGC 1275. The NGC 1275 spectrum shows hints for three possible weak lines at about 1223. 6 Å, 1242. 4 Å, and 1244. 0 Å, each with a significance of about 2 - 3 σ. The putative features are best explained by charge exchange between highly ionized hydrogen, neon, and sulfur with neutral matter. The wavelengths of the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> are found robustly with uncertainties ≤ 0. 3 Å. The possible charge exchange emission shows a line-of-sight velocity offset of about - 3400 km s^- 1 with respect to the NGC 1275 nucleus, which resembles one of the Lyα absorbers reported in Baum et al. (2005). This indicates that the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> might be emitted as the same position of the absorber, which could be ascribed to outflowing gas from the nucleus.

50|$|The main {{operator}} control units, of these plans, appeared {{similar to a}} 232 plus Bellset 26 combo but was now a Tele 248 plus Bellset 39a (early versions) or 44 (later). These bellsets had a recess, in the front, dominated by a horizontal, quadrant mounted, 4 position slider, flanked by either 1 or 2 press buttons, for buzzing the extension(s). These Bellsets 39a and 44 were bellsets in name only, as they contained no bell. What they did contain was a maze of spring contact sets, mainly activated by a cam at the pivot of the slide switch. The system required a separate, remote mounted bellset, for incoming signalling. The main unit could make and answer exchange calls, talk to and transfer calls to the extension(s). The extensions could call and {{talk to each other}} and the main unit, but could only make external calls if a request to the operator, for the <b>exchange</b> <b>line,</b> was honoured.When this system was eventually revisited and brought up to date, with the 700 series Plans 105 and 107, the equivalent control unit was dubbed 'The Planset'.|$|E
