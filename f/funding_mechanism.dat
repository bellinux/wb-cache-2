2500|$|The Reconstruction period brought many {{challenges}} for Dallas and some {{benefits for the}} state. On 19 June 1865 (Juneteenth), Texan slaves were emancipated, as announcement {{of the end of}} the war was delayed. Many African Americans migrated to Dallas after the war for work, because the city was thriving compared to other Southern cities. They also wanted to leave rural areas to escape the supervision of whites and establish their own communities. Freedmen's towns were scattered throughout Dallas. In attempts to maintain white supremacy, white insurgent veterans established a Ku Klux Klan chapter in 1868. [...] By 1871, Dallas legally became a city. In 1869 the Reconstruction legislature established a <b>funding</b> <b>mechanism</b> to support public education for the first time, and authorized school districts to be set up across the state.|$|E

This paper offers a taxonomy of various unconventional <b>funding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (i. e. outside the domain of charges for transit passengers or general taxation schemes), based on a review of financial arrangements for public transport. The paper identifies which classes of funding are particularly successful for the financing of transit systems. This cross-sectional analysis uses a type of artificial intelligence method, viz. rough set analysis. It appears {{that the nature of}} the funding scheme and the degree of public acceptability are mainly responsible for the success of unconventional <b>funding</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
