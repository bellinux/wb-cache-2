5000|$|On a {{vertical}} band <b>knife</b> <b>machine</b> usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, {{the most common}} width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band <b>knife</b> <b>machine.</b> The dimensions are indicated on a small metal tag pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical <b>machine</b> band <b>knife</b> blade is most commonly a [...] "double bevel, double edge DBDE" [...] execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the [...] "double bevel, single edge DBSE" [...] execution cuts only in one direction. Productivity is enhanced when the operator cuts both while advancing and also while retracting the work table after adjusting the foam block after each pass for cutting. The DBDE execution blade can have a parallel or twisted 180 degrees welding. The twisted welding execution saves a grinding unit, as both edges pass the same grinding unit after two turns. It has been observed that a narrow width on {{a vertical}} band <b>knife</b> <b>machine</b> gives better dimensional accuracies on the foam block. The wider the vertical <b>machine</b> band <b>knife</b> - more the deflection and size variation {{from one end to}} the other extreme end.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of optimization frameworks for radiation treatment plan-ning problems in this thesis. Firstly, an automated treatment planning framework is developed for the Gamma <b>Knife</b> <b>machine,</b> a specialized unit for the radiation treatment of brain tumors. Nonlinear programs and a mixed integer program are presented to obtain treatment plans. Since nonconvex nonlinear programs do not guarantee global optimality, two techniques are developed to enhance the perfor-mance of the optimization models by generating initial starting points. The first technique is a heuristic-based approach to find an initial {{starting point for the}} discrete variables of the nonlinear program (the isocenters of radiation doses and the collimator sizes.) This technique uses a variant of a sphere packing approach combined with a Medial Axis Transformation, often used in computer graphics. A linear program is then solved to find the initial radiation exposure time by fixing the values of the discrete variables generated by the above heuristic. Since the amount of data used in the optimization is very large, an iterativ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a real-life 1. 5 D cutting stock problem, which arises in a make-to-order plastic company.

The total production cost includes not only material wastage, as in traditional cutting stock problems, but also production time. A variety of factors are taken into account, like cutter <b>knife</b> changes, <b>machine</b> restrictions, due dates and other work in progress limitations. These restrictions make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex. As a result, existing algorithms and mathematical models are no longer appropriate. Thus we developed a new 1. 5 D cutting stock model with multiple objectives and multi-constraints and solve this problem in an incomplete enumerative way. The computational results show that the solution procedure is easy to implement and works very well...|$|R

40|$|Generative {{models can}} be seen as the swiss army <b>knives</b> of <b>machine</b> learning, as many {{problems}} can be written probabilistically in terms of the distribution of the data, including prediction, reconstruction, imputation and simulation. One of the most promising directions for unsupervised learning may lie in Deep Learning methods, given their success in supervised learning. However, one of the cur- rent problems with deep unsupervised learning methods, is that they often are harder to scale. As a result there are some easier, more scalable shallow meth- ods, such as the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Student-t Mixture Model, that remain surprisingly competitive. In this paper we propose a new scalable deep generative model for images, called the Deep Gaussian Mixture Model, that is a straightforward but powerful generalization of GMMs to multiple layers. The parametrization of a Deep GMM allows it to efficiently capture products of vari- ations in natural images. We propose a new EM-based algorithm that scales well to large datasets, and we show that both the Expectation and the Maximization steps can easily be distributed over multiple machines. In our density estimation experiments we show that deeper GMM architectures generalize better than more shallow ones, with results in the same ballpark as the state of the art...|$|R
