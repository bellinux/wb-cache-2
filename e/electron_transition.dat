5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic {{it turns out to}} be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the <b>electron</b> <b>transition</b> between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the <b>electron</b> <b>transition</b> between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

50|$|For {{a neutral}} {{hydrogen}} atom, spectral lines are formed when an <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> between energy levels. The Lyman series of spectral lines {{are produced by}} <b>electrons</b> <b>transitioning</b> between the ground state and higher energy levels (excited states). The Lyman-alpha transition corresponds to an <b>electron</b> <b>transitioning</b> between the ground state (n=1) and the first excited state (n=2).

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> {{can happen}} at low {{energy of the}} exciting radiation (∼ 0.4 eV) which correspond to wavelength of ∼ 3.1 μ m. Yet, the photo-emf signal is observed at the radiation wavelengths up to 5 μ m in our measurements. The presence of the photo-emf response in this range can only be explained if the QD layer is considered as a single ensemble of mutually interacting centers. An effective positive charge in the QD layer forms a potential well for electrons in the conduction band. This leads to reduction of energy needed for <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> from the QD ensemble states to the conduction band. Partial emptying of the states makes <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> possible and, at the same time, {{does not lead to}} significant change in the potential wells depth. As a result, <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> can happen at the exciting radiation energies as low as 0.25 eV. Hole transitions also can happen at these energies via a large number of excited states in the QD ensemble.|$|R
500|$|The {{potential}} energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when {{the distance from}} the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an <b>electron</b> <b>transition</b> to a higher level results in an excited state. The electron's energy raises when n increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [...] is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.|$|E

30|$|It may be {{concluded}} that {{the likelihood of the}} <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> decreases faster than that of the hole transitions as the exciting radiation energy decreases in the considered wavelength range. However, first it is necessary to empty the levels by the <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> to make possible hole transitions. This could be achieved by using an additional radiation of the spectral domain where the probability of the <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> is high. So, bias lighting stimulates the hole <b>transitions</b> by exciting <b>electrons</b> that leads to emptying the levels. In this case the electron concentration is not modulated as distinct from the hole concentration which is modulated at the chopper frequency. This explains the observed low magnitude of the photo-emf in the wavelength range > 2.6 μ m and its increase under bias lighting.|$|R

Strong anisotropic {{characteristics of the}} dynamic polarizabilities were found for all the nanotubes. The transitional intensity along the tubular axis is much larger than that perpendicular to the axis for all the nanotubes. The optical gaps of sp 3 -hybridized infinitely-long pentagonal SWSiNTs are near 3. 0 eV and 4. 7 eV owing to σ-σ* transitions along {{the direction of the}} tubular axis. The optical gaps of sp 2 -hybridized infinitely-long armchair SWSiNTs along the tube axis direction are about 0. 7 eV and 2. 4 eV for Si(3, 3) SWSiNTs and 0. 7 eV and 2. 7 eV for Si(4, 4) SWSiNTs. The former peak at 0. 7 eV originated from π-π* <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> and the latter peak at 2. 4 eV or 2. 7 eV originated from σ-σ* <b>electron</b> <b>transitions.</b> Meanwhile, the intensities of π-π* <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> are stronger than those of σ-σ* <b>electron</b> <b>transitions</b> in SWSiNTs.

5000|$|A {{non-bonding}} orbital, {{also known}} as non-bonding molecular orbital (NBMO), is a molecular orbital whose occupation by electrons neither increases nor decreases the bond order between the involved atoms.

Non-bonding orbitals are the equivalent in molecular orbital theory of the lone pairs in Lewis structures. The energy level of a non-bonding orbital is typically in between the lower energy of a valence shell bonding orbital and the higher energy of a corresponding antibonding orbital.
