With a value of $24million, Fitzgeralds financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history. In addition to the crew, [...] of taconite sank along with the vessel. Two widows of crewmen filed a $1.5million lawsuit against Fitzgeralds owners, Northwestern Mutual, and its operators, Oglebay Norton Corporation, one week after she sank. An additional $2.1million lawsuit was later filed. Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to [...] "limit their liability to $817,920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members." [...] The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements. Robert Hemming, a reporter and newspaper editor, reasoned in his book about Fitzgerald that the USCG's conclusions [...] "were benign in placing blame on either the company or the captain... saved the Oglebay Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1979 a {{group of}} Cali, Colombia {{marijuana}} traffickers headed by Jaime deJesus Cordoba-Vargas and Jaime deJesus Marin-Jaramillo organized a venture to smuggle marijuana into the U.S. aboard the 168 ft motor vessel Samarkanda, a surplus U.S. Navy net tender converted to a tugboat and once called Alexandra. The standard procedure for the group was to load contraband on [...] "mother ships" [...] in South America, sail north, then rendezvous with smaller [...] "contact" [...] vessels off the U.S. coast. They operated under the theory that if the ship picked up contraband {{on the high seas}} and delivered it on the high seas they would not violate any national laws except perhaps that of its <b>flag</b> <b>country,</b> Colombia. To a certain extent, the smugglers were correct.|$|E

50|$|The ‘textile market’ {{comprises}} {{many different}} applications and requirements. The intended {{use of the}} fabric {{is the most important}} starting point to identify exactly what’s needed to produce a specific end-product. A ‘textile’ product may vary from natural yarns for garments, through to synthetic fibres for flags and banners. A ‘textile product’ can be a wall mounted banner, a stand-alone pop-up banner, a beach <b>flag,</b> <b>country</b> flag or company flag. It can be a carpet, back-lit frame, curtain, room divider, building wrap, bed cover, a garment and much more. The predominant textile media used in visual communication is a polyester based fabric. In the USA, nylon is often used for flags. In northern Europe, polyspun material has been the choice of fabric for traditional flag printing. In today’s market, a woven or knitted polyester is the de facto standard. This differs from the predominant coated vinyl or pvc media used in the sign and display industry.The production process needs to fit requirements for the type of ink: high energy sublimation (also known as disperse direct), low energy sublimation (dye-sub), acid, reactive and pigment. In turn, the type of ink chemistry needs to fit requirements for the media (such as polyester, nylon, cotton, silk). Based on the media and ink combination, the choice comes for infra-red fixation, heat-press sublimation or steaming. The structure of the fabric also needs attention, for example whether it is woven, non-woven or knitted.|$|E

In 1977 Japan and North-Korea had settled a 200 miles zone. however Japan kept the conventional fisheries agreements involving China and Korea with an advantage to the <b>flag</b> <b>country.</b> Since the late 1990 's Japan. Korea. and China had ratified the UNCLOS, and declared 200 miles EEZ respectively. After rounds of serious negotiation the three countries came to conclusive agreement concerning fisheries based on EEl institut. ion each other. As a result, North-East Asia has been covered with EEZ. Such new relationships concerning fisheries have been characterized as provisional and irregular {{as a result of}} the different parameters regarding sovereignty each country insists upon relating to land, resources, and interests involving fisheries. This paper analyzes the process of forming new fisheries relationships at the point of negotiation and these relationships' characteristics. Further, we propose some methods for more maintaining rational sustainable fisheries in these areas...|$|E
