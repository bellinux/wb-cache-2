25|$|During {{the early}} centuries of Islam, the sīra {{literature}} was taken less seriously {{compared to the}} hadiths. In Umayyad times, storytellers (qāṣṣ, pl. quṣṣāṣ) used to tell stories of Muhammad and earlier prophets in private gatherings and mosques, given they obtain permission from the authorities. Many of these storytellers are now unknown. After the Umayyad period, their reputation deteriorated because of their inclination to exaggerate and fantasize, and for relying on the Isra'iliyat. Thus they were banned from preaching at mosques. In later periods, however, works of sīra became more prominent. More recently, western <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> and debate concerning sīra have elicited a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote apologetic literature defending its content.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Berk Sirman: Developing Variations – An Analytical and Historical Perspective. Uppsala Universitet: Institutionen för musikvetenskap, uppsats för 60 p., 2006. Developing {{variations}} {{is a term}} by Arnold Schönberg that is coined {{to describe}} constant modification of motives and ideas in a theme, or possibly throughout the whole work. This {{is thought to be}} superior to exact repetitions. Developing variations was used by Schönberg to analyze the music of Brahms, whose compositions represented the most advanced form of developing variations. This paper investigates the analytical grounds of developing variations and <b>historical</b> <b>criticisms</b> against it, mainly on the charge of anachronism. <b>Historical</b> <b>criticisms</b> are valid, but developing variations is analytically sound nevertheless. Therefore it is not undermined by such criticisms...|$|R

25|$|This {{description}} is generally identified {{as part of}} the Priestly source ("P"), written in the sixth or fifth century BCE. However whilst the first Priestly source takes the form of instructions, the second is largely a repetition of the first in the past tense, i.e., it describes the execution of the instructions. Many scholars contend that it is of a far later date than the time of Moses, and that the description reflects the structure of Solomon's Temple, while some hold that the description derives from memories of a real pre-monarchic shrine, perhaps the sanctuary at Shiloh. Traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. According to <b>historical</b> <b>criticism,</b> an earlier, pre-exilic source, the Elohist ("E"), describes the Tabernacle as a simple tent-sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was strong.|$|E

The stirring incidents in the political emancipation of Portugal inspired his muse, and he describes the bitterness of exile, the adventurous expedition to Terceira, the heroic defence of Porto, and the final combats of liberty. In 1837 he founded the Panorama in imitation of the English Penny Magazine, and there and in Illustração he published the historical tales which were afterwards collected into Lendas e Narrativas; {{in the same year}} he became royal librarian at the Ajuda Palace, which enabled him to continue his studies of the past. The Panorama had a large circulation and influence, and Herculano's biographical sketches of great men and his articles of literary and <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> did much to educate the middle class by acquainting them with the story of their nation, and with the progress of knowledge and the state of letters in foreign countries.|$|E

25|$|Born in Breslau in the Prussian Silesia as the {{grandson}} of Daniel Schleiermacher, a pastor at one time associated with the Zionites, {{and the son of}} Gottlieb Schleiermacher, a Reformed Church chaplain in the Prussian army, Schleiermacher started his formal education in a Moravian school at Niesky in Upper Lusatia, and at Barby near Magdeburg. However, pietistic Moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts, and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the University of Halle, which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the rationalist spirit of Christian Wolff and Johann Salomo Semler. As a theology student Schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the Old Testament and of Oriental languages. However, he did attend the lectures of Semler, where he became acquainted with the techniques of <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> of the New Testament, and of Johann Augustus Eberhard, from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. At the same time he studied the writings of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, and began to apply ideas from the Greek philosophers to a reconstruction of Kant's system.|$|E

Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, though, I think, he is only about 28 years of age. I have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were not to be taken literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning that much in the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically." [...] Chamberlin believed that evolution explained not only the origin of organisms but of human theological beliefs as well.|$|E

At BYU he published several {{articles in the}} student newspaper {{on topics such as}} <b>historical</b> <b>criticism</b> of the Bible and the relationship of evolutionary theory with religious beliefs. [...] In 1925, he wrote a biography of his brother William H. Chamberlin, a philosopher and theologian who had died several years earlier. Utah philosopher Sterling McMurrin, stated the biography [...] "had a considerable impact" [...] on his own life, and noted [...] "the fact that the book adequately and persuasively presents W. H. Chamberlin's philosophic thought shows the philosophical competence of Ralph Chamberlin" [...] In 1932, Chamberlin wrote [...] "Life in Other Worlds: a Study in the History of Opinion", one of the earliest surveys from ancient to modern times of the concept of cosmic pluralism, the idea that the universe contains multiple inhabited worlds. After retiring in 1948, Chamberlin devoted significant attention to the history of the University of Utah. In 1949 he edited a biographical tribute to John R. Park, an influential Utah educator of the 19th century. Assembled from comments and reflections from Park's own students, Memories of John Rockey Park was praised by University of Utah English professor B. Roland Lewis, who claimed it [...] "warrants being read by every citizen of [...]" [...] Later in his career, Chamberlin produced an authoritative book, The University of Utah, a History of its First Hundred Years, which BYU historian Eugene E.

40|$|Benchmarking {{is a well}} {{established}} and respected mechanism that contributes to organisational improvement. Its epistemology demonstrates it to be theoretically underdetermined with literature focusing on pragmatism and praxis. Benchmarking's critics hold it to be a-theoretical; failing to provide its practitioners with a reliable basis for distinguishing between effective and ineffective efforts. The purpose of this thesis is to review Benchmarking's epistemology and identify the necessary or sufficient methodological elements contributing to its effectiveness and to establish them within an acceptable theoretical framework. A causal approach {{is applied to the}} objectives of organisational benchmarking's current definitions and implementation frameworks. The resulting theoretical framework is then validated against current exemplary benchmarking praxis to explain its effectiveness and satisfy <b>historical</b> <b>criticisms.</b> Central to the approach is the application of supervenience and entailment relationships between benchmarking parties within the umbrella of Peircean Causation to determine the feasibility of a benchmarking proposition. Benchmarking's a priori effectiveness (sufficiency) can be established from an organisational axiom and five logical conditions. This research establishes a new encompassing definition of benchmarking reduces its typology to a single consistent form and establishes an Effective Benchmarking Process that explains current practices and addresses <b>historical</b> <b>criticisms.</b> These logical conditions also explain the effectiveness of empirical frameworks such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and ISO 9000. A theoretical foundation for benchmarking provides a platform for extending the theory of organisational improvement. It also has significant potential to enhance organisational sustainability by reducing wasted effort. This research focuses on the causal linkages between benchmarking and organisational sustainability. The research establishes a new definition of benchmarking, specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for its application and frames practitioner efforts within an Effective Benchmarking Process (EBP) ...|$|R
