500|$|... "Return to Sender" [...] was {{generally}} praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It just keeps getting better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of [...] "Return to Sender" [...] by saying, [...] "Dexter did it again. Wowed me.

500|$|... "Smooth Criminal" [...] was {{the most}} highly praised number of the night. Both Slezak and Lynch gave it an [...] "A+": the former called it [...] "an instant Glee classic" [...] that [...] "had me on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> musical chair from start to finish", and Lynch wrote, [...] "Santana {{declared}} herself the winner, but the actual victors were 2Cellos, the real-life Croatian cellists whose manic intensity stole the scene." [...] Slezak was similarly impressed by 2Cellos—"this was really a duet between Santana and those amazing black cellos"—and Futterman called them [...] "furiously awesome" [...] and said of the song, [...] "It's the perfect soundtrack for the show's slickest villains: Santana wails, Sebastian channels his Chuck Bass and we are sold." [...] Bell described it as [...] "easily {{one of the best}} performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "Santana was flawless". Chaney dissented from the acclaim with a [...] "D" [...] grade.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat.

500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars.

[...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't sitting on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots".

500|$|Writing for Zap2it, Andrea Reiher {{stated that}} this episode {{was the best}} since the pilot, {{explaining}} that [...] "if {{they continue to be}} this good, this show should be in for a long run." [...] Reiher cited Goodwin's [...] "wonderful, captivating" [...] performance and the parallels between the Storybrooke and Enchanted Forest stories as particular highlights. In a review from TV Fanatic, writer Christine Orlando stated that the episode [...] "had me on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat and enjoying the ride," [...] giving particular praise to Snow and Charming's chemistry-filled early relationship. Orlando concluded, [...] "Snow White, the character I had the least interest in two weeks ago, held her own and then some. Heck, I was so enthralled by her story that, for the first time ever, I can't wait to learn more." [...] Sound on Sights Ricky D thought it wise that the episode focused on Snow and Charming, [...] "without feeling the need to include multiple stories."

500|$|According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's {{style was}} {{influenced}} by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working {{as a writer and}} storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine the series' subversive humor with [...] "beautiful" [...] moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are [...] "relaxing" [...] and feature [...] "conversational dialogue that feels natural [...] not over the top [...] cartoony and shrill". Ward described the show as a [...] "dark comedy"; he said [...] "dark comedies are my favorite, because I love that feeling – being happy and scared at the same time. It's my favorite way to feel – when I'm on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat but I'm happy, that sense of conflicting emotions. And there's a lot of that in the show, I think." [...] Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games. Ward intends the show's world to have a certain physical logic instead of [...] "cartoony slapstick"; even though magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world.|$|E
500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E
5000|$|On Thursday 20th, I was gratified for a {{few minutes}} with the {{luminous}} appearance described above [...] "such flashes of lightning from the west, repeated every two or three minutes, sometimes at shorter intervals, as appeared to illumine the whole heavens". It was about nine o'clock, P.M. I had no sooner got on horseback than I observed the tips of both the horse's ears to be quite luminous: the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hat had the same appearance. I was soon deprived of these luminaries by a shower of moist snow which immediately began to fall. The horse's ears soon became wet and lost their luminous appearance; but the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hat, being longer of getting wet, continued to give the luminous appearance somewhat longer.I could observe an immense number of minute sparks darting towards the horse's ears and the margin <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hat, which produced a very beautiful appearance, and I was sorry to be so soon deprived of it.The atmosphere in this neighbourhood appeared to be very highly electrified for eight or ten days about this time. Thunder was heard occasionally from 15th to 23d, during which time the weather was very unsteady: frequent showers of hail, snow, rain, &c.I can find no person in this quarter who remembers to have ever seen the luminous appearance mentioned above, before this season,—or such a quantity of lightning darting across the heavens,—nor who have heard so much thunder at that season of the year.This country being all stocked with sheep, and the herds having frequent occasion {{to pay attention to the}} state of the weather, it is not to be thought that such an appearance can have been at all frequent, and none of them to have observed it.

500|$|... "Blood Ties" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik {{described it}} as [...] "one of the most serious, frank and compelling discussions of race in any medium" [...] since an episode of NYPD Blue from 1995, in which actor Dennis Franz used the word [...] "nigger". Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "explosive (and) riveting", and wrote, [...] "The smart, darkly humorous writing on Homicide is as strong as ever. So are the performances of a superb ensemble of actors." [...] R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal praised the episodes and called them [...] "a complicated rumination on race and class". David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode had an unpredictability that helped maintain the show's vitality, and said {{of the first two}} episodes, [...] "Except for one moment in tonight's opener, I was on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat for the entire two hours; at that moment, a surprise shooting shocked me right onto my feet." [...] Newsday writer Verne Gay described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "brilliant drama" [...] and [...] "a superb piece of work (that) appears to be a novel variation on reverse discrimination". Regarding the first of the three episodes, Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark said Seda and Thorne had [...] "solid first impressions" [...] and that the episode arc [...] "has all the makings of another killer story line". Virginia Rohan of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, called the episode [...] "gripping" [...] and [...] "another strong start for a terrific series".|$|E
500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] {{on a scale of one}} to ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure yet whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E
500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> seat throughout." ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores {{how we can}} {{understand}} suicidal experience more fully, {{and what it means}} to reach the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> our understanding. It draws on the case of ‘Roddy’, a research participant whose account of his suicide attempt was marked by experiences of terror and horror. Drawing on phenomenological understandings about the epistemic importance of feelings, I make an argument that we need to critically explore our embodied intersubjective encounters and our emotional worlds, in order to more fully understand suicidal experience. Roddy’s traumatic suicide attempt is hard to communicate, but gaining others’ understanding is imperative for Roddy’s self-understanding and recovery. I consider the visceral and poetic language Roddy uses to help communicate the terror and horror of his experience. I then consider the implications of this – what happens to me, as the listener, when I reach the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> capacity for deep, authentic understanding. The chapter concludes with some thoughts about feelings, autobiographical narratives, and understanding. I suggest that our communities need to develop more spaces where people can talk about the terror and horror of their suicide attempts safely and openly. I conclude that researchers (and perhaps also clinicians) need to honestly interrogate what happens for them at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> their understanding, when listening to such accounts...|$|R
60|$|As {{the freight}} {{got out of}} Philadelphia she began to hit up speed. Then I {{understood}} what the shack had meant by suicide. The freight went faster and faster. She was a through freight, {{and there was nothing}} to stop her. On that section of the Pennsylvania four tracks run side by side, and my east-bound freight didn't need to worry about passing west-bound freights, nor about being overtaken by east-bound expresses. She had the track to herself, and she used it. I was in a precarious situation. I stood with the mere <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feet on the narrow projections, the palms <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands pressing desperately against the flat, perpendicular ends of each car. And those cars moved, and moved individually, up and down and back and forth. Did you ever see a circus rider, standing on two running horses, with one foot on the back of each horse? Well, that was what I was doing, with several differences. The circus rider had the reins to hold on to, while I had nothing; he stood on the broad soles of his feet, while I stood on the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> mine; he bent his legs and body, gaining the strength of the arch in his posture and achieving the stability of a low centre of gravity, while I was compelled to stand upright and keep my legs straight; he rode face forward, while I was riding sidewise; and also, if he fell off, he'd get only a roll in the sawdust, while I'd have been ground to pieces beneath the wheels.|$|R
