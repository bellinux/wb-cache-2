5|$|The LCS {{attempted}} passive deception {{as part of}} Hardboiled. Agents canvassed Norwegian refugees {{for information}} about Stavanger and for possible interpreters.

5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the French East India Company, {{supported by a}} garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E

5|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler {{intended}} {{that the}} new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered {{by members of the}} SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability to quote the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E
5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by the Spartans {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging the Spartans, Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time to extricate the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was set upon by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged the Spartans with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E

25|$|Many in the American mission—Martin in particular—along {{with some}} key figures in Washington, {{believed}} that {{negotiations with the}} communists were possible, especially if Saigon could stabilize the military situation.

25|$|In 2007, Khamenei {{requested}} that government officials speed up Iran's move towards economic privatization. Its last move towards such a goal was in 2004, when Article 44 {{of the constitution}} was overturned. Article 44 had decreed that Iran's core infrastructure should remain state-run. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights should be protected in courts {{set up by the}} Justice Ministry; the <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this new protection would give a measure of security to and encourage private investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} {{opted to}} use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn.

The <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a ceiling on corn prices would provide incentive for the market to lower all prices nationally.|$|E

25|$|A {{few hours}} elapsed until Mackall {{was able to}} decide what to do next. Realizing that his {{position}} was hopeless, he put the men on the mainland in motion in the direction of Tiptonville. The motion was detected by Pope's spies, who gave the information to Pope. Pope then diverted his soldiers to Tiptonville, and the operation became a footrace rather than the expected battle. Mackall's only <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the gunboats would not interfere, but they did, and the retreat of his army was delayed long enough for Pope's men to get to Tiptonville first. The defenders were trapped, with no prospect of victory, so Mackall decided to surrender.|$|E

25|$|Projects TIP TOW and Tom-Tom {{involved}} docking F-84s to the wingtips of B-29s and B-36s. The <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the increased}} aspect {{ratio of the}} combined aircraft {{would result in a}} greater range. Project TIP TOW was canceled when an EF-84D and a specially modified test EB-29A crashed, killing everyone on both aircraft. This accident was attributed to the EF-84D flipping over onto the wing of the EB-29A. Project Tom-Tom, involving RF-84Fs and a GRB-36D from the FICON project (redesignated JRB-36F), continued for a few months after this crash, but was also canceled due to the violent turbulence induced by the wingtip vortices of the B-36.|$|E
25|$|Although World War II had {{interrupted}} {{production of}} the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation boom. Thousands {{of men and women}} were trained as pilots by the government, and the <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would want to include flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day, operating three shifts per day. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men's department of the Macy's department store chain.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, {{introduced}} CaCO3 {{into the}} Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts. His <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the calcium carbonate would counter the acid {{in the stream}} from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did {{increase the amount of}} aluminium ions {{in the area of the}} brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO3 can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such liming has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.|$|E
