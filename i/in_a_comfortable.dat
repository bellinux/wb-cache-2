5|$|O'Reilly was {{selected}} for the tour of England in 1934, where he and Grimmett were the bowling stars as Australia regained the Ashes. They began by taking 19 of the 20 England wickets to fall <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> victory in the First Test at Trent Bridge. O'Reilly's match figures were 11 wickets for 129 runs, and taking seven for 54 in his second innings was to produce his best Test figures.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not {{sufficiently}} established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E

5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played for}} Cambridge in 1922. He was {{left out of}} the team's first game; as the University was playing Middlesex, he played for the {{opposition}} instead and took six for 13. Around this time, he began to bowl fast for the first time. After success in the following games—including ten wickets in the game against Sussex—Allen was awarded his blue by being selected for the University Match against Oxford at Lord's. In that game, he had match figures of nine for 78 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> Cambridge victory. This was Cambridge's last game of the season—Allen had taken 49 first-class wickets at an average of 15. There were suggestions in the press at the time that Allen illegally threw, rather than bowled, the ball. In his biography of Allen, E. W. Swanton writes that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen's career, and that they may have resulted from a one-off lapse. Towards the end of the season, Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him {{at the top of the}} county's bowling averages.|$|E

25|$|In 1999–2000, {{consolidation}} {{was supposed}} to be the key, but once again plans were interrupted by injury. The Intertoto and UEFA Cup expedition took a lot out of the players – but the team started the season sharper than the others, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> upper-midtable position by the halfway point of the season. Tiredness, loss of form and a build-up of injuries resulted in a slide downwards towards the end of the season, eventually resulting in a ninth-place finish and a third consecutive year in the top half.|$|E

Johansson afterwards admitted himself tempted to take part in Elitloppet once more. Four weeks later, Victory Tilly raced in the big one-mile race. However, Adielsson and the gelding had no success in the eliminations, as French Jag de Bellouet interfered with them.|$|E
