500|$|After {{arriving}} in Harlem, Sims began performing {{on the street}} {{as he had done}} in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: [...] "I knew people who danced on <b>dinner</b> <b>plates...</b> There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on." [...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, {{there was nothing in the}} audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo.By the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed [...] "executioner", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as [...] "the hook") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play [...] "executioner" [...] until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|The Keeleys {{arrive at}} the Goldmans' (who are calling {{themselves}} [...] "Coleman" [...] for the evening to hide their Jewish heritage) redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is passing himself off as a Greek butler named [...] "Spartacus" [...] for the night.

2500|$|In July 1865, President Andrew Johnson asked Haughwout & Co. {{to make an}} {{inventory}} of the White House china and silver, and to make replacements as necessary. Congress subsequently made a $30,000 appropriation {{at the end of}} 1865 to pay for the general refurbishment of the house (which included the china and silver replacements). The administration replaced the entire [...] "solferino" [...] china set with an identical set on January 17, 1866, also manufactured by Haviland and decorated by E. V. Haughwout and Company. This china is different from the 1861 set, as both the outline and the colors were done by hand (no stencil was used). [...] This second order of [...] "Lincoln china" [...] consisted of 391 pieces, and included pickle dishes, custard cups, egg cups, serving dishes of various depths, compote dishes, sugar bowls, baskets, butter dishes, <b>dinner</b> <b>plates,</b> dessert plates, tea plates, soup plates, preserve plates, breakfast coffee cups, regular coffee cups, tea cups, water pitchers, and one salad bowl, cake plate, and ice bowl. There is little documentary evidence, but oral tradition claims that E.V. Haughwout contracted with Edward Lycett, the most famous china painter in the United States at the time, to decorate the china. Glassware was also reordered from Haughwout & Co. in 1866, and manufactured by the New England Glass Co. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E

6000|$|Though Juanita Haydock {{was highly}} {{advanced}} in the matters of finger-bowls, doilies, and bath-mats, her [...] "refreshments" [...] were typical {{of all the}} afternoon-coffees.

Then they distributed hot buttered rolls, coffee poured from an enamel-ware pot, stuffed olives, potato salad, and angel's-food cake. There was, {{even in the most}} strictly conforming Gopher Prairie circles, a certain option as to collations. The olives need not be stuffed. Doughnuts were in some houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls. But there was in all the town no heretic save Carol who omitted angel's-food.|$|E
60|$|It pleased me, {{that thought}} did; and as I {{never was a}} man to let a thought sleep (you must wake up all the whole family of {{thoughts}} you've got and burn their nightcaps, or you won't do in the Cheap Jack line), I set to work at it. Considering that I was {{in the habit of}} changing so much about the country, and that I should have to find out a literary character here to make a deal with, and another literary character there to make a deal with, as opportunities presented, I hit on the plan that this same book should be a general miscellaneous lot,--like the razors, flat-iron, chronometer watch, <b>dinner</b> <b>plates,</b> rolling-pin, and looking- glass,--and shouldn't be offered as a single indiwidual article, like the spectacles or the gun. When I had come to that conclusion, I come to another, which shall likewise be yours.|$|E
60|$|But I {{said the}} effect of its being so filled, because this, again, {{is of the essence}} of good design. With a simple spray of leaves and a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the {{impression}} that he has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place them. All good design depends on the texture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to. One of the first things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish, and another young lady covering a set of <b>dinner</b> <b>plates</b> with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paint them on <b>dinner</b> <b>plates</b> or dishes. Let them take canvas or paper for such work, but not clay or china. They are merely painting the wrong subjects on the wrong material, that is all. They have not been taught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own. The design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design which you should work on a flat table- cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design. One does not want to eat one's terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor one's clams off a harrowing sunset. Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be {{on the walls of the}} rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.|$|E

40|$|The brief was {{to produce}} a range of {{affordable}} and functional products for everyday use. Research undertaken {{in response to the}} brief significantly addressed the needs of the consumer. The range was designed so that it could be manufactured across a number of factories: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Vietnam and China, thus, allowing the volumes to be achieved without completely overrunning one factory with one range. The designing of each article considered the most effective production method. Also stacking of each product was a necessary part of the design brief, this facilitates ease of storage and transportation. Stacking of objects is particularly challenging but necessary for economic and environmental policies. The range also offers the same design in a number of materials: stoneware, earthenware, and glass and a number of glaze and/or glass colours and patterns. This provides different price points and also a variety of aesthetics and consumer choice. The overall aesthetic is clean-cut, which provides simplicity and easy accessibility for the consumer but also a plain surface for the addition of pattern. A workshop with Kevin Gould, the chef, food critic and food trend analyst, enabled design teams to assess current food trends helpful to designing products appropriate to the food customers are buying. Research showed that although traditional and cultural dishes remained a mainstay in consumers’ eating habits, there was a predominant demand for pasta, pizza, rice and noodle dishes particularly Indian and Thai curry. Consumers were also seeking tableware to reflect the trans-cultural character of these dishes: large 30 cm flat pizza plates, generous pasta bowls, deep bowls for noodles, and square and rectangular dishes to mimic Oriental styles. Further research into market and product availability at major international trade fairs allowed us to assess the gaps in the current market.
