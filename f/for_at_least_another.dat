5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>another</b> year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>another</b> decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E
5|$|The stele almost {{certainly}} did not originate {{in the town of}} Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner.

50|$|There {{are only}} a couple ways to manage Colletotrichum trifolii. The first way is to start {{scouting}} right away in early summer.

40|$|With {{an annual}} growth {{rate of more than}} 9. 6 percent in real terms over three decades from 1979 to 2010, China has emerged as the second largest economy and largest {{exporter}} in the world. The so called China’s economic miracle has attracted tremendous international academic attentions despite no consensus has been so far reached for its substitutability. The sources of the China’s economic miracle have been perceived as a result of rapid structural change, effective catching up and effective exploitation of comparative advantage by some (e. g. Holz 2008), {{and as a result of}} massive inward FDI and export-led growth by others (e. g. Whalley and Xin 2010). While the former school believes that China’s growth pattern is sustainable <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> two to three decades, the later school is suspicious on its sustainability when the demand for the Chinese exports shrinks during the global economic crisis. The pessimistic view is getting popular with the appreciation of RMB accelerated since the second half of 2010. In a basis of a detailed review of the current literature on the sustainability of the China’s economic miracle and with the help of a simple macro-econometric model (the Fair Model), several economic scenarios are examined and forecasted up to 2020. According to the result of the experiments, the slowing down of the export-led growth, materialized with continued depreciations of the RMB by an annual rate of 4 percent up to 2015 when a new value of 5. 016 is reached could be disastrous. As a result, the past experience of high growth rate could be significantly reduced. Alternatively, a deepening in reforms in the domestic economy, characterized as increases in government purchases in the domestic market, and encouraging both domestic demand and exports could relieve some of the pressures of RMB appreciation, but the expansionary fiscal policy itself may not be sufficient to sustain the past economic experience...|$|R

40|$|We used a {{class of}} {{designed}} peptide detergents to stabilize photosystem I (PS-I) upon extended drying under N 2 on a gold-coated-Ni-NTA glass surface. PS-I is a chlorophyll-containing membrane protein complex that is the primary reducer of ferredoxin and the electron acceptor of plastocyanin. We isolated the complex from the thylakoids of spinach chloroplasts using a chemical detergent. The chlorophyll molecules associated with the PS-I complex provide an intrinsic steady-state emission spectrum between 650 and 800 nm at − 196. 15 °C that reflects {{the organization of the}} pigment-protein interactions. In the absence of detergents, a large blue shift of the fluorescence maxima from approximately 735 nm to approximately 685 nm indicates a disruption in light-harvesting subunit organization, thus revealing chlorophyll−protein interactions. The commonly used membrane protein-stabilizing detergents, N-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside and N-octyl-β-D-glucoside, only partially stabilized the approximately 735 -nm complex with approximately 685 -nm spectroscopic shift. However, prior to drying, addition of the peptide detergent acetyl- 					AAAAAAK at increasing concentration significantly stabilized the PS-I complex. Moreover, in the presence of acetyl- 					AAAAAAK, the PS-I complex is stable in a dried form <b>at</b> room temperature <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 3 wk. <b>Another</b> peptide detergent, acetyl-VVVVVVD, also stabilized the complex but to a lesser extent.

However, {{little is known}} about how patient knowledge and outcome expectations may influence antidepressant adherence {{and persistence}}. Method: Individuals who had been prescribed their first antidepressant to treat depression in the preceding 6  months were recruited to an online survey via Facebook. Knowledge, education received, and initial outcome expectations were analyzed for associations with persistence and adherence. Results: Two hundred and twenty surveys were analyzed. A total of 117 participants had taken their antidepressant <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 3  months; <b>another</b> 25 had never started or stopped after < 3  months without consulting their doctor. Differences in expectations and various educational messages among persistent and nonpersistent participants were identified. Having received the instruction “don’t stop it without checking with your doctor” was a significant independent predictor of persistence (odds ratio [OR] = 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 4 – 24. 5). At the time of the survey, 82. 7 % of participants were taking an antidepressant and 77. 9 % were adherent. Significant independent predictors of adherence were a greater age (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 0 – 1. 2), knowledge (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 2. 3), being informed of common side effects (OR = 5. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 29. 0), and having discussed ways to solve problems (OR = 3. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 14. 5). Conclusion: Improving outcome expectations and particular educational messages may increase adherence and persistence. Greater knowledge may enhance adherence. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether a focus on these simple educational messages will improve outcomes in patients who commence an antidepressant.

40|$|Catalysis {{using an}} {{inverted}} scCO 2 /H 2 O biphasic system where the catalyst is immobilized in scCO 2 as stationary phase and the substrate and product {{are contained in}} the aqueous phase, offers an interesting alternative to classical biphasic systems and enables the conversion of polar substrates, using scCO 2 as solvent. As many fine chemicals and biological active compounds are hydrophilic in nature, a method for synthesizing these products without the problems of isolation and catalyst recycling forms an attractive possibility. The use of scCO 2 as solvent reduces gas-liquid-liquid mass transfer limitations and eliminates cross-contamination of organic solvents into the aqueous layer. The catalyst is easily recycled without depressurising the autoclave by removal of the aqueous layer via a needle valve followed by addition of the next batch of substrate using a HPLC pump. The aim of this thesis {{was to examine the}} application of an inverted scCO 2 /H 2 O biphasic system. After allocation of an applicable catalyst and set-up of the reactor, the general practice of the system and the ability to recycle the catalyst was tested in case of the hydrogenation of itaconic acid as model substrate. Several CO 2 -philic rhodium-complexes were used. The best results were achieved using the fluorinated phosphine ligand 3 -H 2 F 6 TPP and [Rh(cod) 2]BF 4. With a rodium:ligand:substrate ratio of 1 : 5 : 200, a conversion of 95 % after 1 h reaction time was reached. Under the chosen conditions, the catalyst could be recycled <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three times. A turnover number of 800 was reached. After this, the optimization of reaction parameters occurred and other polar substrates were used. Then, enantioselective Hydrogenation was accomplished, leading to excellent results when (R,S) - 3 -H 2 F 6 -BINAPHOS-modified rhodium complexes were used. Hydrogenation of itaconic acid led to an enantiomeric excess of 97 - 98 % ee (S) at full conversion and with recycling of the catalyst. Hydrogenation of Methyl- 2 -acetamidoacrylate gave full conversion and an enantiomeric excess of > 98 % ee (R) <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five cycles. <b>Another</b> subject was the determination of solubility in scCO 2, as the catalyst solubility plays an important role for the application of the inverted scCO 2 /H 2 O biphasic system.
