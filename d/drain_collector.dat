40|$|The paper aims at {{presentation}} {{of the effect of}} changes in the catchment area management on the value of water quality physicochemical indices {{along the length of the}} Iwoniczanka stream, which flows through Iwonicz-Zdrój, one of the oldest health resorts in Poland. Analyses of 14 water quality indices were conducted from November 2013 to May 2014 in five measurement points: two situated in the upper course of the stream – in forest areas, two located in the area of Iwonicz-Zdrój town, and one below the rural built-up area. On the basis of the conducted data analysis it was found that the mean values of pH, electrolytic conductivity, sulphates, calcium, total iron and manganese were increasing with the course of flowing water, as evidenced by the water enrichment in substances which had their sources in built-up areas. On average, the highest values of biogenic indices and chlorides but the lowest values of oxygen indices were registered immediately below the location of <b>drain</b> <b>collector</b> from the closed sewage treatment plant, which resulted in pollution of the analysed stream bed with the substances previously drained from the treatment plant. Water flowing through the forest areas had the maximum ecological potential in the built-up areas and due to phosphate concentrations it was classified to class II and then, due to self-purification, returned to the physicochemical parameters appropriate for class I water. The conducted hydro-chemical tests confirmed a significant negative effect of built-up areas on the quality of the flowing waters...|$|E
40|$|Os solos afetados por sais sÃo conhecidos hÃ muito tempo, no entanto, sua extensÃo e intensidade tÃm aumentado consideravelmente, resultando na expansÃo da Ãrea degradada por salinidade e sodicidade. Assim, prÃticas de manejo adequadas para controlar a salinidade dos solos tornam-se fundamentais principalmente visando Ã sustentabilidade, alÃm de constituÃrem alternativas de uso e recuperaÃÃo do solo. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o uso integrado de prÃticas de manejo na recuperaÃÃo de um solo salino-sÃdico no PerÃmetro Irrigado Curu-Pentecoste, CearÃ, e em seguida proceder uma anÃlise de viabilidade econÃmica, utilizando indicadores de rentabilidade do processo de recuperaÃÃo. O estudo foi desenvolvido em uma Ãrea cultivada com coqueiro com cerca de 2 anos de idade e que se encontrava com desenvolvimento bastante reduzido. Inicialmente foi instalado um sistema de drenagem subterrÃneo constituÃdo de um dreno coletor aberto de 135 m, dez drenos laterais de 45 m, compostos por tubos drenoflex DN 65 mm, manta bidim OP- 20 e uma caixa de brita nÂ 01. O experimento com culturas anuais foi instalado entre as fileiras de coqueiro, com os tratamentos sendo dispostos em um delineamento em blocos casualizados, em parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetiÃÃes, durante dois ciclos (2009 / 2010 e 2010 / 2011). As parcelas foram formadas pelos tratamentos: T 1. Subsolagem (S); T 2. S + 20 Mg ha- 1 de gesso; T 3. S + 40 Mg ha- 1 de matÃria orgÃnica; T 4. S + 10 Mg ha- 1 de gesso + 20 Mg ha- 1 de matÃria orgÃnica; T 5. S + 20 Mg ha- 1 de gesso + 40 Mg ha- 1 de matÃria orgÃnica, e as subparcelas corresponderam Ãs rotaÃÃes culturais algodÃo-feijÃo-de-corda (AL/FC) e girassol-feijÃo-decorda (GI/FC). A utilizaÃÃo da subsolagem juntamente com a instalaÃÃo do sistema de drenagem subterrÃneo proporcionou um rebaixamento mÃdio do lenÃol freÃtico de 0, 3 m e promoveu melhorias nas condiÃÃes fÃsicas do solo aumentando a condutividade hidrÃulica. A produÃÃo do coqueiro desde a primeira colheita realizada apresentou evoluÃÃo crescente passando de 33, 3 fruto/planta/ano em 2010 / 2011 para 152, 4 frutos/planta/ ano em 2011 / 2012. Os resultados demonstram que o emprego dos corretivos quÃmicos e orgÃnicos contribuiu para a diminuiÃÃo dos nÃveis de salinidade e sodicidade do solo, sendo seus efeitos mais evidenciados para reduÃÃo da sodicidade, com o gesso se mostrando mais eficiente nesse processo. As maiores doses de gesso e matÃria orgÃnica aplicadas no tratamento T 5 promoveram a maior produtividade do girassol e do feijÃo-de-corda. NÃo se observou diferenÃas na produÃÃo de matÃria seca da parte aÃrea entre as espÃcies nos dois anos de cultivo; no entanto, no ciclo 2010 / 2011 observou-se um aumento mÃdio de 114 % (algodÃo) e 89 % (girassol) na produÃÃo de matÃria seca, em relaÃÃo ao ciclo 2009 / 2010, sendo um indicativo da recuperaÃÃo progressiva do solo. Observaram diferenÃas estatÃsticas nas mediÃÃes de condutÃncia estomÃtica e das taxas de fotossÃntese e de transpiraÃÃo apenas entre Ãpocas de mediÃÃes. Os teores foliares de Na+ nas plantas de girassol e algodÃo foram reduzidos de um cultivo para outro, principalmente nos tratamentos com aplicaÃÃo de gesso. O processo de recuperaÃÃo apresentou viabilidade econÃmica Ã taxa de juros de 2 % ao ano, {{conforme}} caracterÃsticas do agricultor familiar assistido pelo PRONAF. No entanto, o resultado sÃ foi possÃvel com a contribuiÃÃo da produÃÃo do coqueiro, haja vista que produÃÃo do algodÃo, girassol e feijÃo-de-corda nÃo foram suficientes para amortizar os investimentos. The salt affected {{soils are}} {{known for a long}} time, however, the scale and intensity have increased considerably, resulting in the expansion of the area degraded by salinity and sodicity. Thus, appropriate management practices to control soil salinity become fundamental mainly aimed at sustainability, as well as being alternative uses and land reclamation. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the integrated use of management practices in the reclamation of a saline-sodic soil in the irrigated Perimeter Curu-Pentecoste, CearÃ, and then carried out an economic viability analysis, using profitability indicators of process of reclamation. The study was conducted in an area cultivated with coconut with 2 years old, with the plants showing delayed development. Initially it was installed a subsurface drainage system consisting of an open <b>drain</b> <b>collector</b> of 135 m, ten side drains of 45 m, composed of pipes Drenoflex DN 65 mm, manta bidim OP- 20 and a box of gravel No. 01. The experiment was installed with annual crops between rows of coconut, with treatments being arranged in a randomized block design in a split plot design with four replications during two cycles (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011). The plots were formed by the treatments: T 1. Subsoiling (S), T 2. S + 20 Mg ha- 1 gypsum, T 3. S + 40 Mg ha- 1 of organic matter; T 4. S + 10 Mg ha- 1 gypsum + 20 Mg ha- 1 of organic matter; T 5. S + 20 Mg ha- 1 gypsum + 40 Mg ha- 1 of organic matter. The subplots correspond to two crop rotation systems: cotton-cowpea (AL / FC) and sunflower-cowpea (GI / FC). The use of subsoiling along with the installation of subsurface drainage system provided an average drawdown of the water table of 0. 3 m promoted improvements in soil physical conditions by increasing the hydraulic conductivity. The production of coconut from the first sample taken showed increasing trend from 33. 3 fruit / plant / year in 2010 / 2011 to 152. 4 fruits / plant / year in 2011 / 2012. The results demonstrate that the use of gypsum and organic matter contributed to the decreased levels of salinity and sodicity, and their effects are more evident for reducing sodicity, with gypsum proving more efficient in this process. The highest rates of gypsum and organic matter applied in the treatment T 5 promoted greater productivity for sunflower and cowpea. There were no differences in the shoots dry matter of the species within two years of cultivation, however, in the cycle 2010 / 2011 there was an average increase of 114 % (cotton) and 89 % (sunflower) relative to 2009 / 2010 cycle, being an indicative of the progressive recovery of the soil. Statistically significant difference in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration were observed only between seasons. Foliar concentrations of Na+ in plants of sunflower and cotton crops were reduced in the second cycle, relative to the first one, especially in the treatments with application of gypsum. The reclamation process showed economic viability at the rate of 2 % per year, according to the characteristics of the family farmer assisted by PRONAF. However, the result was only possible with the contribution of coconut production, considering that the production cotton, sunflower and cowpea were not enough to cover the investment...|$|E

40|$|Since the Middle Ages the Dutch have {{reclaimed}} many {{lakes and}} parts of the sea, creating polders. Drainage is required to use the land: for the inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was transferred into open <b>collector</b> <b>drains,</b> from where the water was pumped out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950 s, land use has been changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation, both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each agricultural plot. A new approach of ‘retention, storage and controlled removal’ is being used to develop climate adaptation scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i. e. : (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre, south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{introduction}} of lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has revealed previously unrecorded and unexpected pathways of lymphatic drainage of the integument. This has demanded a reappraisal of {{the anatomy of}} the lymphatic network since current knowledge {{is based on the}} works of Sappey performed in the 1870 s before radiology and microphotography. Our studies have focused on this problem: 1. To re-evaluate the lymphatic anatomy of the integument and thereby: 2. Validate or refute the technique of sentinel node biopsy. 3. Define previously unrecorded lymphatic pathways detected by SNB. 4. Compare the lymphatic and venous anatomy. 5. Help explain some unusual clinical findings of melanoma metastasis. 6. Provide new methods to treat lymphoedema. Methods: 1. Human cadaver lymphatic vessel detection with hydrogen peroxide, injection with a radiopaquelead oxide mixture, antegrade dissection of lymphatic pathways – recorded by photography and radiology; retrograde tracing from sentinel nodes to define lymphatic territories and venous injections with radiolucent dye or air for comparison. 2. Similar animal cadaver studies. 3. Immunohistochemistry of the lymphatic network in the mouse. Results: 1. Avalvular lymphatic capillaries connect the valved pre collecting and collecting lymphatics of adjacent lymphatic territories. 2. Collecting lymphatics have uniform diameter whereas veins enlarge as they <b>drain</b> proximally. 3. <b>Collectors</b> concentrate near major subcutaneous veins. 4. Sentinel node territories well defined in upper limb and chest, supporting SNB in these regions. Branching of collectors within territories is common but is rare between territories. 5. Head and neck territories variable with some regions draining to multiple sentinel nodes. 6. Breast drainage sometimes to single node other times to multiple sentinel nodes. The same pattern is found between the sexes. 7. Large axillary node often drained both upper limb and chest. 8. Retrograde pathways, via dermal capillaries, detected between obstructed and patent collectors in cadaver with previous axillary dissection – helps explain dermal seeding in melanoma metastases. 9. Occasional lymphatic-venous connections detected. 10. Collecting lymphatics detected accompanying perforating blood vessels to reach deep sentinel nodes that bypass the axilla and the groin.

40|$|Afforestation aims {{to recover}} the {{vegetation}} cover, and restore natural ecosystems. The plant species selected for restoration will determine species richness {{and the fate of}} the ecosystem. Research focussing on the impact of vegetation recovery on soil quality are abundant, especially on fire affected land and where rehabilitation, afforestation and restoration projects were carried out. However, little is known about how different plants species affect soil erosion and water losses, which are key factors that will impact the fate of the afforested land. Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis M.) is the species commonly used for afforestation in the Mediterranean and is very successful when natural recovery takes place, however, the original forests were composed of Holm oaks (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia L.). There is little information about the hydrological and erosional impact of this change of vegetation cover stimulated by a millennia old forest use in the Mediterranean, and a century old afforestation policies and natural recovery as a consequence of land abandonment. To get insights in the effect of plant species on runoff generation and soil erosion, individual trees should be selected. Plots of 1 m 2 are necessary to identify homogeneous patches, and were installed under Aleppo pine (4 plots) and Holm oaks (4 plots) in a 30 (34) -years old plant cover recovered after a forest fire that took place in 1979. A raingauge was installed in the study site to characterize the rainfall.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{high voltage}} power transistor is a vertical device. That is, {{one in which}} the current flow is vertical. This construction technique has evolved from both physical reasons and the relative ease of construction of these devices. Whether the device is a Field Effect Transister (FET) or a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), this vertical current flow results in the substrate, that part of the silicon wafer on which the device is built, being the <b>drain</b> or the <b>collector</b> terminal. If it is wished to integrate circuitry to control the power device on the same chip, the fact that the substrate is a terminal which can change its potential as the load or device characteristics are varied, presents severe common mode problems. A lateral transistor, one in which all terminals are {{on the top of the}} chip and the resultant current flow is lateral to the top, can alleviate these problems to some extent. While this construction technique is not common, numerous examples of these devices exist in the literature. Generally these devices are either low voltage units or, for a given value of voltage/current capability, they use considerably more chip surface than a comparable vertical device. In this study, a new lateral device, The LAteral Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or LABFET, is described. This device replaces the normal n+-drain diffusion, used in the typical Double Diffused MOS (DMOS) transistor with a p-type diffusion. This p-diffusion acts as the emitter of a low gain p- n-p bipolar transistor. The base of this device is the n-substrate or n-well, when the device is part of an integrated circuit. The base current is supplied by turning on the DMOS Field Effect Transistor. The result is a conductivity modulated device, with all terminals on the top of the chip, a voltage withstand capability of 100 V and an on-staAte conductance of. 71 Siemans per cm of gate width. This is comparable with conventional vertical FET devices. The static and dynamic characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 Unit cell 2 ̆ 2 devices are presented with an explanation of the results and a description of the processing to produce them. Finally, suggestions are made which would allow the extension of this concept to a large device suitable for integration into a power integrated circuit...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the release of phosphorus (P) to receiving waters resulting from harvesting 34 -year-old lodgepole pine trees in an upland peat catchment. The study site was within a 25. 3 -hectare (ha) area, and was drained by a stream that received flows from ploughed furrows, mainly, via <b>collector</b> <b>drains,</b> and discharged directly to the salmonid Shrahrevagh River, Burrishoole, Co. Mayo, Ireland. The study site was divided in two parts: the upstream part was left intact and the downstream part was harvested in early Autumn 2005 following implementation of forest guidelines. Good management practices such as proper use of brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented. Two instrumented stations were established – one just upstream (US) and the other just downstream (DS) of the clearfelled area. The measurement of P concentrations at the two stations commenced in May 2005, two months before the harvesting started. The daily mean P concentration at the DS station increased from about 6 μg L- 1 of total reactive phosphorus (TRP) during pre-clearfelling to 429 μg L- 1 in August 2006. By October 2009, four years after clearfelling, the P concentrations at the DS station had returned to pre-clearfelling levels. In the first three years after harvesting, up to 5. 15 kg ha- 1 of TRP were released from the harvested catchment to the receiving water; in the second year alone, 2. 3 kg ha- 1 of TRP were released. Linear regression can be used to describe the relationship between TRP load and water discharge. About 80 % of the total phosphorus (TP) in the study stream was soluble and more than 70 % of the P release occurred in storm events, indicating that traditional buffer strips with widths of 15 - 20 m might not be efficient for P immobilization. The P concentrations were affected by antecedent weather conditions and highest concentrations occurred during storm events following prolonged drought periods. The water extractable phosphorus (WEP) contents in the soil were significantly higher below windrow/brash material than in brash-free areas, and whole-tree harvesting should be studied as one of the means to decrease P export from blanket peats.

40|$|In {{a global}} perspective, the {{efficiency}} of nitrogen fertiliser use in agriculture is low. In Sweden the crop uptake of applied nitrogen fertiliser is about 70 %. The largest losses of nitrogen from arable land are due to leaching, soil erosion and gaseous emissions. Controlled drainage is a method that aims to improve water and nutrient use efficiency. The technique is simple and {{involves the use of}} weirs in the <b>collector</b> <b>drains</b> and thus damming the outlet of the drainage system, {{in order to reduce the}} outflow. Controlled drainage has been shown to have large effects on the quantity and quality of drain outflow by reducing the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus. A stated disadvantage with the system is that the emission of laughing gas (N 2 O) from arable land might increase. The aims of this literature review are to synthesise results from previous studies on N 2 O emission from arable land, illuminate the effects of different management options on levels of N 2 O emission, elucidate lack of knowledge and need of additional research and, finally, estimate expected N 2 O emission and reduced nitrogen leaching if controlled drainage are to be introduced in Sweden. Production and emission of N 2 O depend on the water content in soil, available nitrogen and carbon, pH, temperature, diffusion rate and gas exchange with the atmosphere. Different management options affect N 2 O emission, directly and indirectly, by affecting the nitrogen content in soil and the gas exchange with the atmosphere. The N 2 O emission rates varies depending on cultivated crop, fertilisation management, such as timing, rate, type and combinations of different types as well as with different soil tillage, drainage and irrigation techniques. Management options that aim at reducing N 2 O emission should first of all be to create optimal growing conditions for the crop. The only way to reduce nitrogen losses from arable land is by an efficient use of applied nitrogen. It is possible to decrease N 2 O emission by adjusting management options, such as fertilisation and irrigation, to actual crop and soil type, timing of soil tillage and, when using controlled drainage adjusting the groundwater level to for the season optimal levels. In general, there is a lack of knowledge of how different cropping systems affect N 2 O emission and more research is needed on the relation between N 2 O emission and harvest. It is as yet not possible to estimate the effects of controlled drainage on direct and indirect N 2 O emission, due to lack of knowledge of the capacity of the soil to store, transport and reduce produced N 2 O. Results from previous research show that controlled drainage can reduce nutrient leaching. The reduction of nitrogen loads can be large if controlled drainage is introduced on suitable land of the coastal areas of Southern Sweden. With less nitrogen leaching it is possible to reduce nitrogen fertilisation rates and thereby reduce direct and indirect N 2 O emission. In this study, the effects of controlled drainage have been calculated only on indirect N 2 O emissions due to lack of measured data. The background emissions are assumed to redouble. Estimated increase in indirect N 2 O emission, if controlled drainage is to be introduced, represents a value of 1 % of total N 2 O emission in Sweden per year...|$|R
