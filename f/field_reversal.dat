40|$|Vertically {{stratified}} shearing box {{simulations of}} magnetorotational turbulence commonly exhibit a so-called butterfly diagram of quasi-periodic azimuthal <b>field</b> <b>reversals.</b> However, {{in the presence}} of hydrodynamic convection, <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> no longer occur. Instead, the azimuthal field strength fluctuates quasi-periodically while maintaining the same polarity, which can either be symmetric or antisymmetric about the disc midplane. Using data from the simulations of Hirose et al. (2014), we demonstrate that the lack of <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> {{in the presence of}} convection is due to hydrodynamic mixing of magnetic field from the more strongly magnetized upper layers into the midplane, which then annihilate <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> that are starting there. Our convective simulations differ in several respects from those reported in previous work by others, in which stronger magnetization likely plays a more important role than convection.

5000|$|The {{electric}} convection {{field in}} the near Earth polar region can be simulated by eq. (...) with the exponent q = - 1/2. At the separatrix at Lm ,Φc is continuous. However, a <b>field</b> <b>reversal</b> takes place accompanied by field-aligned currents, both {{in agreement with the}} observations.The electric <b>field</b> <b>reversal</b> at Lm clearly indicates a reversal of the plasma drift within the inner and the polar magnetosphere. In a more sophisticated model, the auroral oval between about 15° and 20°colatitude (again simulated by a coaxial auroral zone), as a transition zone between the <b>field</b> <b>reversal,</b> has been taken into account. The ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 to 200 km altitude is a region where ions and electrons have different mobility. Thus the plasma becomes electrically conducting. Due to the geomagnetic field, two kinds of electric currents exist: Pedersen currents parallel to E, and Hall currents orthogonal to E and B. Moreover, a significant enhancement of the electric conductivity within the aurora area depending on geomagnetic activity exists which influences the parameter τco [...] in eq. (...) [...] The electric convection field drives strong electric currents within the polar dynamo regions (e.g. DP1 and DP2) which can be simulated by the model. Manifestations of upper atmospheric electric currents are the corresponding magnetic variations on the ground. Unfortunately, this connection is unique only for horizontally flowing current systems. E.g., the vertically flowing field-aligned currents have almost no magnetic effect on the ground. The model allows to separate the contributions of both kinds of electric currents. The polar magnetic disturbances DP2 are mainly Hall currents. The auroral electrojets (DP1) with magnitudes of the order of several hundreds of kA flowing within the aurora zones consist of Hall currents and Pedersen currents. Dissipation of the Pedersen currents produces Joule heating which is transferred to the neutral gas of the thermosphere thus generating thermospheric and ionospheric disturbances. Longer-lasting magnetospheric disturbances of the order of several hours to days can develop into global-scale thermospheric and ionospheric storms (e.g.,).|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{conducted}} {{measurements on}} 5,000 Rhizosolenia (a planktonic diatom) specimens from eight sedimentary cores in the Pacific Ocean. The core samples spanned two million years and were chronologized using sedimentary magnetic <b>field</b> <b>reversal</b> measurements. All the core samples yielded {{a similar pattern}} of divergence: with a single lineage (R. bergonii) occurring before 3.1 Mya and two morphologically distinct lineages (daughter species: R. praebergonii) appearing after. The parameters {{used to measure the}} samples were consistent throughout each core. An additional study of the daughter species R. praebergonii found that, after the divergence, it invaded the Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|By injecting {{electrons}} {{into the}} mirror before the fuel, the E-layer would create a second magnetic field that would cause the annular areas to fold back {{into the center of}} the tank. The resulting field was shaped like a tube, and very similar to the Field-Reversed Configuration, or FRC. The main difference between these devices is the way the <b>field</b> <b>reversal</b> is achieved; with the E-layer in the Astron, and by currents in the plasma for the FRC. Like the classic mirror, Astron injected the electrons {{into the mirror}} at a slight angle to ensure they would circulate {{into the center of the}} mirror.|$|E

The number of reversals decreases to zero with reduction of the seed strength, efficiency of the galactic dynamo {{and size of the}} spots of the seed field. A systematic observational search for magnetic <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> in a representative sample of spiral galaxies promises to give valuable information concerning seed magnetic fields and, in this way, to clarify the initial stages of galactic magnetic field evolution...|$|R
40|$|Soda-lime glass samples {{have been}} {{subjected}} to both single and double <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> during electric <b>field</b> assisted K+-Na+ ion exchanges in the temperature range 350 - 450 degrees C. Changes in refractive index profiles, chemical profiles and surface stress were observed during the exchanges and a comparison has been made with previous studies. It is shown that large reductions in surface stress seen after single <b>field</b> <b>reversals,</b> which have previously been attributed primarily to a stress relaxation mechanism, are mainly caused by the removal {{of a large number of}} K+ ions. For example, at 395 degrees C K+ ion removal accounts for 80 - 95 % of the stress reduction. It is shown that the drift-diffusion model of ion transport, using concentration-independent self-diffusion coefficients, cannot consistently model this large ion removal rate. A new model is developed which is based on drift-diffusion transport with concentration-dependent self-diffusion coefficients. The effects of double <b>field</b> <b>reversals</b> are also investigated. It is suggested that the glass may undergo an irreversible change associated with K+ ion removal...|$|R

(million years) to 70 Ma, largely in East Pacific Rise areas, although the marked increase in production rates of crustal material was also seen in the Gondwana ridges, as well as in oceanic plateaus. This period of increased crustal production is interpreted as a superplume event. This [...] "pulse" [...] of increased crustal production peaked soon after the initial plume (between 120 Ma and 100 Ma), and then declined over the next thirty million years. [...] Along with the increase in crustal output from ridges, there is an extended period in the time frame from 125 Ma to 40 Ma where the earth's magnetic <b>field</b> <b>reversal</b> frequency declines sharply.

40|$|We present {{axisymmetric}} numerical {{simulations of}} the solar interior, including the convection zone and an extended radiative interior.

Recently there has been interest in studying an important characteristic of the polar fields: the timing of the polar field reversals.

In the past, the reversals have been calculated by averaging the flux above some latitude (i. e. 55 deg or 75 deg). Alternatively, the reversal could be defined by the time in which the previous polarity is completely canceled and replaced by the new polarity at 90 de, precisely at the pole.
