5|$|However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne {{and colleagues}} revised the phylogenetic {{analysis}} published by Luo and colleagues, making several {{changes to the}} data, particularly in the monotremes. Their results (<b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with Ambondro most closely related to Asfaltomylos. In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, Henosferus, from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (<b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> top), but were ambivalent about the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned {{the presence of a}} true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare <b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of <b>figure</b> <b>3</b> and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in <b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of Hh (<b>Figure</b> <b>3),</b> a cell-surface transmembrane protein called Patched (PTCH) acts to prevent high {{expression}} and activity of a 7 membrane spanning receptor called Smoothened (SMO). Patched has sequence similarity to known membrane transport proteins. When extracellular Hh is present (<b>Figure</b> <b>3),</b> it binds to and inhibits Patched, allowing Smoothened to accumulate and inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of the Ci protein. This process most likely involves the direct interaction of Smoothened and Costal-2 and may involve sequestration of the Ci protein-containing complex to a microdomain where the steps leading to Ci protein proteolysis are disrupted. The mechanism by which Hh binding to Patched leads to increased levels of Smoothened is not clear (Step 1 in <b>Figure</b> <b>3).</b> Following binding of Hh to Patched, Smoothened levels increase greatly over the level maintained in cells when Patched is not bound to Hh. It {{has been suggested that}} phosphorylation of Smoothened plays a role in Hh-dependent regulation of Smoothened levels.|$|E

The total energy is numerically conserved in our computation when there is no blow-up (cf. <b>Figures</b> 2, <b>3)</b> and the discrete l 2 -norm ||ψ|| is numerically conserved very well whether there is blow-up or not (cf. <b>Figures</b> 2, <b>3,</b> 4).|$|R
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figure 2, these {{assumptions}} are not true in general because of the torpedo ballistic characteristics and torpedo tube parallax.

Most discussions of gyro angle determination take the simpler approach of using <b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> which is called the torpedo fire control triangle. <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> provides an accurate model for computing the gyro angle when the gyro angle is small, usually less than 30°.|$|E
25|$|If the {{wet method}} is used, the {{extractant}} is dissolved in an additional solvent prior to impregnation. The porous particles are then dispersed in the extractant-solvent solution. After soaking the particles, the excess solvent {{can either be}} filtered off or evaporated. In the first case, an extractant-solvent mixture would be retained within the pores. This would be of interest for extractants which would be solid at design conditions when pure. In the second case, only the extractant would remain inside the pores. <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> shows porous particles dispersed in an aqueous solution after wet impregnation. The cut-out in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> shows an enlarge segment of the surface of such an impregnated particle.|$|E

40|$|The bare {{diffusion}} coefficient is given {{as the time}} integral of the peculiar velocity autocorrelation function or PVACF and this result {{is different from the}} well known Green-Kubo formula. The bare {{diffusion coefficient}} characterizes the diffusion process on a length scale lambda. The PVACF is given {{here for the first time}} in terms of the positions and velocities of the N particles of the system so the PVACF is in a form suitable for evaluation by molecular dynamics simulations. The computer simulations show that for the two dimensional hard disk system, the PVACF decays increasingly rapidly in time as lambda is reduced and this is probably a general characteristic.
