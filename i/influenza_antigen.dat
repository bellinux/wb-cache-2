40|$|Effective {{vaccination}} {{against influenza}} virus infection {{is a serious}} problem mainly due to antigenic variability of the virus. Among many of investigated antigens, the extracellular domain of the M 2 protein (M 2 e) features high homology in all strains of influenza A viruses and antibodies against M 2 e and is protective in animal models; this makes it a potential candidate for generation of a universal influenza vaccine. However, due to the low immunogenicity of the M 2 e, formulation of a vaccine based on this antigen requires some modification to induce effective immune responses. In this work we evaluated the possible use of Bacillus subtilis spores as a carrier of the Influenza A M 2 e antigen in mucosal vaccination. A tandem repeat of 4 consensus sequences coding for human-avian-swine-human M 2 e (M 2 eH-A-S-H) peptide was fused to spore coat proteins and stably exposed on the spore surface, as demonstrated by the immunostaining of intact, recombinant spores.

40|$|When {{targeting}} mucosal pathogens, it {{is generally}} accepted that vaccination at mucosal sites will generate a more efficient mucosal immune response. As influenza is an infection of the airways, a vaccine that targets the actual site of infection should result in a more efficient immune response {{as compared to the}} conventionally delivered vaccines. The lungs are continuously exposed to environmental antigens and allergens, and the induction of immune responses against these molecules would result in continuous immune stimulation, which would eventually harm the host. As a result, immune responses in the lungs need to be tightly regulated to prevent a hypersensitive response leading to inflammation. Exposure of antigens to the lung often leads to induction of tolerance rather than immunisation, therefore, the lung {{may not be the most}} obvious site for induction of mucosal immunity. For a pulmonary vaccine to work, this tolerance first needs to be understood and overcome so that a protective immune response can be generated. In order to develop a pulmonary vaccine, the challenge of inducing immunity rather than tolerance must be overcome. The specific aims of this thesis were to i) determine if mucosal tolerance is induced in the lung following exposure to <b>influenza</b> <b>antigen</b> without an adjuvant, and if so what this mechanism is, and ii) determine the mechanism responsible for avoiding this tolerance leading to an immune response after pulmonary vaccination with an influenza ISCOMATRIX(TM) vaccine. Pulmonary vaccines were delivered to sheep, and antibody titres in both the lung and the blood were determined through ELISA. Tolerance-associated markers and cytokines were also measured after vaccination through the use of qPCR. It was found that if sheep were vaccinated with an initial dose of <b>influenza</b> <b>antigen</b> followed by an influenza ISCOMATRIX(TM) vaccine, the antibody response generated was significantly reduced compared to animals that received an influenza ISCOMATRIX(TM) vaccine only. Results suggest that this initial exposure to <b>influenza</b> <b>antigen</b> may cause a tolerizing effect in the lung. In contrast, the expression of the regulatory T-cell marker FOXP 3 and regulatory cytokines (associated with the induction of tolerance) were significantly reduced in vaccinated animals in the presence of adjuvant, indicating that regulatory T-cells may need to be suppressed in order to generate an efficient immune response. This decrease in a regulatory response should indicate the production of either cell-mediated or a humoral immune response, however, it was found that neither a Th 1, Th 2, or Th 17 response was generated following pulmonary vaccination with an influenza ISCOMATRIX(TM) vaccine. In the long-term, it is hoped that these improvements might contribute towards making lung-delivery of influenza vaccines a more feasible option in humans. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Influenza virus {{infection}} is diagnosed {{in most cases}} using a rapid <b>influenza</b> <b>antigen</b> diagnostic test (RIDT). However, false-negative results are a major concern.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} murine natural killer (NK) cells in the control of influenza virus infection, notably through the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp 46. However, {{little is known about}} the involvement of NK cells in human influenza infection. Here, we show that upon in vitro exposure to influenza, NKp 46 expression on NK cells decreases, whereas expression of 2 B 4, an activating receptor that can enhance natural cytotoxicity in synergy with NKp 46, is up-regulated. Consistent with these observations, NKp 46 dull and 2 B 4 bright NK cells had a higher functional activity in response to influenza than NK cells expressing high levels of NKp 46 or low levels of 2 B 4, respectively. Importantly, we assessed whether the expression of these receptors was also modified in vivo in response to <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens</b> and showed that an increase in 2 B 4 -expressing NK cells and a decrease in NKp 46 + NK cells occurred following intramuscular influenza vaccination. Altogether, our results further suggest that NKp 46 may play an important role in the innate immune response to human influenza and reveal that exposure to <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens</b> is associated with a previously unrecognized increase in 2 B 4 expression that can impact NK cell activity against the virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{evolution of}} highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) highlights {{the need for}} novel vaccination techniques that can be quickly and effectively employed to respond to emerging viral threats. We evaluated the use of optimized consensus <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens</b> to provide broad protection against divergent strains of H 5 N 1 influenza in three animal models of mice, ferrets, and non-human primates. We also evaluated the use of in vivo electroporation to deliver these vaccines to overcome the immunogenicity barrier encountered in vaccinating against H 5 N 1 influenza in addition to larger animal models of DNA vaccination. By combining several consensus <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens</b> with in vivo electroporation, we demonstrate that these antigens induce both protective cellular and humoral immune responses in mice, ferrets and non-human primates. In addition, the antibodies induced by the synthetic consensus H 5 hemagglutinin were able to inhibit both clade-matched and highly divergent H 5 N 1 influenza viruses. We also demonstrate the ability of these antigens to protect from both morbidity and mortality in a ferret model of HPAI, {{in addition to the}} inhibition of viral replication in a non-human primate model, in both the presence and absence of neutralizing antibody, which will be critical in responding to the antigenic drift that will likely occur before these viruses cross the species barrier to humans. ...|$|R
40|$|Local mucosal IgA {{antibodies}} play {{a central}} role in protection of the respiratory tract against influenza virus infection. Therefore, new-generation influenza vaccines should aim at stimulating not only systemic, but also local antibody responses. Previously, we demonstrated that the recombinant B subunit of the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LTB) is a potent adjuvant towards nasally administered <b>influenza</b> subunit <b>antigen.</b> Here, we investigated the protection conferred by LTB-supplemented <b>influenza</b> subunit <b>antigen</b> given intranasally (i. n.) or intramuscularly (i. m.) to mice. Both i. n. and i. m. immunization with subunit antigen and LTB completely protected the animals against viral infection. Protection upon i. n. immunization was associated with the induction of antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA, whereas protection upon i. m. immunization correlated with strong serum and mucosal IgG, but not IgA responses. We conclude that LTB-supplemented <b>influenza</b> subunit <b>antigen,</b> given either i. n. or i. m, induces protective antibody-mediated mucosal immunity and thus represents a promising novel flu vaccine candidate.

40|$|This study {{examined}} specific antibody and T cell responses associated with experimental malaria infection or malaria vaccination, in malaria-naive human volunteers within phase I/IIa vaccine trials, {{with a view}} to investigating inter-relationships between these types of response. Malaria infection was via 5 bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitos, with individuals reaching patent infection by 11 - 12 days, having harboured 4 - 5 blood stage cycles prior to drug clearance. Infection elicited a robust antibody response against Merozoite Surface Protein- 119, correlating with parasite load. Classical class switching was seen from an early IgM to an IgG 1 -dominant response of increasing affinity. Malaria-specific T cell responses were detected in the form of IFNγ and IL- 4 ELIspot, but their magnitude did not correlate with magnitude of antibody or its avidity, or with parasite load. Different individuals who were immunized with a virosome vaccine comprising <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens</b> combined with P. falciparum antigens, demonstrated pre-existing IFNγ, IL- 2 and IL- 5 ELIspot responses against the <b>influenza</b> <b>antigens,</b> and showed boosting of anti-influenza T cell responses only for IL- 5. The large IgG 1 -dominated anti-parasite responses showed limited correlation with T cell responses for magnitude or avidity, both parameters being only negatively correlated for IL- 5 secretion versus anti-Apical Membrane Antigen- 1 antibody titres.
