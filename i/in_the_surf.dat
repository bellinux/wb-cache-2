5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf.</b> Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try to pull her off. The attempts to refloat her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf.</b> The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E

5|$|Born in Temora, New South Wales, {{near the}} {{regional}} centre of Wagga Wagga, Kerry {{was one of}} two sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. Kerry was taught to swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke. Kerry grew up participating {{in a wide range of}} sports, representing Wollongong High School in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of Wollongong, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much more exciting due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooperwho went on to win the 400m freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympicswas living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the following year. At the time of his move, Kerry was ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.|$|E

25|$|The {{surf zone}} is place of {{convergence}} of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds {{to the beach}} and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.|$|E

25|$|Wave {{breaking}} intensity {{measures the}} force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> zone.|$|E
25|$|Cetaceans, such as {{humpback}} {{whales and}} some species of dolphins are frequent {{visitors to the}} area. Dugongs and sea turtles {{can also be found}} in surrounding waters.

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of land-based facilities {{arises from the}} turbulent wave action <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> zone. OTEC discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas. Also, the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater {{may need to be}} carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released, requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew and}} {{passengers}} took refuge in the rigging, but {{one by one the}} masts broke and went over the side and the men were hurled into the breakers. There was little opportunity for her crew to save themselves. The ship had struck well off shore and only four men reached it - a passenger, two able seamen and an apprentice. None of the survivors remembered how they actually got ashore; they heard the crash of the masts, and then felt the wreckage bumping them about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf.</b>|$|E
25|$|Different onshore and {{off shore}} wind {{patterns}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> zone create {{different types of}} waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and {{are more suitable for}} experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.|$|E

25|$|Once a float {{lands on}} a beach, it may roll <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf</b> and become etched by sand. Many glass floats show {{distinctive}} wear patterns from the corrosive forces of sand, sun, and salt water. When old netting breaks {{off of a}} float, its pattern often remains {{on the surface of}} the glass where the glass was protected under the netting. Other floats have small amounts of water trapped inside of them. This water apparently enters the floats through microscopic imperfections in the glass while the floats are suspended in Arctic ice or held under water by netting.|$|E
25|$|Townsfolk from Aldeburgh {{reached the}} ship by mid-morning to {{discover}} the ship firmly beached with the stern still partly submerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surf.</b> The crew were alive, other than ship's surgeon, Mr Thompson, who jumped overboard when the rescue party arrived and was drowned in the waves by the stern. It appeared {{that the vast majority}} of those on board were drunk and made no effort to escape the vessel despite ready access to the shore. By 9am the tide had risen through the ship and drowned all but two on board. The survivors, a seaman and a female servant of Lieutenant Key's wife, were brought away in safety.|$|E
25|$|Since 1964 Sports Illustrated publishes {{an annual}} {{swimsuit}} issue featuring bikini-clad fashion models {{on the cover}} and a pictorial section. The issues has become a cultural icon.

500|$|Damages to {{boats were}} severe; {{hundreds}} of small boats were destroyed, while many larger boats were damaged. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> lobster industry suffered heavy losses from <b>the</b> system. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> heavy <b>surf</b> that caused those damages to boats, three people were rescued in two different accidents, but they sustained injuries. Also, several small structures in Mount Desert Island, Maine were swept away by <b>the</b> high waves. <b>In</b> {{other areas of the}} New England coast, tides were [...] above average; a person was swept away and drowned, and minor tidal flooding occurred in coastal areas.
