500|$|From the beginning, Crane {{wished to}} show {{how it felt to}} be in a war by writing [...] "a {{psychological}} portrayal of fear."

[...] He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. [...] Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or <b>interlining</b> a word.

The melody is heard over the <b>interlining</b> synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang {{about a guy who}} is [...] "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track [...] "Something to Remember" [...] deals with her failed marriage to Penn and was the source of inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.|$|E
