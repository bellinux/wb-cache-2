50|$|Vintage: the Story of Wine, by Hugh Johnson, {{presents}} several {{methods that}} have been used throughout history to sweeten wine. The most common way was to harvest the grapes as late as possible. This method was advocated by Virgil and Martial in Roman times. In contrast, the ancient Greeks would harvest the <b>grapes</b> early, to <b>preserve</b> some of their acidity, and then leave them in the sun for a few days to allow them to shrivel and concentrate the sugar. In Crete, a similar effect was achieved by twisting the stalks of the grape to deprive them of sap and letting them dry on the vine—a method that produced passum and the modern Italian equivalent, passito.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} focused on the {{viticulture}} of the island of Lampedusa, located in the strait of Sicily 113 km from the African coast and 205 km from the Sicilian coasts. It is a study that has no previous recorded documentations. The research was conducted on the island to a various number of vineyard farmers in order to describe cultivation techniques and the grape germplasm utilized. Viticulture is present on several tens of hectares but in recent years is vanishing quickly and currently survives thanks to a small number of old farmers who still practice agriculture. Moreover, the strong competition for land use strongly linked to tourism, makes the survival of farming in general even more precarious. Ungrafted vines were cultivated in a difficult environment because of severe drought and within valleys that typically characterize the island and plants are usually protected by stone walls that divide the parcels. The product was typically grown for wine but also for the production of fresh and sun-dried <b>grape</b> or <b>preserved</b> in alcohol. The trades made by the inhabitants of Lampedusa, who were fishermen and farmers, with other Mediterranean areas such as Tunisia, Malta, and Southern Italy promoted the introduction of new grape germplasm. In fact, several cultivar names of grape lead us to suspect that grape germplasm might be introduced in Lampedusa from Italy and Tunisia. Because of the small size of farmland and their fragmentation, agriculture can not be supported by the European Community. However, special systems of assistance should be considered {{in order to maintain the}} conservation of viticulture in the island...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances {{have had a}} major impact on the management of traditional wineries, giving rise to the prospect of computerised decision support with respect to a range of complex harvesting and wine making decisions which have to be taken routinely. In this paper, two nested scheduling problems are considered. The first, referred to as the active cellar scheduling problem, is concerned with making good scheduling decisions within a winery (i. e. optimal assignments of grape intake batches to different processor sets inside the active part of the cellar). The harvest scheduling problem, on the other hand, refers to the larger, over-arching problem of selecting the best possible dates on which to harvest the respective vineyard blocks in order to <b>preserve</b> <b>grape</b> quality. A nested tabu search approach is presented to solve these two scheduling problems simultaneously. This solution approach has been implemented as a computerised decision support tool, called VinDSS, and the practical workability of this tool is demonstrated by means of a special case study at a winery in the South African Western Cape...|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} of red grape {{come from}} its skin. Polyfhenols {{are important for}} the physiology of grapes since they contribute to the resistance of insects and microorganisms and help to <b>preserve</b> <b>grapes</b> integrity due to their continue exposure to environment stresses including ultraviolet radiation and relatively high temperatures. Polyphenols are much related to the organoleptic properties of table grapes. In general, the techniques used to determine these compounds are usually destructive being the more commonly used the refractometer and colorimetry {{or the use of}} high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a non-destructive method able to determine polyphenolic compounds. In this research, NIR spectroscopy was used to measure the polyphenol content in table grape of ‘Crimson’ variety produced in ‘Herdade Vale da Rosa’ from the Ferreira do Alentejo area located at the south of Portugal. These table grapes were harvested in September 2010 using HPLC as a reference method. In addition, their Brix content, colour and pulp and skin weight was determined. The data obtained was analysed with Unscrambled software in order to find a model capable of predicting the content of polyphenols, Brix, colour and skin.

The finding of well <b>preserved</b> <b>grape</b> seeds is peculiar and their study opens the opportunity to improve the actual knowledge about evolution, cultivation, use and trade of Vitis L. in the Mediterranean area. This preliminary work focuses on morphologic and morphometric analysis of the ancient grape seeds with two aims: i) systematically describe the remains collection and, ii) define seeds typology and a consequent morphotaxonomic attribution. Over 200 seeds have been carefully dry cleaned (soft brush), photographed and analyzed for total breadth (B), total length (L) and length of stalk (LS) parameters, the most efficient for typological attribution (1, 2); Stummer index has been also calculated (1). Apical notch length (AN) has been for the first time evaluated.

40|$|As {{occurred}} on many other little Mediterranean islands, agricultural activity at Lampedusa (Strait of Sicily) underwent {{a very strong}} decline in terms of surface area {{during the second half}} of the last century. In particular, cereal crops have ceased and horticulture is disappearing, while vineyards still occupy a reduced area but are quickly vanishing and currently survive thanks to a small number of old farmers. Here are presented the results of a research carried out by interviewing seven farmers in order to study not only the techniques and the germplasm used in local viticulture, but also the final use of grapes and an evaluation on the connection between traditional farming and agro-ecosystems plant species-richness. Vines were grown for wine, to produce fresh and sun-dried <b>grapes,</b> or to <b>preserve</b> them in alcohol. Several names of the local varieties suggest that they might have been introduced in Lampedusa from the neighbouring territories: being fishermen and farmers at the same time, local people had trade relationships with other Mediterranean areas such as Tunisia, Malta and Southern Italy. Furthermore, local farming plays a key role in plant conservation. In fact, the disappearance of agricultural systems is leading to the extinction of 43 plant species, some of them considered rare not only on the local level, but also on the regional and national one. Because of the small size of farmland and its fragmentation, local agriculture cannot be supported by the European Community. Therefore, in order to safeguard local viticulture, special systems of assistance and new managing policies - focused on rural development plans and showing which concrete actions are necessary and feasible to protect the agroecosystems - are needed...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the wine sector has been {{characterized}} by an increased focus on the diversification of wine products. 				This change has been welcomed by consumers. In fact, today's consumers are willing to experiment with new products and unusual combinationswhich has stimulated research aimed at the discovery of native grape varieties suitable for for winemaking. In this context, particular attention are receiving vines {{for the production of}} dessert wines. Many regions have made efforts in the search for varieties and techniques able to better promote the drying process. At CREA-VE Turi-BA, there is an ongoing recovery and exploitation of indigenous grape varieties in the regions of Southern Italy and today more than 3, 000 accessions of wine <b>grapes</b> are <b>preserved.</b> 				In the present work we have investigate the possibility of the use of certain accessions of Vitis vinifera varieties (collection CREA-VE Turi-BA) deemed attractive for the production of dessert wines. Accessions presenting a good sugar content and a good titratable acidity were selected; namely, Greco bianco b. (named Q 19) and Mantonico bianco b. (named R 8) were compared to the cv of Malvasia di Lipari b. Ampelographic and ampelometric analyses, followed by molecular analysis, were carried out for varietal assessment. 				A rate of the grapes were fermented immediately after harvest with standard procedure, in comparison to rates vinified after withering. The latter was made in a greenhouse type structure with parts of natural and unforced air, without any additional energy expense. At the end of the process, a loss in weight of the grapes equal to 30 – 35 % was realized. The grapes are then stemmed, crushed, pressed and fermented by selected yeast under controlled temperature. 				Upon completion of the fermentation and subsequent stabilization, the wines were analyzed for the most important enological parameters and subjected to evaluation by a panel of expert tasters. Chemical analysis of wines showed that an alcohol content ranging to 11 – 12 % volume was reached with in the standard wine-making; whilst, for the vinification of dried grapes the alcohol content was equal to 16 % vol for Mantonico bianco b. and 18 % vol. for and Greco bianco. 				Organoleptic analysis of the wines showed a greater appreciation for both of dessert wines. The best ratings were given for the olfactory characteristics (floral and fruity aromas) and taste characteristics. In particular, the Greco bianco b. had excellent scores slightly lower than Malvasia di Lipari b. 				Therefore, the tested varieties have shown a good potential for the production of dessert wines related to typicality of the grape and the region. Dessert wines produced, have a complex flavor profile and interesting for the high acidic component, which improved the taste perception of wine and attenuated the sensation of sweetness. That feature could allow a good wine aging, too...|$|R
