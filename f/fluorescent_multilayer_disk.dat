50|$|Digital <b>Multilayer</b> <b>Disk</b> (DMD) is {{an optical}} disc format {{developed}} by D Data Inc. It {{is based on}} the 3D optical data storage technology developed for the <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Multilayer</b> Disc by the defunct company Constellation 3D. DMDs can store between 22 and 32 GB of binary information. It is based on red laser technology, so DM discs and players can be easily made in existing production facilities with little modifications. Discs are composed of multiple data layers joined by a fluorescent material. Unlike DVDs and CDs, DMD do not have metallic layers, so they are nearly transparent. DMDs are coated with proprietary chemical compositions, and those chemicals react when the red laser shines on a particular layer. The chemical reaction then generates a signal, which is then read by the disc reader. This allows for discs to potentially have up to 100 GB of storage space.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Heat {{transfer}} and lubricant depletion in a HAMR system with <b>multilayer</b> <b>disk</b> substrate are numerically simulated in this study. Cases under {{two types of}} <b>multilayer</b> <b>disk</b> substrates with different materials on the top layer as well as different laser powers are examined. The results show the significant effects of the material property and the laser power. Compared with pure glass disk substrate, larger thermal conductivity of top-layer material in the <b>multilayer</b> <b>disk</b> substrate causes faster heat conduction and thus substantial reductions in the temperature increase and lubricant depletion on the top surface. Hence it is necessary and important to incorporate the real multilayer structure in modeling heat {{transfer and}} lubricant depletion in practical HAMR systems...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Multilayer</b> Disc (FMD) is {{an optical}} disc format {{developed}} by Constellation 3D that uses fluorescent, rather than reflective materials to store data. Reflective disc formats (such as Compact Disc and DVD) have a practical limitation {{of about two}} layers, primarily due to interference, scatter, and inter-layer cross talk. However, the use of fluorescence allowed FMDs to operate according {{to the principles of}} 3D optical data storage and have up to 100 data layers. These extra layers potentially allowed FMDs to have capacities of up to a terabyte, while maintaining the same physical size of traditional optical discs.|$|R
40|$|Tailoring the {{properties}} of magnetic vortices through the preparation of structured multilayers is discussed. The dependence of the vortex core radius r on the effective anisotropy is derived within a simple model, which agrees with our simulations. As the perpendicular anisotropy increases, r also increases until a perpendicular magnetization appears in the <b>disk</b> rim. Co/Pt <b>multilayer</b> <b>disks</b> were studied; x-ray microscopy conﬁrms qualitatively the predicted behavior. This is a favorable system for implementing vortex-based spin-transfer nano-oscillator devices, with enhanced rf power resulting both from {{the increase in the}} core size and synchronization afforded by the coupling of the Co layers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiaxial flexure {{tests have}} been used {{extensively}} for the strength measurements of monolithic brittle materials. However, despite the increasing applications of multilayered structures, characterization of their strengths using biaxial flexure tests is unavailable. This is because the analytical description {{of the relation between}} the strength and the fracture load for multilayers subjected to biaxial flexure tests is nonexistent. To characterize the biaxial strength of multilayers, an analytical model is developed in the present study to derive the general closed-form solutions for the elastic stress distributions in thin <b>multilayered</b> <b>disks</b> subjected to biaxial flexure tests. To verify the analytical solutions, finite element analyses are performed on trilayered disks subjected to ring-on-ring tests. Good agreement is obtained between analytical and numerical results. The present closed-form solutions hence provide a basis for evaluating the biaxial strength of multilayered systems. Depending upon the strength of the individual layers and the stress distribution through the thickness of the multilayer during testing, cracking can initiate from any layer under tension...|$|R

40|$|The {{competition}} between two regimes of the nucleation of superconductivity is investigated experimentally and theoretically in a mesoscopic disk-shaped superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid. By changing the magnetic state of a <b>multilayered</b> Co/Pt <b>disk</b> one can reversibly affect the magnetic-field {{dependence of the}} critical temperature T(c) (H) of an Al layer. We demonstrate that an enhancement of the magnetic field {{near the edge of}} the out-of-plane magnetized disk either stimulates the nucleation of superconductivity at the disk perimeter due to the field compensation effect or prevents it due to edge magnetic barrier (for relatively low parallel to H parallel to values). As a consequence, the presence of such magnetic-field pattern makes it possible to eliminate boundary effects for mesoscopic superconducting samples. Switching from one nucleation regime to another while sweeping H leads to an abrupt change of the slope of the T(c) (H) envelope. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} measurement of optical phase {{in the media and}} systems of optical data storage, polarization dependence of signals from periodic one-dimensional arrays of magnetic domains in magneto-optical media and crystalline domains in amorphous phase-change media, and optical characterization of multilayer stacks used as optical data storage media. Digital signals in optical data storage systems can be encoded in the intensity, polarization or phase of the carrier beam. Both surface structure and material property variations can create a phase modulation at the exit pupil. Current optical data storage systems do not make use of this phase modulation and its recovery could increase the strength of the generated signal. We experimentally describe a variant of Zernike's phase-contrast microscope to measure the small phase object, an interferometer to measure the relative optical phase on reflection between amorphous and crystalline regions of the phase-change media of optical data storage, and a method to measure optical phase information in disk system. In order to increase the data density in optical data storage, the wavelength becomes shorter and the numerical aperture of the objective lens becomes higher. In the interaction of the focused beam with a grooved, <b>multilayer</b> <b>disk,</b> the different response to s- and p-polarized light upon reflection from the disk results in different complex-amplitudes and has strong impact on readout and servo signals for the two fundamental components of polarization. Polarization dependence of signals from periodic one-dimensional arrays of magnetic domains in magneto-optical (MO) media and crystalline domains in amorphous phase change (PC) media are studied by theoretical calculation and experiment. Currently, many different multilayer stacks are designed to enhance the contrast of readout signal, reduce noise, increase the storage density and speed, or improve media reliability. A good understanding of the range of values of the optical constants should help to improve the accuracy of optical and thermal design of the storage media. The refractive index n and the absorption coefficient k of these materials vary to some extent with the film thickness and with the film deposition environment. We report the observed variations of optical constants among samples of differing structure and among samples fabricated in different laboratories...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this dissertation is to present a clear physical picture and useful insights of polarization effects in the diffraction of focused beams by grooved, multilayer-coated disks. The reading process of optical disk systems significantly relies on {{the reaction of the}} incident focused beam to the disk structure, may it be the groove profile or coating materials. The resulting complex-amplitude from diffraction is the main source for the readout signal. In the presence of the periodic pattern and the focused beam, however, different polarization states usually result in different complex-amplitudes. A good understanding of polarization effects in grooved <b>multilayer</b> <b>disks</b> is thus required for the optimum design of optical data storage systems. The pursuit of high-density recording inevitably drives the optical data storage industry to reduce the wavelength of light sources, decrease the track pitch of optical disks, and increase the numerical aperture of objective lenses. The track pitch {{and the size of the}} focused spot gradually approach the optical wavelength. Under these circumstances, the analysis of the interaction of focused beams with this type of high-frequency periodic disk using conventional scalar diffraction theory is no longer adequate. Only through vector diffraction study of polarization effects in the interaction of the focused beam with the periodic pattern can the characteristics of an optical disk system be fully understood and improved. Starting from the introduction of various polarization effects in optical disk systems and basic concepts of both scalar and vector diffraction theory, we then focus on the studies of diffraction patterns at the exit pupil of the objective lens and on the disk surface. Different behavior on the baseball pattern and in the effective groove depth is observed for the two polarization states. The use of the solid immersion lens to extensively increase the area density of optical disk systems prompts us to investigate the influence of evanescent-wave coupling on the near-field optical disk system. Finally, we study the feasibility of using a novel differential polarization microscope to reduce polarization effects and to increase the image contrast of magnetic domains on magneto-optical disks...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{assisted}} recording is {{a promising}} technique to further increase the storage density in hard <b>disks.</b> <b>Multilayer</b> recording grains with graded Curie temperature is discussed to further assist the write process. Describing the correct magnetization dynamics of these grains, from room temperature to {{far above the}} Curie point, during a write process {{is required for the}} calculation of bit error rates. We present a coarse grained approach based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation to model exchange coupled grains with low computational effort. The required temperature dependent material properties such as the zero-field equilibrium magnetization as well as the parallel and normal susceptibilities are obtained by atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations. Each grain is described with one magnetization vector. In order to mimic the atomistic exchange interaction between the grains a special treatment of the exchange field in the coarse grained approach is presented...|$|R
30|$|There is a {{drive to}} replace {{conventional}} light sources with white-emitting sources based on light emitting devices (LEDs) on grounds of cost effectiveness and low power consumption. This route to white light emission involves various methodologies, for example, mixing the three primary colours (red, green and blue), the use of <b>multilayer</b> <b>fluorescent</b> structures or coating a yellow (partially transparent) fluorophore on to a blue-LED. This last approach is commonly employed where the LED is a blue-emitting GaN or InGaN device and the fluorophore is Ce:YAG. The coating {{is often referred to}} as a phosphor, although in fact the process is one of fluorescence; this is in contrast to ‘fluorescent’ lights where the coating is actually a phosphor or a mixture of several different phosphors comprised of transition metal or rare earth compounds. In addition to the spectral composition of the emitted light the other factor that needs to be considered in non-thermal light sources is that of efficiency; indeed, the efficiency is the main driving factor behind their development. This is often expressed in terms of lumens per Watt which is termed the efficacy of the source. In fact, this measure links spectrum and efficiency since the lumen is a measure that takes into account the spectral response of the human eye. Currently, in the UK, commercially available LED sources for domestic use are in the range of 55 to 70 lumens/W which contrasts with approximately 15 lumens/W for a tungsten-halogen bulb operating at approximately 3000 K.|$|R
