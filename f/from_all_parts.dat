Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>parts,</b> it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E

5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1805 by Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza carbonaria.

In 1889, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus Geopyxis, giving the species its current name. Pustularia carbonaria, published by Heinrich Rehm in 1884, is a synonym of G.carbonaria. Louis-Joseph Grélet proposed the variety Geopyxis carbonaria var. sessilis in 1937, referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk, but the taxon {{is not considered}} to have independent taxonomic significance. In 1860 Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Peziza lepida from collections made in Japan {{as part of the}} North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853–1856). This taxon was synonymized with G.carbonaria by Mien Rifai in 1968, a taxonomic opinion corroborated by Donald Pfister about a decade later.|$|E
