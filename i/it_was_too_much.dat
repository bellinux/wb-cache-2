5|$|Amy Dumas {{was born}} in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 14, 1975. She {{attended}} many different schools throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School six months before graduation. She majored in education at Georgia State University, but dropped out in 1993 because she felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like high school.|$|E
5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the lower Danube. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad disciplined bowling yielded four early wickets putting Sri Lanka on 38/4 after 14.1 overs. Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan {{started a}} {{recovery}} but after both their wickets fell within nine deliveries {{of each other}} the game was largely in England’s control. From then on wickets fell at regular intervals and although Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof added 43 runs for the final wicket <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{to ask for the}} final pair to win the match.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. Don't say that, Monsieur! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{the echo}} of my heart.|$|R

25|$|In November 1994, Minty began a two-week-long show at London's Freedom Cafe, {{including}} {{audience member}} Alexander McQueen, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Westminster City Council, who closed the show down after only one night. This {{was to be}} Bowery's last performance. The show was documented by photographer A.M. Hanson with imagery subsequently published in books about Bowery and McQueen. Minty was a financial loss and represented a low point in Bowery's colourful career. A spin-off band called The Offset later formed including artist Donald Urquhart.|$|E
25|$|Solid {{contributions}} {{throughout the}} order (six men passed 20; Mortensen an unbeaten 55) guided Denmark to a good-looking 265/8 against Malaysia, despite Stevens' haul of 4-48, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for their opponents, {{who lost their}} first three wickets for 18 and were eventually dismissed off the penultimate ball for 178, 87 runs behind, despite V Vijiyalingam's 51, his only Trophy half-century. Anil Patel made 65 out of Kenya's 209/9 against local rivals East Africa, who had no chance once they had slumped to 33/5 and lost in the end by 63 runs.|$|E
25|$|The earlier {{class of}} franklins (freemen or French or Norman freeholders) {{were similar to}} yeomen: wealthy peasant landowners, freeholders or village officials. They were {{typically}} village leaders (aldermen), constables or mayors. Franklin militias were similar to later yeomanries. Yeomen took over those roles in the 14th century {{as many of them}} became leaders, constables, sheriffs, justices of the peace, mayors and significant leaders of their country districts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> for even ‘valets’ known as ‘yeoman archers’ were forbidden to be returned to parliament, indicating they even held power at a level never before held by the upper class of commoners. In districts remoter from landed gentry and burgesses, yeomen held more official power: this is attested in statutes of the reign of Henry VIII indicating yeomen along with knights and squires as leaders for certain purposes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'God forbid!' was the reply. 'And yet {{the name}} is a strange one; <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to fancy two. Tell me, landlord, is he old?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> 'Happy endings' don't come off. The {{happiness}} {{lies in the}} struggle, you know,--an old saying, {{but quite}} true. Afterwards something intervenes." ...|$|R

25|$|By 16:15 {{fighting}} {{had been}} going on for two and three quarter hours when a squadron of the Wellington Regiment carried out a bayonet charge against a close Ottoman position. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the Ottoman units whose fighting strength gave way. They fell back beyond Ayun Kara pursued by rifle and machine-gun fire as neither regiment was in a fit state to follow. The Ottoman 3rd Division left behind some 400 dead in front of the Auckland's position alone; although others have quoted totals of between 150 and 162 Ottoman dead. The New Zealanders captured great numbers of machine-guns (some with prismatic sights) including two Lewis guns. Their casualties numbered 175; three officers and twenty-nine other ranks killed, eleven officers and 132 other ranks wounded with the Auckland Regiment suffering eighty-nine of those casualties.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{started a}} key {{series against the}} San Francisco Giants at AT Park, hoping to make up ground in the standings. However, they dropped the opener of the series 5–2. They evened the series the next day as Adrian Gonzalez tripled {{in the eighth inning}} and scored on a double by Hanley Ramírez for the key run in a 3–2 victory. However, the team fell 5 games behind the Giants when Barry Zito shut them out the next day, 4–0. On September 11, Kershaw only allowed three hits and one unearned run against the Arizona Diamondbacks but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> as Ian Kennedy blanked the Dodgers 1–0. The Dodgers {{actually}} scored first the next night, Adrian Gonzalez double scored two runs to give the Dodgers an early lead... but Trevor Cahill shut them down the rest of the game and the Diamondbacks came back to win 3–2.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Thank you, I'm used to them. Would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{to ask you}} to wait {{five minutes}} while I get rid of my {{landlord}} downstairs? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you forget?' said Philip. 'I {{would not}} {{advise you to}} make much of this talent in public; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> a badge of his descent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, sir, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> honour,' cried Dame Hobson, with a simper. 'I shall go {{down into}} the cellars and bring a flask of the best.' ...|$|R
25|$|Warwickshire {{were set}} to chase 291 to win, and Carter {{fulfilled}} {{his job as a}} pinch hitter well, scoring four fours and one six en route to 32, and Nick Knight and Ian Bell kept up with the required run rate well. However, Bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50, and that limited his movements - he succumbed shortly afterwards, chipping a simple catch to Chris Tremlett and was gone for 54. The other batsmen tried to add runs with Knight, but yielded to the Hampshire bowling and fielding effort, and when Knight was finally dismissed for 118 Warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets. Shane Watson effectively stopped that, having Dougie Brown and Ashley Giles out bowled, leaving Warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Makhaya Ntini, who was bowled by Chris Tremlett with the second ball of the last over, and thus Hampshire took an 18-run victory.|$|E
25|$|The Conseil d'État and Palais de la Légion d'Honneur (Hôtel de Salm) were rebuilt {{in their}} {{original}} style. The new Hôtel de Ville {{was built on the}} lines of a more picturesque Neo-Renaissance style than the original that was based on the appearance of the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, with a façade decorated with statues of outstanding personages who contributed to the history and fame of Paris. The destroyed Ministry of Finance on the Rue de Rivoli was replaced by a grand hotel, while the Ministry moved into the Richelieu wing of the Louvre, where it remained until 1989. The ruined Cour des Comptes on the Left Bank was replaced by the Gare d'Orléans, also known under the name Gare d'Orsay, now the Museé d'Orsay. The one difficult decision was the Tuileries Palace, originally built in the 16th century by Marie de' Medici as a royal residence. The interior had been entirely destroyed by fire, but the walls were still largely intact. The walls remained standing for ten years while the fate of the ruins was debated. Baron Haussmann, in retirement, appealed for a restoration of the building as a historic monument, and there was a proposal {{to turn it into a}} new museum of modern art. In 1881, however, a new Chamber of Deputies more sympathetic to the Commune than previous governments decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> a symbol of the monarchy and had the walls pulled down.|$|E
500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> hassle... It was another creative limitation... If I were in my studio, I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having {{the ability to do}} that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Julius! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> You <b>are</b> sure I am awake? This {{is not the}} old dream!" [...] {{cried the}} exile, {{grasping}} his cousin's arm quite gainfully.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{that every one}} is so kind. Oh! <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much!</b> <b>it</b> overflows!' Violet leant against her husband, {{shedding}} tears of happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> right in you,' said Guy, grudgingly. 'However, I must not complain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{that you should}} not reject me altogether.' ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the initial}} {{storyboard}} pitch to Frederator Studios, Ward brought a guitar {{and played the}} episode's theme song. Frederator's CEO Fred Seibert was initially disinclined to make the short, feeling <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a [...] "student film" [...] and without much commercial appeal. Longtime colleagues, development executive Homan and production executive Kevin Kolde, convinced him otherwise, arguing that Seibert had actually laughed in the presentation, something {{that he did not}} often do. Frederator approved the pitch, and [...] "Adventure Time" [...] soon went into production.|$|E
500|$|In other words, Bellman was a [...] "tavern rhymester", admittedly with a {{wonderful}} gift of improvisation, who wildly ignored the rules of literary genres. For example, within the classical tradition odes and satires {{were supposed to have}} different metres and different use of language. Kellgren did not mind the amoral attitude: [...] "indeed he shared it". But an Epistle like No. 28 traversed all moods, [...] "from lyrical to humorous, tragic, descriptive and dramatic." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for critics such as Kellgren.|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't {{want to put it}} out because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of an English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid!" [...] was the reply. [...] "And yet {{the name}} is a strange one; <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to fancy two. Tell me, landlord, is he old?" ...|$|R
60|$|Muf. Thou say'st true, a very {{considerable}} sum: {{he shall}} not die, {{though he had}} committed folly with a slave; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to lose by him.|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to {{say that}} the world changed from the moment the Comet's wheels left the ground." [...] Tony Fairbrother, manager, {{upgraded}} Comet development.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "gay steel mill" [...] {{scene was}} written by Steve Tompkins. He first pitched that Homer and Bart would {{encounter}} longshoremen, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> work to animate the lading of ships, so a steel mill was used instead. Tompkins also wrote a different third act for the episode, which was never produced. Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney, and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at [...] "Santa's Village" [...] they {{would go back to}} the steel mill. There, Homer would attempt to prove his heterosexuality by having a human tractor pulling contest with some of the steel mill workers. It was decided that it [...] "didn't really service the story" [...] and was dropped.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tender throat, I believe; Violet {{always was}} anxious. I wish I {{had not come}} away; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her alone! Ha! what are we {{stopping}} for now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{looked hard}} at him--but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already almost dark. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we're rather old friends. Would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> if I asked you why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} have the band stop that piece, Mr. Tyers," [...] cried Lady Sarah. [...] "I declare, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for my nerves. Let them play Dibbin's Ephesian Matron." ...|$|R
