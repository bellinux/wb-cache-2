Well, that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E

Paley– but extremely popular with viewers. While Aubrey had a great feel for what would be successful with viewers, he had nothing but contempt for them. [...] "The American public <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> fly over," [...] he said. [...] His former boss at ABC, Oliver E.

500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody knew me, when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E

In describing [...] "Exit", Bono said [...] "It is all very well to address America and the violence that is an aggressive foreign policy but to really understand {{that you have to}} get under the skin of your own darkness, the violence we all contain within us. Violence <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> have quite a bit about. I have a side of me which, in a corner, can be very violent.

500|$|However, in 1993, Jackson told Oprah Winfrey [...] "there, as I know of, {{there is}} no such thing as skin bleaching. [...] I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." [...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E
500|$|Vachss said [...] "writing is {{my way of}} preaching. For me, it's always, {{always the}} message. The plot <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> {{contrive}} to deliver the message. You've got to have enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, but if you can give them an exciting story, you can always make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995.

It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I also think it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> had been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E

500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've been doing the same thing for 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future". He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> never had in my wildest dreams ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week. His exposure on social networks jumped 3,391% between the weeks of July 7–13 and July 14–20, giving him more exposures than Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{said she}} took a moment before agreeing, as she had just wrapped up work on Gaga's Monster Ball HBO special {{but she could not}} resist in the end. [...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E! News at 7 pm.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud."
