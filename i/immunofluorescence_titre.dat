Nine of 31 patients (29 %) with Bell's palsy and eight of 12 patients (75 %) with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome had anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> antibody <b>titres</b> of {{greater than or equal}} to 1 / 10. On the other hand, none of 14 patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and 51 healthy adults showed anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> antibody <b>titres</b> of {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 10. The anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> antibody <b>titre</b> in two patients with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome increased later and decreased sooner than the indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> antibody <b>titre,</b> becoming undetectable at 66 and 104 days, respectively, after onset of the disease. There was no cross reaction between anti-VZV and anti-HSV antibodies in the patients who showed a positive antibody rise for VZV. As the acute stage of VZV infection is obscure in the patients with peripheral facial palsy without herpes the screening of anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody to VZV at titres greater than or equal to 1 / 10 may be useful for the diagnosis of VZV infection in patients with peripheral facial palsy...|$|R

40|$|Scrub typhus is {{a common}} cause of undiagnosed febrile illness in certain {{tropical}} regions, but can be easily treated with antibiotics. The causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, is antigenically variable which complicates diagnosis and efforts towards vaccine development. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study aimed to dissect the antigenic and genetic relatedness of O. tsutsugamushi strains and investigate sero-diagnostic reactivities by titrating individual patient sera against their O. tsutsugamushi isolates (whole-cell antigen preparation), in homologous and heterologous serum-isolate pairs from the same endemic region in NE Thailand. The indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to titrate Orientia tsutsugamushi isolates and human sera, and a mathematical technique, antigenic cartography, was applied to these data to visualise the antigenic differences and cross-reactivity between strains and sera. No functional or antigen-specific analyses were performed. The antigenic variation found in clinical isolates was much less pronounced than the genetic differences found in the 56 kDa type-specific antigen genes. The Karp-like sera were more broadly reactive than the Gilliam-like sera. Conclusions/Significance: Antigenic cartography worked well with scrub typhus indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>titres.</b> The data from humoral responses suggest that a Karp-like strain would provide broader antibody cross-reactivity than a Gilliam-like strain. Although previous exposure to O. tsutsugamushi could not be ruled out, scrub typhus patient serum antibody responses were characterised by strong homologous, but weak heterologous antibody titres, with little evidence for cross-reactivity by Gilliam-like sera, but a broader response from some Karp-like sera.

40|$|Seventy seven sera with antimitochondrial {{antibody}} exhibiting the M 2 -M 4 {{pattern in}} immunofluorescence (56 from primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 21 from non-primary biliary cirrhosis patients) were studied by the combined use of Western immunoblotting with beef heart mitochondria and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with beef heart submitochondrial particles. Forty seven sera (10 without autoantibodies and 37 with different auto-antibodies) were included as controls. By immunoblotting, seven mitochondrial peptides reacting with antimitochondrial antibody positive sera were detected. These were of molecular weight 74 kD, 58 kD, 55 kD, 52 kD, 51 kD, 46 kD, and 43 kD. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera and 71 % of antimitochondrial antibody-positive non-primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted {{with one or}} more of these peptides, while none of the 47 antimitochondrial antibody negative sera reacted in immunoblotting. The 74 kD band was the most frequently detected (84 % of primary biliary cirrhosis and 57 % of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the primary biliary cirrhosis sera which failed to react with this peptide, showed a positive reaction with that of molecular weight 52 kD. 67 / 77 (87 %) immunofluorescence antimitochondrial antibody positive sera reacted in the ELISA test (93 % of primary biliary cirrhosis and 71 % of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the 47 immunofluorescence antimitochondrial antibody negative sera were confirmed negative by ELISA. The ELISA values correlated with the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>titres</b> (p less than 0. 05). By comparison of the results obtained by these two techniques, it emerged that the ELISA test (using our preparation of submitochondrial particles) was not able to detect the antibody directed against the mitochondrial peptide of 52 kD, which thus seems to be different from the other specificities...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data suggest}} {{a role for}} the {{microflora}} in the disease expression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In active SLE anti-ds-DNA antibodies {{are supposed to be}} pathogenic by forming immune complexes with DNA. Bacteria might induce the production of anti-ds-DNA antibodies. To explore the relation between the host and his microflora in SLE in comparison with healthy controls we studied the prevalence of systemic antibodies to faecal bacteria that were discriminated by their morphology by indirect <b>immunofluorescence.</b> IgM <b>titres</b> against their own faecal microflora were found to be lower both in active and inactive SLE when compared to healthy individuals. IgG-class antibacterial antibodies were increased in inactive SLE but decreased in active SLE compared to inactive SLE and healthy controls, although plasma levels of total IgG were almost doubled in active SLE. The lower IgG antibacterial antibody titres in active SLE might possibly result from sequestration of these IgG antibodies in immune complexes, indicating a possible role for antibacterial antibodies in exacerbations of SLE...|$|R
40|$|Objective. We {{performed}} a retrospective evaluation of whether c-ANCA <b>titres</b> (indirect <b>immunofluorescence)</b> and antiproteinase 3 (PR 3) -ANCA levels (ELISA) at diagnosis and following immunosuppressive treatment are predictive of relapse of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Methods. Patients diagnosed with PR 3 -ANCA-associated vasculitis between 1991 and 2002, {{with at least}} 2 yr of follow-up, and treated with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids only (1991 - 1996) or switched to azathioprine after induction of remission with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids (1997 - 2002) were included. ANCA were assessed by immunofluorescence and direct PR 3 -specific ELISA at diagnosis and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after diagnosis. Actuarial relapse-free survival was analysed with the log rank test. Results. We studied 87 patients positive for PR 3 -ANCA: 46 were on cyclophosphamide maintenance therapy and 41 switched to azathioprine. Overall actuarial relapse-free survival was 72 % at 2 yr and 34 % at 5 yr. Relapse-free survival did not differ between patients on cyclophosphamide maintenance and patients switched to azathioprine maintenance (P = 0. 34). Patients who became and stayed negative for c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) or PR 3 -ANCA (ELISA) until 24 months after diagnosis had a lower risk of relapse (P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 02, respectively). Positive c-ANCA (<b>immunofluorescence)</b> <b>titres</b> at 3 [relative risk (RR) 2. 0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 - 3. 8], 12 (RR 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 3), 18 (RR 2. 9; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 4. 6) and 24 months (RR 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 5. 0) {{were significantly associated with}} relapse within 5 yr after diagnosis. PR 3 -ANCA levels > 10 U/ml at 18 (RR 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 3) and 24 months (RR 4. 6; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 6. 3) were predictive of relapse within 5 yr. In the azathioprine group, a positive c-ANCA titre at the time of switching to azathioprine (RR 2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 4) was associated with relapse. Conclusion. Positive c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) and PR 3 -ANCA (ELISA) titres during early follow-up identify patients at increased risk of relapse...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} delta virus {{infection is}} associated with the presence of autoantibodies to rat forestomach and thymus in approximately 60 % of patients' sera. We have characterized the antigen against which these autoantibodies are directed as a protein of 46 kD by immunoblotting studies on rat forestomach and thymus extracts. Normal human sera or sera from patients with other hepatic or non-hepatic autoimmune disorders did not bind to this protein. The immunoblot assay was more sensitive than <b>immunofluorescence.</b> Maximal <b>titre</b> was 1 : 10, 000 versus 1 : 5120. By techniques of elution of specific antibodies from immunoblots, our results showed that the same antigen was present in both tissues. This antigen did not share common epitopes with {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV). Patients' sera depleted of basal cell layer and thymic stellate epithelial cell antibodies by absorption with the corresponding tissue extract maintained the HDV antibody titres. The autoimmune phenomena observed in patients with HDV infection seems to be a colateral process induced by the replication of delta virus in the host...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of perinuclear antibodies against neutrophils (pANCA) has been detected recently in sera {{of patients with}} inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In order to evaluate their clinical significance, sera from 126 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (80 Crohn's disease and 46 ulcerative colitis and 22 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were examined for pANCA by indirect immunofluorescence on liver sections and cytocentrifuge slides of neutrophils and by immunoblot. Perinuclear antibodies against neutrophils were found in 83 % of patients with ulcerative colitis in 88 % of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease, in 40 % of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis but without inflammatory bowel disease, and in 25 % of patients with Crohn's disease using the <b>immunofluorescence</b> test. <b>Titres</b> of pANCA ranged from 1 : 10 to 1 : 1000 in ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (median 1 : 100), whereas in Crohn's disease only four patients had titres of more than 1 : 10. The occurrence of pANCA did not correlate with clinical activity of Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis whereas in ulcerative colitis high titres of pANCA were found mainly in active disease. Using an immunoblot system with sonified neutrophils as antigen, 82 % of sera from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis reacted with up to five different determinants, whereas only 12 % of sera from patients with Crohn's disease and 11 % of sera with ulcerative colitis detected one of the determinants, suggesting different antigens involved in pANCA reaction...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} purify trypanosomastigotes of some strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (Y, CL, FL, F, "Berenice", "Colombiana" and "São Felipe") from mouse blood by using DEAE-cellulose columns was standardized. This {{procedure}} is {{a modification of}} the Lanham & Godfrey methods and differs in some aspects from others described to purify T. cruzi bloodstream trypomastigotes, mainly by avoidance of prior purifications of parasites. By this method, the broad trypomastigotes were mainly isolated, accounting for higher recoveries obtained with strains having higher percentages of these forms: processing of infected blood from irradiated mice could be advantageous by increasing the recovery of parasites (percentage and/or total number) and elution of more slender trypomastigotes. Trypomastigotes purified by this method presented normal morphology and motility, remained infective to triatomine bugs and mice, showing in the latter prepatent periods and courses parasitemia {{similar to those of}} control parasites, and also reproducing the polymorphism pattern of each strain. Their virulence and pathogenicity also remained considerably preserved, the latter property being evaluated by LD 50 tests, mortality rates and mean survival time of inoculated mice. Moreover, these parasites presented positive, clear and peripheral <b>immunofluorescence</b> reaction at <b>titres</b> similar to those of control organisms, thus suggesting important preservation of their surface antigens...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Antiperinuclear factor (APF), "antikeratin {{antibodies}}" ("AKA"), and {{antibodies to}} human epidermis filaggrin (AFA), are highly specific serological markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which recognise epitopes on various isoforms of (pro) filaggrin. It was proposed that these antibodies are globally named antifilaggrin autoantibodies. Here the diagnostic {{value of the}} detection of each one is compared and the overlap between the three tests evaluated.  METHODS— 492 serum samples were tested, including 279  RA serum samples, taken from patients in France and Belgium. APF and "AKA" titres were estimated by indirect <b>immunofluorescence,</b> and AFA <b>titres</b> by immunoblotting on filaggrin enriched human epidermis extracts.  RESULTS—By a convenient choice of the positivity thresholds, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the tests were shown to be similar (0. 52  and 0. 97, respectively). Although the antibody titres were strongly correlated, the associations APF-AFA or AFA-"AKA" permitted more than 52 % or 55 % of RA to be diagnosed, with a specificity of 0. 99.  CONCLUSION—APF, "AKA", and AFA detection have a similar diagnostic value. However, because the three tests do not totally overlap, associating APF with "AKA" or AFA with "AKA" can improve diagnostic sensitivity. None of the three antigens used bear all the epitopes recognised by anti-filaggrin autoantibodies.    Keywords: rheumatoid arthritis; antifilaggrin autoantibodies; antiperinuclear factor; antikeratin antibodie...|$|R

This study examined the association between Q fever serology and cardiovascular disease in a region where Q fever is endemic. A case-control study was conducted in the Hospital Universitario de Burgos (Spain) between February 2011 and June 2012. A total of 513 samples were tested, from 454 hospitalized patients ≥ 65 years old, of whom 164 were cases (patients with prevalent or incident coronary heart, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery, disease) and 290 controls (patients without cardiovascular disease). Serum IgG antibody phase II titres against Q fever were determined by <b>immunofluorescence</b> assay. Seropositivity (<b>titres</b> ≥ 1 : 256) was detected in 84 / 164 (51. 2 %) cases and in 109 / 290 (37. 6 %) controls (p = 0. 005; OR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 1 – 2. 5). This ratio increases when adjusted for sex, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, diabetes and atrial fibrillation (OR, 2. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 5 – 4. 7). The geometric mean titre (GMT) for C. burnetii phase II assay was higher in cases than in controls (p = 0. 004). We found no significant relationship between cardiovascular disease and C. pneumoniae, and Cytomegalovirus seropositivity (both determined by the IgG ELISA method).

40|$|LKM- 1 antibody, {{which characterizes}} a subtype of {{autoimmune}} hepatitis (AIH), {{is also found}} in some patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It has been suggested that HCV initiates autoimmunity through molecular mimicry, because there is partial identity between HCV and cytochrome P 4502 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6), the putative target of LKM- 1. Whether CYP 2 D 6 is the target of LKM- 1 in HCV-related liver disease, however, is controversial. To clarify this issue, we have studied by phage plaque assay and Western blot the reactivity to recombinant CYP 2 D 6, isolated from a human liver cDNA library, in 55 patients with LKM- 1, 18 (14 females, median age 12 years) anti-HCV-negative, with classical AIH, and 37 (27 females, median age 52 years) anti-HCV-positive. Reactivity to CYP 2 D 6 was found in 72 % of the anti-HCV-negative, but only in 27 % of the anti-HCV-positive patients (P < 0. 001), although <b>immunofluorescence</b> LKM- 1 <b>titres</b> were similar in the two groups. In addition, to investigate whether the antibody responsible for the LKM- 1 fluorescent pattern also reacts with CYP 2 D 6, we have determined the specificity of LKM- 1 antibodies present in the supernatant of lymphoblastoid B cell lines obtained from two patients with LKM- 1 -positive AIH. An oligo/monoclonal antibody thus generated gave both the typical fluorescent pattern and reacted with CYP 2 D 6. Our results show that whilst antibodies producing the characteristic LKM- 1 fluorescent pattern can react with CYP 2 D 6, not all LKM- 1 -positive sera do so, particularly if obtained from patients with chronic HCV infection. This suggests that LKM- 1 in HCV infection recognizes epitopes or antigens different from those targeted in AIH...|$|R
