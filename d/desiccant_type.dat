40|$|This {{paper has}} {{presented}} {{a review of}} the thermodynamics of three desiccant cooling cycles: the ventilation cycle, the recirculation cycle, and the Dunkle cycle. For the ventilation cycle the qualitative effects of changes in the effectiveness of individual components were analyzed. There are two possible paths to improved dehumidifier performance: changing the design of dehumidifiers using currently available desiccants so as to increase effectiveness without increasing parasitic losses, or developing new desiccants specifically tailored for solar cooling applications. The later part of this paper has considered the second option. A list of desirable desiccant properties was defined, properties of currently used solid and liquid desiccants were compared to this list, and a hypothetical <b>desiccant</b> <b>type</b> that would give improved system performance was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria rapid {{diagnostic}} tests (RDTs) are protected from humidity-caused degradation by a desiccant {{added to the}} device packaging. The present study assessed malaria RDT products for the availability, type and design of desiccants and their information supplied in the instructions for use (IFU). Methods Criteria were based on recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Community (CE) and own observations. Silica gel sachets were defined as self-indicating (all beads coated with a humidity indicator that changes colour upon saturation), partial-indicating (part of beads coated) and non-indicating (none of the beads coated). Indicating silica gel sachets were individually assessed for humidity saturation and (in case of partial-indicating silica gels) {{for the presence of}} indicating beads. Results Fifty malaria RDT products from 25 manufacturers were assessed, 14 (28 %) products were listed by the “Global Fund Quality Assurance Policy” and 31 (62 %) were CE-marked. All but one product contained a desiccant, mostly (47 / 50, 94 %) silica gel. Twenty (40 %) RDT products (one with no desiccant and 19 with non-indicating desiccant) did not meet the WHO guidelines recommending indicating desiccant. All RDT products with self- or partial-indicating silica gel (n[*]=[*] 22 and 8 respectively) contained the toxic cobalt dichloride as humidity indicator. Colour change indicating humidity saturation was observed for 8 / 16 RDT products, at a median incidence of 0. 8 % (range 0. 05 %- 4. 6 %) of sachets inspected. In all RDTs with partial-indicating silica gel, sachets with no colour indicating beads were found (median proportion 13. 5 % (0. 6 % - 17. 8 %) per product) and additional light was needed to assess the humidity colour. Less than half (14 / 30, 47 %) IFUs of RDT products with indicating desiccants mentioned to check the humidity saturation before using the test. Information on properties, safety hazards and disposal of the desiccant was not included in any of the IFUs. There were no differences between Global Fund-listed and CE marked RDT products compared to those which were not. Similar findings were noted for a panel of 11 HIV RDTs that was assessed with the same checklist as the malaria RDTs. Conclusion RDTs showed shortcomings in <b>desiccant</b> <b>type</b> and information supplied in the IFU. </p...|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{environmental}} concerns mandate replacement of CFC`s with alternate refrigeration fluids. Until now, relatively little testing {{had been reported}} in the literature for compatibility of desiccants in these new working fluids. Using bench scale test methods generally accepted throughout the industry today, this work provides data necessary to assess the compatibility of virtually all of the currently used <b>desiccant</b> <b>types</b> - both bead and molded core, with thirteen refrigerant/lubricant combinations. The desiccants have been tested by exposure to refrigerant and lubricant in sealed, glass tubes in accordance with ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 97 - 1989. After aging, the liquid phase was evaluated for acid anion formation, change in color, and presence of halide ions, the gas phase was analyzed for refrigerant decomposition by gas chromatography, and the desiccants were evaluated for changes in crush strength and for retention of acids and halide ions. Metal catalysts, also present in the sealed tubes, were visually examined for corrosion, copper plating, and appearance changes...|$|R
40|$|Natural gas is {{the most}} {{important}} & popular fossil fuel in the current era and future as well. Raw natural gas exists in deep underground reservoirs under certain temperature & pressure. Therefore, it may content several of non-hydrocarbon components for example, hydrogen sulphide, nitrogen and water vapour. In order to meet gas sale contract specifications, these impurities should be removed or reduced. Indeed, non- hydrocarbons components usually cause several technical problems for example, corrosion and environment pollution. Khurmala dome is located in southwest Erbil-Kurdistan region. The Kurdistan region government has paid great attention for this dome to provide the fuel for Kurdistan region. However, the Khurmala associated natural gas is currently flaring at the field. Khurmala gas could be recovered and utilized either as feedstock to power station or to sell it in global market. However, the laboratory analysis has showed that the Khurmala sour gas has huge quantities of H 2 S about (5. 3 %) and CO 2 about (4. 4 %). Indeed, Khurmala gas sweetening process has been achieved in previous study by using Aspen HYSYS. However, Khurmala sweet gas still contents some quintets of water about 23 ppm. This amount of water vapour should be removed or reduced. Indeed, water contents in natural gas cause several technical problems for example, hydrates and corrosion. Therefore, this study aims to simulate the prospective Khurmala gas dehydration process by using Aspen HYSYS program. Moreover, the simulation process succeeds in reducing the water content to less than 0. 1 ppm. In addition, the simulation work is also achieved process optimization to find out the most effective glycol type to remove the water vapour from natural gas stream by adopting several <b>desiccant</b> <b>types</b> fo...|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} a novel {{composite}} desiccant material “CaCl 2 /Vermiculite/Saw wood” have been synthesized and {{tested for the}} water generation from atmospheric air. The vermiculite- saw wood used as a host matrix and CaCl 2 as a hygroscopic salt. A solar glass <b>desiccant</b> box <b>type</b> system with a collector area of 0.36  m 2 has been used. Design parameters for water generation are height of glass from the desiccant material bed as 0.22  m, inclination in angle as 30 º, the effective thickness of glass as 3  mm and number of glazing as single. It {{has been found that}} the concentration of calcium chloride is the most influencing factor for fresh water generation from atmospheric air. The maximum amount of water produced by using novel composite desiccant material is 195  ml/kg/day.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} a series of manganese oxides and an analysis of their sorptive, structural, and surface characteristics as low-energetic desiccants for passive dehumidification and active desiccant cooling systems. A cusped Type III isotherm for the adsorption of water is reported for the first time. The data are interpreted as evidence of a first-order phase change from a two-dimensional gas to a liquid film in the first reversibly adsorbed layer. It appears that the water adsorption characteristics of MnO 2 compared to standard <b>desiccants</b> which exhibit <b>Type</b> II isotherms are due at least in part to differences in the physical topography and electronic properties of the desiccant substrates: MnO 2 is a p-type semiconductor with essentially-flat, monoenergetic surface structures, while standard desiccants like silica gel are electronic insulators with irregular, heteroenergetic surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Desiccant {{composites}} {{were prepared}} from a polystyrene homopolymer (PS) {{and a high}} impact copolymer (HIPS). Five zeolites were used as adsorbents which included the A and X types frequently used in industrial practice. Composites containing zeolites up to 50 vol% were homogenized in an internal mixer and then compression molded to 1 mm thick plates. The results proved that the water adsorption capacity of zeolites depends on the total volume of the pores, while the rate of adsorption on thermodynamics, on the equilibrium con-stant of adsorption. On the other hand, zeolite characteristics influence the moisture ad-sorption of the composites only marginally; adsorption capacity is determined by zeolite content, while the rate of adsorption by {{the properties of the}} polymer. Composites prepared with X type zeolites have somewhat smaller water adsorption capacity than those containing their A type counterparts. The dispersion of the zeolite is very good both in PS and in HIPS composites. Mechanical properties are excellent mainly because of the good interfacial adhesion between the components. Because of their larger surface energy, composites containing X type zeolites have larger viscosity and they reinforce the polymer more than A <b>type</b> <b>desiccants.</b> Matrix properties influence mainly application related properties, reinforcement and ductility is better in HIPS than in PS composites...|$|R
30|$|There {{is a very}} {{important}} relationship between energy and water. Water is required by all the resources of energy in their production, e.g. cooling requirement in thermal processes, cleaning processes, cultivation of bio-fuel crops and power turbine (including electricity), whereas energy is required to make the water resources available to the human being for its daily requirements through transport, treatment, pumping and desalination. Since this is the well-known fact that conventional water resources are depleting day by day and thus strives for the alternate ways for the water production Abualhamayel and Gandhidasan (1997) and Gad et al. (2001) stated that there are three ways to produce water from the atmospheric air as condensation method, absorption–regeneration method and absorption–desorption. The condensation method requires a significant amount of energy for its multiple energy conversion processes. In case of absorption- regeneration method, there is requirement of electricity for the circulation of liquid absorbent by a pump and there are maximum chances of corrosion by the liquid desiccant material. The adsorption-desorption method requires no electricity for its working, operates at low temperature, capacity to utilize the solar energy and of lower cost (Gordeeva et al. 2002). Conducted experiments on integrated desiccant collector system for the generation of water from atmospheric air. A thick corrugated layer of cloth was used as a host matrix and CaCl 2 as a desiccant material. The results showed that 1.5  L/m 2 /day of fresh water can be generated by using this system (Hamed 2003). Conducted experiments for the adsorption of water vapor on a sand layer (matrix) impregnated with CaCl 2 (salt). Results showed that rate of absorption depends upon mixing ratio. As the mixing ratio decreases, the adsorption rate decreases (Kabeel 2007). Performed experiments on the glass pyramid solar system to extract water from the atmospheric air. Two beds were prepared by using a cloth and saw wood as a host matrix and saturated with 30  % CaCl 2 solution as a salt. Results showed that 2.5  L/day/m 2 fresh water can be generated by using this setup (Ji et al. 2007). Used composite adsorbent MCM- 41 (Mobile Composite Material) for fresh water production from atmospheric air. The Adsorption capacity of the composite desiccant material was found to be 1.75  kg/kg dry adsorbent. It was stated that new composite material can produce 1.2  kg/day/m 2 of fresh water (Hamed et al. 2011). Conducted experiments by using a composite desiccant material for the generation of water from atmospheric air. Sand was used as a bed and CaCl 2 as a salt. Results showed that 1.0  L/m 2 of fresh water can be generated after regeneration of desiccant material (Kumar and Yadav 2015 a). Conducted experiments by using a composite desiccant material, saw wood/CaCl 2 for the water generation from atmospheric air. It was found that 180  ml/kg/day of fresh water can be generated by using composite desiccant material (Douglas et al. 2005). Performed experiments for the extraction of water from a gas stream i.e. atmospheric air. The gas stream was adsorbed by a porous adsorbent material having a surface modifying agent. When the condition for saturation of water occurs, the surface modifying agent is desorbed from the surface and the water is collected in a condenser. The apparatus and method of this invention is an advantage because it reduced the size and power consumption for the apparatus (Michel 2013). Discloses a device for extracting water contained in the air by condensation is provided. The device includes: a fan for creating an air flow; a heat transfer fluid evaporator for condensing the water in the air flow created by the fan; and a compressor for compressing the heat transfer fluid evaporated by the evaporator, which compressor is placed in the airflow downstream of the evaporator. A system for producing drinking water from the air is also provided, which includes the aforementioned water extraction device (Kumar and Yadav 2015 b). Conducted experiments to investigate the design parameters for solar glass <b>desiccant</b> box <b>type</b> system (SGDBS) for the fresh water generation from atmospheric air. It was stated that for the generation of fresh water the design parameters i.e. height of glass from the desiccant material bed, inclination in angle, effective thickness of glass and number of glazing are 0.22  m, 30 º, 3  mm and single respectively. It was also found that 200  ml/kg/day water can be produced by using these design parameters.|$|R
