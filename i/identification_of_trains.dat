IDENTRA used a removable round circular disc type radio antenna assembly, slide-mounted on the small mounting brackets that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at interlockings near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushing–Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour. The consolidated signal system was in use by 1956 while the selector system was in service by 1958. This system, still in use by many transit agencies such as SEPTA's Broad Street Line, is also nicknamed the [...] "toilet seat" [...] because the removable disc antenna is shaped like a toilet seat.|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{professional}} development {{is important for}} both individual and service development. Staff appraisal {{is central to the}} <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> needs. Recent health-service reforms in the United Kingdom have linked appraisal and training to pay and career progression. This project aimed to explore the conduct of appraisal and the link between appraisal processes and access to continuing education and training. Focus groups were conducted in an urban acute cancer service and a rural community night nursing service to explore these issues. A total of 29 nurses and allied health professionals participated. Transcripts of focus group discussions were analysed for themes, with a deliberate search for counter-instances. Focus groups revealed that appraisal was perceived as frequently rushed and often appeared undervalued by managers. The purpose of appraisal was often misunderstood; and where no clear link existed between appraisal and access to development opportunities, staff viewed appraisal with antipathy. Commissioning <b>of</b> <b>training</b> was insufficiently responsive to identified needs and appeared overly bureaucratic. The study indicates that the link between appraisal processes and the commissioning <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is insufficiently effective.

By enabling greater visibility of their rolling stock, including locomotives and rail-road cars, railroad companies hope to improve their asset utilization, opera-tional safety, and business profitability.

In this article, we present Sensor-Enabled Ambient-Intelligent Telemetry for Trains (SEAIT), which is a WSN-based approach to supporting sensing and communications for advanced freight transportation scenarios. As part of a proof-of-technology exploration, SEAIT was designed to address key requirements of industry proposed applications.

40|$|Most organisations aim to use {{experience}} {{from the past}} to improve safety, for instance through learning from safety-related incidents and accidents. Whether an organisation is able to learn successfully can however only be determined afterwards. So far, there are no proactive measures to assess whether an organisation {{will be able to}} learn from experience, meaning whether an organisation has the propensity to learn. In this study we aimed to develop a set of indicators for the propensity to learn as part of the leading indicators for safety. To assess the propensity to learn, the individual perception of learning from experience is measured, through a set of indicators. These indicators are validated through interviews on a French production site. This organisation showed a high propensity to learn, despite some minor weaknesses with respect to involvement of employees and sharing information. On an individual level, 17 % of the employees had a very positive attitude towards each step of the learning process. The proposed indicators could support the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> weaknesses with respect to learning on an organisational level and they could facilitate the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> needs <b>of</b> the employees.
