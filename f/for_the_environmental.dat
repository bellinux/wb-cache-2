Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E

5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas.

Although not a natural scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> education and training of engineers.|$|E
5|$|Funds {{for the new}} Bonsall bridge were {{approved}} by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February1990, the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, and League for Coastal Protection filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the songbird, {{even though it was}} not a party to the lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.|$|E

25|$|Especially {{after the}} events of the late 1980s, {{international}} organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to build a character process model taking into account serial correlations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> analysis of repeated measurements of semen volume in AI rams. For each ram, measurements were repeated within and across years. Therefore, we considered a model including three <b>environmental</b> effects: <b>the</b> long-term <b>environmental</b> effect, which is a random year* subject effect, <b>the</b> short-term <b>environmental</b> effect, which is a random within year subject* collection effect, and the classical measurement error. We used a four-step approach to build the model. The first step explored graphically the serial correlations. The second step compared four models with different correlation structures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short-term <b>environmental</b> effect. We selected fixed effects in the third step. In the fourth step, we compared four correlation structures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long-term <b>environmental</b> effect. <b>The</b> model, which fitted best the data, used a spatial power correlation structure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short-term <b>environmental</b> effect and a first order autoregressive process <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long-term <b>environmental</b> effect. <b>The</b> heritability estimate was 0. 27 (0. 04), the within year repeatability decreased from 0. 56 to 0. 44 and the repeatability across years decreased from 0. 43 to 0. 37. </p...|$|R
25|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environment and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use {{was a threat to}} wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease vector control continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.|$|E
