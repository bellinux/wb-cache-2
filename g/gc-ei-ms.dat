50|$|The <b>GC-EI-MS</b> is {{also used}} in {{forensic}} science. One example is the analysis of five local anesthetics in blood using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-electron impact ionization selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-EI-SIM). Local anesthesia is widely used but sometimes these drugs can cause medical accidents. In such cases an accurate, simple, and rapid method {{for the analysis of}} local anesthetics is required. <b>GC-EI-MS</b> was used in one case with an analysis time of 65 minutes and a sample size of approximately 0.2 g, a relatively small amount. Another application in forensic practice is the determination of date-rape drugs (DRDs) in urine. These drugs are used to incapacitate victims and then rape or rob them. The analyses of these drugs are difficult due to the low concentrations in the body fluids and often a long time delay between the event and clinical examination. However, using <b>GC-EI-MS</b> allows a simple, sensitive and robust method for the identification, detection and quantification of 128 compounds of DRDs in urine.|$|E

50|$|<b>GC-EI-MS</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for the determination of pesticide residues in fresh food by a single injection analysis. In this analysis 81 multi-class pesticide residues were identified in vegetables. For this study the pesticides were extracted with dichloromethane and further analyzed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS). The optimum ionization method can be identified as EI or chemical ionization (CI) for this single injection of the extract. This method is fast, simple and cost effective since high numbers of pesticides can be determined by GC with a single injection, considerably reducing the total time for the analysis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>GC-EI-MS</b> can be {{incorporated}} {{for the analysis of}} biological fluids for several applications. One example is the determination of thirteen synthetic pyrethroid insecticide molecules and their stereoisomers in whole blood. This investigation used a new rapid and sensitive electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method in selective ion monitoring mode (SIM) with a single injection of the sample. All the pyrethroid residues were separated by using a GC-MS operated in electron ionization mode and quantified in selective ion monitoring mode. The detection of specific residues in blood is a difficult task due to their very low concentration since as soon as they enter the body most of the chemicals may get excreted. However, this method detected the residues of different pyrethroids down to the level 0.05-2 ng / ml. The detection of this insecticide in blood is very important since an ultra-small quantity in the body is enough to be harmful to human health, especially in children. This method is a very simple, rapid technique and therefore can be adopted without any matrix interferences. The selective ion monitoring mode provides detection sensitivity up to 0.05 ng/ml. Another application is in protein turnover studies using <b>GC-EI-MS.</b> This measures very low levels of d-phenylalanine which can indicate the enrichment of amino acid incorporated into tissue protein during studies of human protein synthesis. This method is very efficient since both free and protein-bound d-phenylalanine can be measured using the same mass spectrometer and only a small amount of protein is needed (about 1 mg).|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve chromatographic separation, urine samples shown to be {{initially}} positive for amphetamines and methamphet-amines in US Department of Defense immunoassays are derivatized with R-(2) -a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl) phenylacetyl chloride (R-(2) -MTPA) prior to gas chromatography–electron impact-mass spectrometry (<b>GC–EI-MS)</b> analysis. Phentermine, {{a member of the}} phenethylamine class of drugs and a common appetite suppressant, interferes with <b>GC–EI-MS</b> assays of R-(2) -MTPA-derivatized D-am-phetamine, degrading the chromatography of the internal standard and analyte ions and skewing concentration calculations. Additionally, when specimens with high concentrations of L-metham-phetamine are derivatized with R-(2) -MTPA, signal peaks have the potential to be misidentified by integration software as D-metham-phetamine. We have found that replacing R-(2) MTPA with (S) -(1) -a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl) phenylacetyl chloride reduces phentermine interference problems related to internal standard chro-matography, reduces the possibility of concentrated L-methamphet-amine peaks being misidentified by integration software, improves resolution of D-methamphetamine in the presence of high L-metham-phetamine concentrations, and is a cost-neutral change that can be applied to current amphetamines <b>GC–EI-MS</b> methods without the need for method modification...|$|E

Chlorine/bromine isotope fractionation behaviors of the HOCs in EI-MS showed varied isotope fractionation patterns and extents depending on compounds. Besides, isotope fractionation patterns and extents varied at different EI energies, demonstrating potential impacts of EI energy on the chlorine/bromine isotope fractionation. Hypotheses of inter-ion and intra-ion isotope fractionations were applied to interpreting the isotope fractionation behaviors. The inter-ion and intra-ion isotope fractionations counteractively contributed to the apparent isotope ratio for a certain dehalogenated product ion. The isotope fractionation mechanisms were tentatively elucidated on basis of the quasi-equilibrium theory.

Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/MS and headspace <b>GC-EI-MS</b> platforms. Putative molecular and metabolic markers of grape pre-ripening and ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening. Furthermore, we provide first hints about how the development of a cultivar specific aroma is controlled at transcriptional level...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} study for producing a matrix reference material for selected pesticides in a carrot/potato matrix was investigated. A commercially available baby food (carrot/potato-based mash) was spiked with eleven pesticides at the respective EU {{maximum residue limits}} (MRLs), and further processed by either freeing or freeze-drying. Batches of some 150 units were produced per material type. First, the materials were assessed the relative amount of pesticide recovered after processing (ratio of pesticide concentration in the processed material to the initially spiked pesticide concentration). In addition, the materials' homogeneity (bottle to bottle variation), and the short-term (1 month) and mid-term (5 months) stability at different temperatures were assessed. For this, an in-house validated <b>GC-EI-MS</b> method operated in the SIM mode with a sample preparation procedure based on the QuEChERS ("quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe") principle was applied. Measurements on the frozen material provided the most promising results (smallest analyte losses during production), and also freeze-drying {{proved to be a}} suitable alternative processing technique for most of the investigated pesticides. Both the frozen and the freeze-dried material showed to be sufficiently homogeneous for the intended use, and storage at - 20 °c for 5 months did not reveal any detectable material degradation. The results constitute an important step towards the development of a pesticide matrix reference material. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|N-alkylamides (NAAs) are {{secondary}} metabolites {{occurring in}} many plants. These bioactive compounds, with many structural variations, {{are known to}} exert various pharmacological properties. This group of bioactive plant compounds was investigated in this doctoral research. Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica are plants used in indigenous cultures to treat various stomach disorders. It was already demonstrated that some NAAs {{are responsible for the}} pharmacological properties. Therefore, the NAAs were analytically characterised in both plant extracts using two different analytical techniques (HPLC-ESI-MS and <b>GC-EI-MS).</b> Furthermore, the transdermal and intestinal properties of the plant NAAs pellitorine and spilanthol were evaluated. In this research, these NAAs were topically applied on human skin and orally given to rats to investigate if these NAAs were able to reach the blood circulation. Once in the blood circulation, the blood-brain barrier permeability properties were quantitatively evaluated. The use of a single quadrupole MS detector was shown in high-throughput transdermal research. The advantages of this type of detector were demonstrated, compared to an ultraviolet detector, e. g. a gain in selectivity and lower limit of detections were obtained. Lastly, the regulatory status of N-alkylamide containing health products was discussed. Products containing NAAs are widely available on the market as e. g. food supplements, medicinal products, cosmetics and medical devices. Currently, no unambiguous legal product classification for these products exist. The classification is dependent on the dose of the bioactive NAAs, their (claimed) use and their biological functionalities...|$|E
40|$|A GC-MS {{fingerprinting}} technique {{based on}} the essential oil components has been developed for the discrimination of chuanxiong against Chinese Angelica (Angelica siueusis (Oliv.) Diels) or other herbs with similar compositions. The analytical performance of four different extraction methods for the separation of essential oil components have been compared and these include: ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), Soxhlet extraction (SHE) and hydro-distillation extraction (HDE). The results showed that UAE was the most effective extraction method, and the operational parameters of UAE were optimized. 3 -Butylphthalide, Z-butylidenephthalide, senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, E-butylidenephthalide, senkyunolide A, neocnidilide, Z-Iigustilide and E-ligustilide were tentatively identified in chromatograms of chuanxiong {{based on the}}ir <b>GC-EI-MS</b> data. Similarity coefficient calculations based on correlation methods have been performed on the GC-MS fingerprints. Using an authentic standard Chuanxiong as the reference, the similarity coefficients between the standard and all other chuanxiong samples ranged from 0. 90 to 1. 0 (with 1. 0 being the perfect match), which as a group can be readily separated from the Angelica samples for which the similarity index against the chuanxiong standard ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 77. Conversely, when an authentic Angelica standard {{was used as the}} reference, the respective similarity coefficients fall in the range of 0. 70 - 0. 75 and 0. 98 - 1. 00 for the chuanxiong and Angelica sample groups. Our results thus demonstrate that the fingerprinting technique developed in the study can indeed discriminate the two herbs with high reliability. Nature Science Foundation of China [20235020...|$|E
40|$|A {{biological}} screening {{was performed}} to establish the total exposure to estrogenic compounds of red mullet (Mullus barbatus) collected at several sites along the Spanish Mediterranean coast by testing male fish bile extracts using the in vitro ER-LUC reporter gene assay. In addition, major metabolites were identified and measurements of OH-PAHs (1 -naphthol, 9 -phenantrol, 9 -fluorenol, 1 -pyrenol, 1 OH-BaP and 3 OH-BaP) and alkylphenols (4 - n-nonylphenol (4 - n-NP) and 4 -tertoctylphenol (4 - tert-OP)) in the same fish bile extracts were taken by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in electron ionization mode (<b>GC-EI-MS).</b> Relative in vitro estrogenic potencies of the chemically quantified compounds were also tested. The highest biliary concentrations of 1 -pyrenol, 9 -fluorenol and 4 -n-NP were found in fish from Barcelona and from the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. However, these concentrations can be considered relatively low compared to values reported in red mullet from other polluted waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The contribution of 1 -pyrenol, 4 -n-NP and 4 -tert-OP to the total estrogenic potency measured in male fish bile {{was found to be}} negligible, indicating the presence of other estrogenic compounds in red mullet bile. Estrogenic potency in bile from male fish was markedly elevated in Mar Menor lagoon (234. 8 ± 5. 7. pg. E 2 EQ/μl), and further research will be necessary to explain whether the presence of natural and synthetic-hormones in the lagoon contributed to this finding. Values of approximately 15 - 16. E 2 EQ. pg/mg bile can be regarded as preliminary baseline levels of bile estrogenicity in male red mullet from the western Mediterranean Sea. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} or Krabbe {{disease is}} an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase gene. The {{objective of the}} study was to present information about the fatty acid (FA) composition of the brain and serum of twitcher mice, a mouse model of Krabbe disease, compared to wild type, in order to identify biomarker of disease progression. We defined the FA profiles by identifying the main components present in serum and brain using <b>GC-EI-MS</b> analysis. The FA percentage composition was measured and data were analyzed considering the disease and the mouse age as experimental factors. Significant correlations were established, both in brain and in serum, in the fatty acid percentage composition of twitcher compared to wild type mice. The most abundant saturated fatty acid in brain was the palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) with mean values significantly increased in twitcher mouse (p = 0. 0142); moreover, three monounsaturated, three polyunsaturated (PUFA) and a plasmalogen were significantly correlated to disease. In the serum highly significant differences were observed between the two groups for three polyunsaturated fatty acids. In fact, the docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6 n 3 c) content was significantly increased (p = 0. 0116), while the C 20 PUFA (C 20 : 3 n 6 c and C 20 : 5 n 3 c) were significantly decreased in twitcher serum samples. Our study shows a specific FA profile that may help to define a possible pattern that could distinguish between twitcher and wild type; these data are likely to provide insight in the identification of new biomarkers to monitor the disease progression and thereby permit the critical analysis of therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|The main pathway {{for human}} {{exposure}} to phthalates is via dietary intake. The presence of phthalates in food {{is not only}} because of their movement up the food-chain, but also due to their migration from food packaging into food. In this study, the presence and concentration of phthalates levels in food products on the Belgian market were determined and the various contamination pathways were explored. For this purpose, a sampling campaign and analytical measurements in the laboratory were carried out. Four hundred representative samples of widely consumed foods were purchased in Belgian shops. Sample selection is based on 1) consumption data from the Belgian national food consumption survey and 2) the likelihood that foods contain phthalates. Brand name, packaging material and properties, fat content, date of production or shelf life, time and place of purchase, picture and product specific properties (e. g. pH, preserving agent) were stored in a database. This database was further used to explore the various contamination pathways by identifying relations between measured phthalate concentrations and sample properties. The measurement campaign involves 10 phthalate esters which are determined by <b>GC-EI-MS.</b> Blank concentrations were carefully controlled because phthalates are omnipresent in the laboratory. We developed suitable extraction techniques for the various food matrices. The analysis of food samples on the Belgian market shows a wide variety of phthalate concentrations. Possible contamination causing conditions are e. g. the pH and fat content of the food product and the composition and the properties of the packaging material.
