5|$|Given this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> the Cypria—the {{part of the}} Epic Cycle {{that covers}} {{the period of the}} Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Goryeo (Koryo) {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent Buddhist temples and pagodas were developed based on religious needs, as Buddhism {{played an important role in}} the culture and society at the time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.|$|E

25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked {{to the other two}} adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} citizen might {{not always have}} Mr. Flint by him to {{restrain}} and caution him. But Mr. Flint could have no command over his master's sensations, and anger and apprehension goaded Mr. Worthington to indiscretion.|$|R

2500|$|Since he is a Christian {{as well as}} a {{historian}} of science and a cosmologist, Gingerich has been asked several times to comment on matters concerning the interplay between science and faith. One of these, Intelligent design, he calls an issue with “immense incomprehension from both the friends and foes.” On the one hand, he says that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> {{there seems to be a}} knee-jerk reaction among its critics that I.D. is simply Young Earth creationism in disguise. On the other hand, he says that, while I.D. supporters make a good case for a coherent understanding of the nature of the cosmos, ...|$|E

2500|$|When Lu Ji {{sensed that}} {{his death was}} imminent, he wrote, [...] "During the Han dynasty, there lived Lu Ji, a man from Wu Commandery who had lofty ambitions. When he was young, he read the Classic of Poetry and Book of Documents. When he reached adulthood, he was already very {{familiar}} with the Classic of Rites and Yi Jing. He received orders to lead a military campaign to the south, but was struck by illness. How unfortunate his life was! He died with regrets and sorrow!" [...] He also wrote, [...] "About more than 60 years from now, vehicles {{will be able to}} travel on the same roads, and books will be written in the same script. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> I {{will not be able to}} witness that."

There would be a discussion whenever we faced difficult situations, and when I could not decide on what to do, {{he was the one who}} helped me arrive at my decisions. He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. I suggest that his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households." [...] The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao to Emperor Xian, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Zhen" [...] (貞侯), which literally means [...] "chaste marquis".|$|E
