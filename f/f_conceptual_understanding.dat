The study further investigated the effect of the CLDSLM and DSLM methods on performance in <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and scientific reasoning among students with different motivation levels. A quasi-experimental method with the 3 x 2 Factorial Design was applied in the study. The sample consisted of 240 stu¬dents in six (form four) classes selected from three different schools, i. e. two classes from each school, with students randomly selected and assigned to the treatment groups. The results showed that students in the CLDSLM group outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group—who, in turn, significantly outperformed other students in the traditional instructional method (T) group in scientific reasoning and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> Also, high-motivation (HM) students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the T groups in <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and scientific reasoning. Furthermore, HM students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group in scientific reasoning but did not significantly outperform their counterparts on <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> Also, the DSLM instructional method has significant positive effects on highly motivated students’ (a) <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and (b) scientific reason¬ing.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{possible}} goals that instructors have {{for students in}} general chemistry, {{the idea that they}} will better understand the conceptual underpinnings of the science is certainly important.

This makes them a crucial topic in engineering because almost every engineering branch could be related of used them at different levels. Even though their importance, students often struggle during {{the learning process}} of circuit analysis topics. Additionally, other very important abilities for engineering students are the capacities to create, use, express and think about models and representations of technical concepts; and the capacities to translate and map from one representation to another. These abilities are known as representational competence and representational fluency respectively. ^ The purpose of this exploratory study was to analyze how {{the use of multiple}} representations of technical concepts is related to the <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of those concepts. The methodological approach employed was case study, which was implemented through two cases and focuses on electric circuit analysis at the college level. An activity based on model-eliciting activities was used to assess representational competence, fluency and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of the students in order to explore the relationship between (1) using multiple representations and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and (2) the ability to map between representations and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> ^ The results of this exploratory study indicate that a multi-representational approach can support and foster the learning process and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of electric circuits.
