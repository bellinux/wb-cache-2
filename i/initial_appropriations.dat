The state legislature appropriated an additional $160,000, and in 1891, raised over $123,000 with an additional property tax. Construction on the monument, which began in 1888, took thirteen years to complete. The obelisk was completed in 1892, the main elements by 1894, and its final installations in 1901. In 1893 the circle was renamed Monument Place. The cost to complete the monument was $598,318. An estimate to erect a similar structure in 2014 suggests it would exceed $500 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} federal {{buildings}} changed significantly following {{a fire in}} 1833 that destroyed the Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. Seeking to end the onslaught of fires, the Treasury Department instituted new requirements for fireproofing federal buildings. The <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> for the U.S. Custom House had been for a brick building with wood framing, but Mills designed a solid masonry building. His design demonstrated skill with fireproof construction methods, which remained evident {{in all of his}} later federal commissions.|$|R
50|$|Congress {{established}} a new Home branch in Grant County, Indiana, on March 23, 1888, with an <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> of $200,000, {{based on the}} county residents' providing natural gas supply sufficient for the heating and lighting of the facility. The site selected was near Marion, Indiana, and the new facility was called the Marion Branch. The Marion Branch was the seventh of ten homes and one sanatorium that were built between 1867 and 1902. These homes were primarily intended to provide shelter for the veterans. The homes gradually developed as complete planned communities, with kitchens, gardens and facilities for livestock, designed to be nearly self-sufficient. It appears that these homes were the first non-religious planned communities in the country.|$|R

In response to the importance of New Bedford as a port city, the U.S. Congress authorized the construction of a Custom House in 1832. The <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> was $15,000, but the funds were insufficient to meet new U.S. Treasury Department requirements for fireproof construction. With the allocation of additional appropriations, construction began in 1834. The final cost was approximately $31,000.|$|R

5000|$|Appropriate {{technology}} was also increasingly applied in developed countries. For example, {{the energy crisis}} of the mid-1970s {{led to the creation}} of the National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) in 1977 with an <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> of 3 million dollars from the U.S. Congress. The Center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to [...] "help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life, and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand." [...] However, by 1981 the NCAT's funding agency, Community Services Administration, had been abolished. For several decades NCAT worked with the US departments of Energy and Agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs. Since 2005, NCAT's informational web site is no longer funded by the US government.|$|R
25|$|However, {{this was}} during {{an era of}} rapid shifts within the {{aviation}} industry. The winding-down of major purchases to feed the Vietnam War and Project Apollo was forcing the major aerospace firms to seek ways to diversify, and the government was actively funding a number of mass transit projects in partnership with them. Rivers changed the focus to be a show about any form of transit, not just aircraft, and the size and cost started to increase. He won an <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> of $3 million for the show, but {{had to return to}} Congress for another $2 million to keep it on track as its scale rapidly increased. Critics, notably William Proxmire, attacked the event and claimed that the actual costs would be closer to $10 million when industry input was considered.|$|R

Other early contributors of time and talent included UCA faculty members James Brodman, Eugene Corcoran, Robert Lowrey, and Helen Phillips. The first recruiting class of 1982 included sixty freshmen, together comprising an average ACT score of 26.8. A special Honors Center for honors class instruction was outfitted in the summer of 1983. The Honors program derived its pedagogical underpinnings from the traditional small liberal arts college. The Honors College jealously guarded its small class sizes, intimate teacher/student relationships, a dedicated faculty with tenure in Honors, and intense studies of a variety of interdisciplinary subjects.|$|R

50|$|In 2006 the art {{historian}} Josef Helfenstein wrote:From {{the very beginning}} of her outstanding but unknown career, Sterne maintained an individual profile in the face of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman, all of whom she knew personally. Her independence reflected an immense artistic and personal integrity. The astonishing variety of Sterne's work, spanning from her <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> of surrealist techniques, to her investigation of conceptual painting, and her unprecedented installations in the 1960s, exemplify her adventurous spirit. Yet, the heterogeneity of her styles, and her complete disinterest in the commercially driven art world, have contributed to her exclusion from the canon. When the heroic male narratives of modernism begin to fade, we may, eventually, be ready to recognize this amazingly idiosyncratic body of work. Sterne's art is, indeed, a manifesto in favor of the untamable forces of the mind and the continually changing flux of life.|$|R

CORF built 14 gros ouvrages (large artillery positions) and 24 petit ouvrages (more lightly armed infantry works), {{as well as more}} than one hundred casemates and infantry shelters in the RF Metz. In 1929 an <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> of 1,498,000,000 francs was allotted to the RF Metz, the most expensive region in the Maginot system. The highest-priority positions in the RF Metz were ouvrages Rochonvillers and Hackenberg, with work beginning in 1929. A continuation of the construction campaign starting in 1930 resulted in the construction of three more large positions, six lesser artillery ouvrages, and seven infantry positions. Four interval casemates were built in 1930. At the same time, a program to provide the Line with long-range artillery was gradually dropped as costs mounted. By November 1930 the RF Metz had been allocated 2,298,000,000 francs.|$|R

Since 2001, it has been possible to obtain an academic certification by valuing learning, regardless of its origin. The current {{study was conducted with}} trainers and adults who were involved in processes of recognition, validation and certification of competences (RVCC). This research study, using qualitative research methods, described and tried to develop the comprehension of the use of referentials as instruments of trainersâ activity. This analysis focused especially on three aspects: (i) the organization and development of RVCC processes; (ii) trainersâ role in these processes; and (iii) the use of a referential as an instrument of activity. The findings suggested that the referential used in these processes mediates trainersâ activity, functioning as competences identification guides. After an <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation,</b> trainers reconceptualize the referential by creating their own grids. There is clear variability in the use of this guiding document. Trainers revealed ambivalence towards the autonomy that they have in their work activity. Although they assess the opportunity to individually and freely create their work instruments in a positive way, they also lack a collective support and validation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This article interprets Pam Gemsâs play Queen Christina as an avant la lettre {{thesis on}} the {{performance}} of gender, identifying correspondences between the protagonistâs trajectory and the successive feminist interventions. Focusing on the 17 th-century Swedish queenâs transformation from a masculine-identified bastion of patriarchy into an untamed rebel against political and sexual conserva-tism, Gems, in fact, indirectly shares her views on aspects of western feminist thought. This articleâs analysis demonstrates that following Christinaâs <b>initial</b> <b>appropriation</b> and subsequent contestation of patriarchal values, she engages with radical feminism before briefly identifying herself as a socialist feminist. In the wake of her unfulfilled attempt at maternity, she moves on to embrace cultural feminism; though, eventually, she decides not to privilege any specific political position and thus echoes Gemsâs own ambivalence and reservation towards explicit ideological commitment. KEY WORDS British drama â¦ feminism â¦ mothering/motherhood â¦ patriarchy â¦ performance of gender â¦ sexuality â¦ women and theatre â¦ women in performance â¦ womenâs history This article reflects on the interface between women, performance and experimentation with gender issues, via an analysis of a landmark play in British womenâs theatre: Pam Gemsâs 1977 Queen Christina. The article juxtaposes as its major concerns the work of a female artist (Pam Gems as a postwar British playwright), the latterâs approach to the dramatic representation of femininity, and, last but not least, references to the historical figure behind Gemsâs play, the 17 th-century queen of Sweden.
