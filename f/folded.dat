Geometric and kinematic modeling of individual <b>folds</b> reveals that no single fault-related <b>fold</b> model can reproduce the geometry of a given <b>fold.</b> Instead, successful forward modeling of the <b>folds</b> requires some combination of detachment <b>folding</b> with fault-bend <b>folding</b> or fault-propagation <b>folding.</b> All <b>folds</b> followed one of two kinematic paths: the initially parallel <b>folds</b> either broke through without flattening or flattened first and then broke through. Preferred hypothesis for why <b>folds</b> would deform by one path verses the other include: I) Original asymmetry will promote breakthrough over flattening, so that originally asymmetric <b>folds</b> will break through without flattening while initially symmetric <b>folds</b> will flatten before breaking through; and 2) A thin detachment unit may limit <b>fold</b> growth resulting in breakthrough without flattening, while a thick detachment units will not limit <b>fold</b> growth, allowing <b>folds</b> to shorten via flattening before breaking through...|$|R

40|$|We review <b>fold</b> usage on {{completed}} genomes {{to explore}} protein structure evolution. The patterns of {{presence or absence}} of <b>folds</b> on genomes gives us insights into the relationships between <b>folds,</b> the age of different <b>folds</b> and how we have arrived at the set of <b>folds</b> we see today. We examine the relationships between different measures which describe protein <b>fold</b> usage, such as the number of copies of a <b>fold</b> per genome, the number of families per <b>fold,</b> and the number of genomes a <b>fold</b> occurs on. We obtained these measures of <b>fold</b> usage by searching for the structural domains on 157 completed genome sequences from all three kingdoms of life. In our comparisons of these measures we found that bacteria have relatively more distinct <b>folds</b> on their genomes than archaea. Eukaryotes were found to have many more copies of a <b>fold</b> on their genomes. If we separate out the different <b>fold</b> classes, the alpha/beta class has relatively fewer distinct <b>folds</b> on large genomes, more copies of a <b>fold</b> on bacteria and more <b>folds</b> occurring in all three kingdoms simultaneously. These results possibly indicate that most alpha/beta <b>folds</b> originated earlier than other <b>folds.</b> The expected power law distribution is observed for copies of a <b>fold</b> per genome and we found a similar distribution for the number of families per <b>fold.</b> However, a more complicated distribution appears for <b>fold</b> occurrence across genomes, which strongly depends on <b>fold</b> class and kingdom. We also show {{that there is not a}} clear relationship between the three measures of <b>fold</b> usage.

50|$|Two {{common types}} of forced <b>folds</b> are, namely, fault-bend <b>fold</b> and fault-propagation <b>fold.</b> <b>Folding</b> occurs above the hanging {{wall of a}} <b>fold</b> ramp in a fault-bend <b>fold,</b> while <b>folding</b> occurs above the {{truncation}} of a thrust fault(fault tip) in a fault-propagation <b>fold.</b> They are usually highly asymmetric with {{one side of the}} limb much steeper than the other side. Shortening stress is usually at a high angle to the strata and is concentrated along the slipping plane and in the hanging wall of the thrust fault. The <b>fold</b> acquires higher amplitude, longer wavelength and broader width as rock slips along the fault plane of the underlying coeval thrust fault, casting major influence on the three dimensional growth of the <b>fold.</b> Therefore, forced <b>folds</b> are controlled by the fault structure in the basement rocks along planar or listric fault surfaces. The amount of fault displacement would control the amplitude of a <b>fold,</b> the lateral growth of fault would implies lateral growth of <b>fold</b> and fault linkage implies <b>fold</b> linkage on the surface. When compared to detachment <b>folds,</b> contrasting competency across strata is not as pronounced and the tectonic environments that they are found in are often more diverse.A detachment <b>fold</b> can evolve into a forced <b>fold</b> when shortening stress exceeds the maximum strength of rock, and as a result the decollement may propagate upwards towards the anticlinal core and fault the detachment <b>fold.</b> The resultant structure poses characteristics of both detachment <b>fold</b> and fault propagation <b>fold.</b> An exemplar structure of this kind can be found in Mississippi Fan <b>fold</b> belt in Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
40|$|Granulite- to amphibolite-facies {{metamorphic}} terrain lies on {{the coastline}} of Luzow-Holm Bay (LHB) and Prince Olav Coast (POC). To examine as to whether there are distinct difference {{in the mode of}} deformation from place to place, we studied <b>fold</b> structures of the LHB and POC regions during JARE- 33 and - 34. Here we define five <b>fold</b> elements, F_, F_, F_n, F_ and F_, in developing order. F_n <b>folding</b> : F_n <b>folds</b> are isoclinal and generally overturned (recumbent) <b>folds</b> with subhorizontal <b>fold</b> axes, and were dominantly developed in such area as Botnnuten, Rundvagshetta, Berrodden, Skallen, Austhovde, Padda, Skarvsnes, Breidvagnipa, the Ongul Islands, Akarui Point, Kasumi Rock and Cape Hinode. The plunge of F_n <b>folds</b> is generally parallel to those of the dominant mineral lineation (L_n) defined by sillimanite, orthopyroxene, hornblende, feldspar and quartz. Aligned biotite grains in garnet-biotite gneiss show axial plane foliation of the F_n <b>fold</b> except at the Rundvagshetta region where they crosscut the axial surfaces of F_n <b>folds.</b> The wavelength (up to hundreds of meters) depends on the layer thickness, implying that F_n <b>folds</b> were buckled <b>folds.</b> Thus asymmetry of smaller-scale <b>folds</b> indicates the larger regional enveloping surfaces. In Skarvsnes, the F_n <b>folds</b> partially exhibit sheath shapes. The F_n <b>folds</b> were clearly refolded by gentle <b>folds.</b> Post-F_n <b>folding</b> : Gentle <b>folds</b> commonly developed in the same areas where F_n <b>folding</b> are observed. These gentle <b>folds</b> have subvertical axial planes and subhorizontal <b>fold</b> axes and are characterized by buckling (up to 5 km in wavelength). Two stages of gentle-folds are recognized in Botnnuten, East Ongul Island, Akarui Point and Kasumi Rock as well as Skarvsnes and Skallen (T. ISHIKAWA : Mem. Natl Inst. Polar Res., Ser. C, 9, 1, 1976; M. YOSHIDA : J. Geosci., Osaka City Univ., 21, 65, 1978). This suggests that development of gentle <b>folds</b> of two deformational stages (F_ and F_) succeeded to the intense F_n <b>folding</b> in the LHB and POC regions. In Botnnuten, Skallen, Austhovde, Padda, Skarvsnes, the Ongul Islands, Akarui Point, Kasumi Rock and Cape Hinode, these <b>fold</b> axes are subparallel to those of F_n <b>folds.</b> In addition, the gentle <b>folding</b> interfered dip angles of aligned biotite grains except in Rundvagshetta where biotite shows axial-plane foliation of gentle <b>folds.</b> The plunges of <b>fold</b> axes of F_n <b>folds</b> and L_n mineral lineation are disturbed in Botnnuten, Berrodden, Skallen, Skarvsnes, the Ongul Islands, Akarui Point and Kasumi Rock where gentle <b>folds</b> oblique to F_n <b>folds</b> were developed. In these regions, dome and basin structures are recognized, besides previous study showed similar interference pattern in Sinnan Rock (Y. HIROI et al. : Geological Map of Sinnan Rocks, Antarctica. Antarct. Geol. Map Ser., Sheet 14. Tokyo, Natl Inst. Polar Res., 1983). Pre-F_n <b>folding</b> : F_n <b>folds</b> partially deformed pre-F_n <b>folds</b> (F_ <b>fold)</b> in Rundvagshetta, Berrodden, Skarvsnes, East Ongul Island, Kasumi Rock and Cape Hinode. They are isoclinal <b>folds</b> which have <b>fold</b> axes subparallel to those of F_n <b>fold.</b> The wavelength ranges up to a few meters. F_ <b>folds</b> are isoclinal <b>folds</b> refolded by F_ <b>folds.</b> The F_ <b>folds</b> are observed only in one outcrop of Rundvagshetta. Axial surfaces of F_ and F_ <b>folds</b> are crosscut by aligned biotite grains. Conclusions are summarized as follows, (1) The metamorphic terrain of the LHB and POC regions may be termed a recumbent gneiss terrain. (2) Not only isoclinal <b>folds</b> but also gentle <b>folds</b> are widespread over the LHB and POC regions, and there is no distinctive difference between the LHB and POC regions with respect to the mode of <b>fold</b> structures. (3) F_n <b>folding</b> is not an initial deformation in the LHB and POC regions, but postdated earlier <b>folding</b> (F_ and F_) ...|$|R
