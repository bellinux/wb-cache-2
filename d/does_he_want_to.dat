500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E

2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> own today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where do you want to go to today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk. In addition to containing a series of minigames for the player to explore, the software also offered enhancements to Windows 95, while additional content was available via the game's official website. Microshaft Winblows 98s animation and programming were outsourced to WayForward Technologies while Chronic Music handled the music and sound effects. The product was also released in the French language.|$|E

Well, in a legal inquiry (or a medical inquiry, for that matter) ten to one he won't be allowed to read them. He'll be tripped up every two or three minutes with some tangle of old rules.

What are the three main functions which that child--that charming child of yours-performs? He sucks; he sleeps; and he grows. At the present moment, he isn't sucking, he isn't sleeping--he is growing with all his might. Under those interesting circumstances, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do? To move his limbs freely in every direction. You let him swing his arms to his heart's content--and you deny him freedom to kick his legs. You clothe him in a dress three times as long as himself.

There is his senseless long dress entangling itself in his toes, and making an effort of what Nature intended to be a luxury. Can anything be more absurd? What are mothers about?
