25|$|The title {{requires}} some clarification. “In {{the words of}} Aristotle: ‘catastrophe is an action bringing ruin and pain on stage, where corpses are seen and wounds and other similar sufferings are performed,’”. Malone refers to “Catastrophe … in the old sense … o be buried alive in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of.” The more obvious definition applies of course to the act of defiance itself; the effect <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> catastrophic.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the {{new housing}} projects, Huei Long Hospital (迴龍醫院) was initiated, {{but instead of}} ‘houses’ which were earlier promised to the patients, the new {{director}} gave them two tall buildings with modern hospital facilities. It {{became clear that the}} new administration team intended to run a hospital business. The skyscraper-ish hospital buildings were designed mainly for housing short-term patients; therefore it has inadequate space for residents to move around freely. Moreover, the hospital management team forbids the patients from bringing with them personal belongings, from cooking, and from coming over to the front building, which policy <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> discriminative.|$|E

Shawn Perry of Vintage Rock also admires {{the range of}} sounds, saying: [...] "incidental passages, scads of sitar, sarod and tabla, Dixieland cutaways, 'Cowboy Music,' church bells, chirps, acoustic guitar, space rock riffs, piano, horns – you name it and he threw it in." [...] Perry adds: [...] "Listening to it nowadays <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> sheer delight." ...|$|E

500|$|Books {{four and}} five largely concern {{themselves}} with [...] "the effects of particular celestial phenomena on the native". Book four covers many topics which originated in Egypt, leading Goold to suggest that Manilius based his work on an Egyptian source. Much of the first portion of this book deals with decans and the partes damnandae, both of which allow Manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse. A short description of the rising of individual degrees of the ecliptic transitions to a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography. Near {{the end of the}} book Manilius turns his attention to the ecliptic signs. The book is punctuated at lines 4.387407 and 4.866935 by [...] "exhortation of the frustrated student", where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by assertions that [...] "the object of study <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> (union with) god" [...] and [...] "the universe (microcosm) wishes to reveal itself to man".|$|E
500|$|In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren {{argued that}} [...] "Citizenship is man's basic right, for it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{the right to}} have rights" [...] and that [...] "a {{government}} of the people cannot take away their citizenship simply because one branch of that government can be said to have a conceivably rational basis for wanting to do so." [...] While Warren was willing to allow for loss of citizenship as a result of foreign naturalization or other actions [...] "by which [...] manifests allegiance to a foreign state [...] may be so inconsistent with the retention of [...] citizenship as to result in loss of that status", he wrote that [...] "In specifying that any act of voting in a foreign political election results in loss of citizenship, Congress has employed a classification so broad that it encompasses conduct that fails to show a voluntary abandonment of American citizenship." ...|$|E
500|$|The koala {{was heavily}} hunted by European {{settlers}} in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing {{in a letter to}} The Courier-Mail, expressed the popular sentiment: [...] "The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> barbarous... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account... He affords no sport to the gun-man... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas." [...] Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month open season in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.|$|E

2500|$|The American Chassidic author Yonassan Gershom {{wrote that}} Bailey's {{plan for a}} New World Order and her call for [...] "the gradual dissolution—again if in any way possible—of the Orthodox Jewish faith" [...] {{revealed}} that [...] "her goal <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the destruction of Judaism itself." [...] Gershom also wrote that [...] "This stereotyped portrayal of Jews {{is followed by a}} hackneyed diatribe against the Biblical Hebrews, based upon the [...] "angry Jehovah" [...] theology of nineteenth-century Protestantism.

2500|$|Vaillant also {{published}} a concise textbook of Romanian language and grammar (1836), {{intended as a}} learning instrument for French people (Grammaire valaque à l'usage des français). It featured a glossary, {{as well as a}} historical overview and translations of poems (notably, Vasile Cârlova's Ruinurile Târgoviştii and Heliade Rădulescu's Visul). In the preface to this work, Vaillant stressed the Latin origin of the Romanian language (in relation to other Romance languages), and, elaborating, argued that [...] "Wallachian <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a dialect of the Roumannesque language, a name which in itself serves to indicate its descent".|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrance}} {{itself is}} crowned by a bas-relief representing two {{images of the}} king worshipping the falcon-headed Ra Harakhti, whose statue stands in a large niche. This god is holding the hieroglyph [...] "user" [...] and a feather in his right hand, with Ma'at, (the goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a gigantic cryptogram for Ramesses II's throne name, User-Maat-Re. The facade is topped by a row of 22 baboons, their arms raised in the air, supposedly worshipping the rising sun. Another notable feature of the facade is a stele which records the marriage of Ramesses with a daughter of king Hattusili III, which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites.|$|E
2500|$|This {{belief in}} {{heritability}} of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing {{it at the}} highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the [...] "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the composition of the next generation.... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." [...] This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Salon, his paintings—Self-Portrait, {{portraits of}} the Rivière family, and Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne—received a very chilly reception. David {{delivered}} a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard (Le Pausanias Français, 1806) [...] praised [...] "the fineness of Ingres's brushwork and the finish", but condemned Ingres's style as gothic and asked: How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture? The answer is {{that he wanted to}} do something singular, something extraordinary... M. Ingres's intention <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.|$|E
2500|$|Basically unbiased, Hollinger's review lists many of Kenney's influences, citing textual {{references}} {{throughout the}} book. In a way, however, Hollinger agrees with Lasher's take on Kenney's conglomerate style without necessarily agreeing. While he does say that [...] "the poem's rapid-fire imagery" [...] leaves [...] "the reader left to connect disparate metaphors and references," [...] Hollinger {{does not go}} into further detail or analysis on the subject. He does, however, praise Kenney's [...] "adroit use of alliteration, consonance, and assonance," [...] going further to call The Invention of the Zero an [...] "epic rendition of creation"—but not in the religious sense. Hollinger says that [...] "the book's subject <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{the history of the}} universe, from Chaos and the Big Bang to the invention of the computer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W.

2500|$|Although the Ninth Circuit {{allowed the}} plaintiffs {{to proceed with}} their claims of conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, and an {{accounting}} against the Vatican Bank, it agreed to the dismissal of the claims against the Croatian Liberation Movement and {{the claim that the}} Vatican bank supported the Ustaše in committing genocide and other war crimes. The majority opinion was written by Judge M. Margaret McKeown, with Senior Judge Milton Irving Shadur concurring. Judge Stephen S. Trott dissented in part, arguing that the district court had correctly dismissed the case. Trott wrote: [...] "What the majority has unintentionally accomplished in embracing this case <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the wholesale creation of a World Court, an international tribunal with breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction to entertain the World's failures, no matter where they happen, when they happen, to whom they happen, the identity of the wrongdoer, and the sovereignty of one of the parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1990s, {{intelligent}} design {{had become a}} separate movement. The creation science movement is distinguished from the {{intelligent design}} movement, or neo-creationism, because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account {{through the use of}} science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its polemics and stated goals (see Wedge strategy). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the intelligent designer as God in their public arguments, intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the First Amendment's prohibition against religious infringement. However, the intelligent design curriculum was struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, the judge in the case ruling [...] "that ID <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the progeny of creationism." ...|$|E
