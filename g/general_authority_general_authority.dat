50|$|Due to this change, no general {{auxiliary}} presidencies {{are composed}} of <b>general</b> <b>authorities.</b> Rather, the <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> seventies remain active in <b>general</b> church committees and have less jurisdiction over local stakes, particularly in North America. Generally, stake presidents now report to area seventies, who in turn report to area presidencies, which are usually composed of <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> seventies. In North America, there are no area presidencies, {{with members of the}} Presidency of the Seventy taking the responsibility of overseeing the areas.|$|R

[...] Although no specific change in policy or practice was announced, at the church's general conference in October 2015, those released from the Second Quorum of the Seventy were designated as emeritus <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> for the first time. [...] They remain <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> until their deaths, but an emeritus <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> is not a member of a seventies quorum. John K. Carmack, {{the former head of the}} Perpetual Education Fund and W. Rolfe Kerr, a former Church Commissioner of Education, are both emeritus <b>general</b> <b>authorities.</b> Jacob de Jager served as a bishop after he was given emeritus status. [...] In the general conference meeting in which Ezra Taft Benson was first sustained as president of the church, the emeritus <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> were sustained.

5000|$|In the {{biannual}} general conferences of {{the church}} held in April and October, all of the <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>general</b> officers {{of the church}} are presented to the Latter-day Saints for a sustaining vote, {{in accordance with the}} church's interpretation of the principle of [...] "common consent". This is a voluntary indication made by each member (usually by raising the hand) that the member assents to be led by the individuals presented as <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>general</b> officers. Members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are always named by name, as are any persons being added or released from a position or any <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> or <b>general</b> officer moving from one organization to another (e.g., a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy being called to the Presidency of the Seventy). Otherwise, the <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>general</b> officers of the church are simply sustained [...] "as presently constituted".|$|R

5000|$|In the LDS Church today, each {{auxiliary}} {{organization is}} headed by a [...] "general president" [...] and two counselors; the three individuals together form the [...] "general presidency" [...] of the auxiliary.

5000|$|As {{with any}} calling in the church, <b>general</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>general</b> {{officers}} serve [...] "until they are released".

50|$|This {{biannual}} {{procedure is}} dictated by church theology, {{which states that}} the church shall be governed by the common consent of its membership.

50|$|Regional {{representative}} of the Twelve, commonly shorted to regional representative or regional rep, was a priesthood calling in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) between 1968 and 1995.
