30|$|The {{amount of}} charge {{transfer}} between <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> and H atoms {{can be estimated}} by projecting the charge density onto the atomic orbitals. We define the charge transfer as {{the difference between the}} Löwdin charges [16] for isolated <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> with H atoms. From this result, one can determine whether H atom acts as an acceptor or as a donor. The donor behavior of H atoms causes the Fermi level of <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> with H atoms to shift upward, and its acceptor behavior causes the Fermi level of <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> with H atoms to shift downward with respect to the Fermi level of <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{nanoscale}} {{peeling of}} the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> on the graphite surface is numerically studied by molecular mechanics simulation. For center-lifting case, the successive partial peelings of the graphene around the lifting center appear as discrete jumps in the force curve, which induce the arched deformation of the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet.</b> For edge-lifting case, marked atomic-scale friction of the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> during the nanoscale peeling process is found. During the surface contact, the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> takes the atomic-scale sliding motion.

40|$|Understanding the {{interaction}} mechanisms of CO, NO, SO 2, and HCHO with graphene {{are important in}} developing graphene-based sensors for gas detection and removal. In this study, the effects of doped Ti or N atom on {{the interaction}} of these gases with graphene were investigated by density functional theory calculations. Analyses of adsorption energy, electron density difference, and density of states indicated that the doped Ti atom could greatly improve the interaction of gas molecules with graphene. The Ti-doped <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> demonstrated selective gas absorption. The order of interaction between the gas molecules and the Ti-doped <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> was as follows: SO 2 > NO > HCHO > CO. By contrast, the N-doped <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> did not exhibit apparent selective gas absorption. These results imply that the Ti-doped <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is more effective than}} the N-doped <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> in detecting and removing gas molecules because of its high selectivity.

40|$|We have {{performed}} an ab initio theoretical investigation of <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> adsorbed on amorphous SiO_ 2 surface (G/a-SiO_ 2). We find that graphene adsorbs on the a-SiO_ 2 surface through van der Waals interactions. The inhomogeneous topology of the a-SiO_ 2 clean surface promotes a total charge density displacement on the adsorbed <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{giving rise to}} electron-rich as well as hole-rich regions on the graphene.

Furthermore, the adsorbed <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> exhibits a net total charge density gain. In this case, the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> becomes n-type doped, however, with no formation of chemical bonds at the graphene [...] SiO_ 2 interface.

The MD simulations show that the CNT is able to store {{a vast amount of}} mechanical strain energy because of the formation of kinks on its wall at the regions of maximum curvature. The sudden release of the strain energy upon releasing the bent CNT can cause its tip to approach a speed of 7000 m/s. Even with such a high speed collision with a monolayer <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet,</b> the CNT and the monolayer <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> remain completely intact and do not suffer any damage. The instantaneous average impact pressure between the CNT and the <b>graphene</b> <b>sheet</b> is calculated to be in the range of 1 - 10 GPa for different temperatures and aspect ratios of the CNT.
