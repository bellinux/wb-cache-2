50|$|In certain circumstances, a {{specially}} designed custom-made graft device ("endograft"), which has holes (fenestrations) on the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> to maintain the patency of the visceral arteries, {{is used for the}} procedure, which is called FEVAR (fenestrated endovascular aortic/aneurysm repair). When the aneurysm begins at close to the renal arteries, standard EVAR may be contraindicated since there will be an inadequate length of suitable aorta for the endograft attachment. In these cases a fenestrated endograft may be useful, where the attachment of the endograft to the aorta may be placed above the renal arteries with each fenestration opposite a renal artery so that blood flow to the kidneys is maintained. Fenestrated EVAR has been in use in the United Kingdom for over a decade and nationwide early results were published in the journal Circulation in Jun 2012.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about the late {{clinical}} outcomes of patients undergoing saphenous vein graft percutaneous coronary intervention (SVG-PCI), and there are controversies regarding the role of lesion location (aorto-ostial or <b>graft</b> <b>body).</b> MethodsSingle-center registry including patients undergoing SVG-PCI between 2006 and 2011. Aorto-ostial lesion was defined as a lesion within the first 8 mm of the graft; <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> lesion was defined as a lesion located in the remaining portions of the graft. Interventions approaching only the distal anastomosis or the native coronary bed were excluded. We evaluated the rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) between the groups. ResultsOne hundred and ninety-five patients were evaluated, 69 in the Aorto-Ostial Group and 126 in the <b>Graft</b> <b>Body</b> Group. Mean age was 69. 6 ± 10. 2 years, 41 % were diabetic, 65. 1 % had acute coronary syndromes and most of them were treated with bare metal stents (82. 5 %). There was no statistical difference between groups for most of the characteristics evaluated. In the late follow-up, the TVR rate (50. 8 % vs. 22 %; P = 0. 03) was greater in the Aorto-Ostial Group. The MACE rate (67. 7 % vs. 63. 3 %; P = 0. 33), death (31. 7 % vs. 35. 6 %; P = 0. 95) and MI (55 % vs. 42 %; P = 0. 64) were similar between the two groups. ConclusionsThis population included a high-risk subgroup, with high late mortality rates, regardless of the location of the lesion in the graft. In patients treated predominantly by baremetal stents, aorto-ostial lesions had a higher reintervention rate when compared to <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> lesions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveAccumulation {{of smooth}} muscle cells and {{extracellular}} matrix in the intima of artery bypass grafts induces neointimal hyperplasia, resulting in graft failure. We investigated the inhibitory effect of locally applied cilostazol, an inhibitor of {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} phosphodiesterase III, on neointimal hyperplasia {{and the role of}} tenascin-C synthesis and smooth muscle cell proliferation in free artery grafts. Methods and resultsWe established a distal anastomotic stricture model of free artery graft stenosis using rat abdominal aorta. In this model, neointimal hyperplasia was observed not only in the distal anastomotic site but also in the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> at postoperative day 14 and was markedly progressed at day 28. Strong expression of tenascin-C was found in the media and neointima of the <b>graft</b> <b>body.</b> When cilostazol was locally administered around the graft using Pluronic gel, neointimal hyperplasia of the graft was significantly suppressed in comparison with gel-treated control graft. The mean neointima/media area ratio was reduced by 86. 6 % for the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> and by 75. 8 % for the distal anastomotic site versus the control. Cilostazol treatment decreased cell proliferation and tenascin-C expression in the neointima. In an in vitro experiment using cultured smooth muscle cells isolated from rat aorta, cilostazol completely suppressed the tenascin-C mRNA expression induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB. ConclusionA single topical administration of cilostazol may suppress neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting cell proliferation and tenascin-C synthesis in free artery grafts, presenting the potential for clinical use in vascular surgery...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different reconstruction intervals of retrospectively electrocardiographically (ECG) -gated multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography on image quality of different segments of various types of coronary artery bypass grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with 62 grafts underwent retrospectively ECG-gated four-channel multi-detector row CT angiography and conventional coronary angiography. Raw helical CT data were reconstructed at 0 %- 90 % of the cardiac cycle in increments of 10 %. Each graft was separated into three segments (proximal segment, <b>graft</b> <b>body,</b> and distal anastomosis). Three graft types were identified according to site of distal anastomosis. Two readers assessed image quality of segments and graft types. Effective radiation dose was calculated. RESULTS: Best image quality of all segments was obtained at a reconstruction interval of 50 %- 70 % of the cardiac cycle. Image quality of the proximal segment did not vary significantly with different reconstruction intervals (analysis of variance, P =. 8), whereas image quality of the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> and distal anastomosis changed significantly with varying reconstruction intervals (P <. 001). Distal anastomosis and body of types 1 and 2 grafts were best seen at 60 %- 70 % of the cardiac cycle, whereas distal anastomosis and body of type 3 grafts were best visualized at 50 %. Accuracy of CT angiography for detection of graft patency was 94 % for reader 1 and 95 % for reader 2. Effective dose for CT was 11. 4 mSv {{for both men and}} women. Mean effective dose for angiography was 2. 1 mSv for men and women. CONCLUSION: Optimal selection of reconstruction interval improves image quality of the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> and of distal anastomosis in particular...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Patients {{who have}} failing infrainguinal bypass grafts or failed grafts reopened with lytic therapy {{represent}} a group {{at high risk}} of subsequent failure. Previous studies suggest that vein patch angioplasty and jump grafting may be less durable than interposition grafting as a method of correcting graft lesions. Our objective was to assess the value of various technical strategies for graft revision in a series of autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafts and to assess how these variables might affect cumulative graft patency (CGP) rates. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course, anatomic sites of revision, and type of revision performed on 67 grafts in 58 patients who underwent at least one revision from 1991 to 1995. Results were assessed with regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier estimates of CGP rates (p 1 segment) grafts, with an overall 5 -year CGP rate of 72 %. No difference was observed between the 4 -year CGP rate in grafts with hemodynamically significant distal anastomotic stenoses repaired primarily with jump grafts (n = 20, 71 % CGP rate) and those with stenoses found only in the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> (n = 41, 89 % CGP rate). Vein patch angioplasty was used primarily, but not exclusively, for focal <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> stenoses (n = 35), whereas interposition grafts (n = 11) were reserved for more diffuse strictures; no significant difference in 3 -year CGP rates was observed (94 % and 73 %, respectively). Conclusion: Using an appropriate revision strategy that favors vein patch angioplasty for <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> lesions and jump grafts for distal anastomotic lesions, acceptable assisted patency rates can be achieved in grafts that are at risk for repeated failure.

40|$|Fifty-eight {{patients}} {{have been treated}} for recurrent lower limb ischemia following bypass surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease over a three-year period. Based on clinical case notes, angiograms, operative notes and histologic examination of endarterectomy specimens, 32 patients (55. 2 %) {{were found to have}} progressive atherosclerotic occlusion involving the inflow (seven patients) or outflow (25 patients) tracts. Seven patients (12. 0 %) had problems related to graft angulation or mural thrombus fragmentation and, in four patients, anastomotic fibroplasia was demonstrated. Fifteen patients (25. 9 %) had not had their disease bypassed by the primary operation and required reoperation within one year. It is suggested that the use of juxtarenal end-to-end proximal anastomosis, extending to the groins distally in most cases, and good graft to host size match may be important considerations. Management entailed major aortic reconstructions in 28 patients, and local groin procedures or crossover grafts in 30 patients. There was one postoperative death (1. 7 %). Two patients had amputations (3. 4 %) although all grafts were functioning at the time the patients were discharged from the hospital. Major complications were more frequent following aortic reconstruction, and operations of this magnitude may, possibly, be confined to patients with aortic inflow obstruction, infection involving the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> or redundancy of the <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> causing sufficient angulation to cause obstruction...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} success of {{percutaneous}} transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in treating peripheral bypass stenoses. METHODS: Patients who received a femoropopliteal or femorocrural bypass graft for limb ischemia were included in a duplex surveillance program. If duplex ultrasound revealed a short (/= 4. 5) stenosis, patients were scheduled for arteriography and PTA. Fifty-eight peripheral bypass stenoses in 39 grafts in 37 patients were treated with PTA. The cumulative primary patency of treated stenoses was calculated. RESULTS: During {{the first year after}} PTA 31 (53 %) treated lesions remained patent, 15 (26 %) lesions restenosed at a median interval of 5. 0 (range 1 - 12) months and 4 (7 %) bypasses occluded. The cumulative primary patency of 58 treated graft stenoses at 1 year was 60 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 46 %- 74 %] and 55 % (95 % CI 41 %- 70 %) at 2 years. <b>Graft</b> <b>body</b> stenoses showed a better 2 -year cumulative primary patency (86 %; 95 % CI 68 %- 100 %) compared with juxta-anastomotic lesions (45 %; 95 % CI 29 %- 62 %; p < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: New {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} to expand indications for liver surgery. The objective was to evaluate the current practice worldwide regarding critical liver mass and manipulation of the liver volume. METHODS: A survey was sent to 133 liver centers worldwide, which focused on (a) critical liver volume, (b) preoperative manipulation of the liver mass, and (c) use of liver biopsy and metabolic tests. RESULTS: The overall response rate to the survey was 75 %. Half of the centers performed more than 100 resections per year; 86 % had an associated liver transplant program. The minimal remnant liver volume for resection was 25 % (15 - 40 %) in cases of normal liver parenchyma and 50 % (25 - 90 %) in the presence of underlying cirrhosis. The minimal remnant liver volume for living donors was 40 % (30 - 50 %), whereas the accepted <b>graft</b> <b>body</b> weight ratio was 0. 8 (0. 6 - 1. 2).

Patients and methods: This prospective study included 25 eyes of 25 patients {{with a mean age}} of 40 ± 10 years, who underwent the pterygium excision with conjunctival autograft derived from the body of the pterygium and attached using fibrin glue. The mean follow-up period was 6 months. On all postoperative visits, changes in uncorrected visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, astigmatism, complications, and the evidence of recurrence were recorded. Results: At the end of mean follow-up, uncorrected visual acuity and corrected distance visual acuity improved by one or two lines in all eyes treated. Mean astigmatism reduced significantly from a preoperative value from 2. 308 D to 1. 248 D postoperatively (P< 0. 026). Minor postoperative complications such as congestion, chemosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhage were seen, which resolved with time. No major sight-threatening or graft-related complications were detected. There was no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 6 months. Conclusion: Self-conjunctival autograft following the pterygium excision appears to be a feasible, safe, and effective alternative method for management of pterygium. It also preserves the superior conjunctiva for future surgeries. However, longer follow-up is required to study the long-term outcomes, especially the incidence of recurrence.
