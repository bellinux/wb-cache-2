25|$|Meanwhile, Zamfir Arbore was {{progressively}} {{integrated into}} the Romanian civil service: a clerk at the State Archives, he became a statistician in service to the Bucharest City Hall (from 1896 to 1920). As a socialist activist, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> support the faction of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Constantin Mille, who published Lumea Nouă review and ultimately set up the short-lived Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR).|$|E
500|$|The {{first time}} Sarmiento {{was forced to}} leave home was with his uncle, José de Oro, in 1827, because of his {{military}} activities. José de Oro was a priest who had fought in the Battle of Chacabuco under General San Martín. Together, Sarmiento and de Oro went to San Francisco del Monte, in the neighbour province of San Luis. He spent much of his time with his uncle learning and began to teach at the only school in town. [...] Later that year, his mother wrote to him asking him to come home. Sarmiento refused, only to receive a response from his father that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> collect him. His father had persuaded the governor of San Juan to send Sarmiento to Buenos Aires to study at the College of Moral Sciences (Colegio de Ciencias Morales).|$|E
500|$|According to Chapter 49 of the De administrando imperio of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), in {{the reign}} of Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) the Slavs of the Peloponnese made war on the Greek {{population}} {{with the aid of}} [...] "African Saracens", looted the countryside and laid siege to Patras. The city held out for a while, but as food began growing short, the inhabitants gave thought to surrendering. First, however, they dispatched a rider to the direction of Corinth, the seat of the military governor (strategos), to find out whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> their aid or not. The envoy had been instructed on his return to give a signal through a flag he carried: if help was on its way, he was to dip the flag, otherwise to hold it erect. The rider found out that the strategos was not coming or was delayed—Constantine VII writes that he arrived three days after the siege had ended—but on his return to the city, his horse slipped and both he and the flag fell down. The inhabitants of Patras interpreted this as a sign that aid was near, and sallied forth against the besieging Slavs, allegedly led by the city's patron Saint Andrew himself on horseback. The Slavs panicked at the sudden assault and fled, abandoning the siege. As a punishment, Constantine VII records that the Slavs were thereafter obligated to maintain at their own cost all officials or envoys passing through Patras, relieving the local see of this burden.|$|E

2500|$|He {{spent time}} {{taking care of}} his younger brother and sister until his move back to his mother's home in San Diego, California, in July 2003, in a period when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> terms with his sexuality. While at his mother's home, then aged 16, he spent his {{weekends}} in Los Angeles with his first boyfriend, who was older than him. His older boyfriend introduced him to a [...] "fast, furious, out-of-control side to the gay scene", with which he was not comfortable.|$|E
