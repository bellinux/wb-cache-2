5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E

25|$|The {{linguistic}} term Cumbric {{is defined}} according to geographical rather than linguistic criteria: that is, {{it refers to}} the variety of Brittonic spoken within a particular region of North Britain and implies nothing about that variety <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> geographically distinct from other varieties. This has led to a discussion about the nature of Cumbric and its relationship with other Brittonic languages, in particular with Old Welsh.|$|E

25|$|Two more {{variants}} of the Supermarine Attacker were {{built for the}} FAA. The FB 1 was a fighter-bomber which differed little from the F 1 <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> expected to operate as a ground attack aircraft. The third, and last, variant of the Attacker was the FB 2 which introduced a new Rolls-Royce Nene engine and modifications to its structure. The Supermarine Attacker now had eight underwing pylons which could carry two 1,000lb (454kg) bombs or eight unguided rockets.|$|E
25|$|The first SS Talune was a {{passenger}} and freight steamship {{employed in the}} Tasman Sea and South Seas trades {{in the last decade}} of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century.

25|$|The central {{position}} and military {{security of the}} city naturally tended to raise it to a commanding position among the Boeotians, and from early days its inhabitants endeavoured to establish a complete supremacy over their kinsmen in the outlying towns. This centralizing policy is as much the cardinal fact of Theban history as the counteracting effort of the smaller towns to resist absorption forms the main chapter {{of the story of}} Boeotia. No details of the earlier history of Thebes have been preserved, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> governed by a land-holding aristocracy who safeguarded their integrity by rigid statutes about the ownership of property and its transmission over time.|$|E
25|$|Constantinople {{was founded}} by the Roman Emperor Constantine I (272–337 AD) in 324 {{on the site of}} an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled {{in the early days of}} Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the {{city-state}} of Megara. This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories, Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> abandoned by the time the Megarian colonists settled the site anew. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC, across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} of the dorms for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives was actually an apartment complex in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow {{that can be seen}} outside the dorms was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the film's Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter came to the opinion that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joe's apartment was another set and was exactly like the real apartment <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment. Additional filming was done in Coquitlam, another Vancouver suburb, at Riverview Hospital's Unit 8 building.|$|E

500|$|On 27 April 2007, a new search {{involving}} {{some twenty}} investigators was launched at Van der Sloot's parents' home on Aruba. Dutch authorities searched {{the yard and}} surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office, Vivian van der Biezen, stated [...] "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications". A statement released directly from the prosecutor's office stated: [...] "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search." [...] Investigators did not comment on what prompted the new search, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not related to Van der Sloot's book.|$|E
500|$|During the year-long {{siege of}} Rome by the Goths, Bessas {{commanded}} the troops at the Porta Praenestina gate and distinguished {{himself in a}} number of skirmishes. Nothing is known of his role in the subsequent events until 540, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably at about this time that he was raised to the rank of patricius. In early 538, Bessas had protected Belisarius when the general Constantine tried to kill him during a dispute, but by 540, when Belisarius was preparing to enter Ravenna under pretense of accepting the Gothic offer to become Emperor of the West, he clearly felt that Bessas could not be trusted, and sent him, along with other troublemaking generals such as John and Narses, to occupy remote locations in Italy.|$|E
500|$|After {{she left}} de Bruin late in 1971, Dworkin said, her ex-husband attacked, persecuted, and harassed her, beating her and {{threatening}} her whenever he found {{where she was}} hiding. She found herself desperate for money, often homeless, {{thousands of miles from}} her family, later remarking that [...] "I often lived the life of a fugitive, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the more desperate life of a battered woman who had run away for the last time, whatever the outcome". Dworkin worked as a prostitute for a period. Ricki Abrams, a feminist and fellow expatriate, sheltered Dworkin in her home, and helped her find places to stay on houseboats, a communal farm, and deserted buildings. Dworkin tried to work up the money to return to the United States.|$|E

The open long ray is like the real line (or {{equivalently}} an open half-line) <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much longer in one direction: we say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long at one end and short (open) at the other. The long line is longer than the real lines in both directions: we say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long in both directions.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the first}} games to offer an {{interactive}} camera system was Super Mario 64. The game had two types of camera systems between which the player could switch at any time. The first one was a standard tracking camera system <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> partly driven by artificial intelligence. Indeed, the system was [...] "aware" [...] {{of the structure of}} the level and therefore could anticipate certain shots. For example, in the first level, when the path to the hill is about to turn left, the camera automatically starts looking towards the left too, thus anticipating the player's movements. The second type allows the player to control the camera relatively to Mario's position. By pressing on the left or right buttons, the camera rotates around Mario, while pressing up or down moves the camera closer or away from Mario.|$|E
500|$|On April 27, 2007, a new search {{involving}} approximately 20 investigators {{was launched}} at the Van der Sloot family residence in Aruba. Dutch authorities searched {{the yard and}} surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt. Prosecution spokeswoman Van der Biezen stated, [...] "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications." [...] A statement from the prosecutor's office related, [...] "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search." [...] Investigators did not comment on what prompted the new search, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not related to Van der Sloot's book. According to Paulus van der Sloot, [...] "nothing suspicious" [...] was found, and all that was seized were diary entries {{of him and his}} wife, and his personal computer—which was subsequently returned. According to Jossy Mansur, managing editor of Aruba's Diario newspaper, investigators were following up on statements made during early suspect interrogations regarding communications between the Kalpoe brothers and Van der Sloot. He also said investigators could be seen examining a laptop at the house.|$|E
