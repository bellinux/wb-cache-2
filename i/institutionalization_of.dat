40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to discuss the enigma of revolutionary new {{political}} beginnings of constitutional orders. The problem is that when a political community is constituted, the act of constituting per definition is unconstitutional or extra-legal. For this reason the question of new beginnings is a political and not a legal question. The question of what {{the authority of the}} constituent act is presents an important question since the constitution is the fundamental law from which the legitimacy or authority of all other laws is derived. The problem for this paper is whether and in what way it is possible to think new beginnings that are not merely <b>institutionalizations</b> <b>of</b> factual relations of domination or arbitrary acts of violence. This problem is discussed on basis of two revolutionary theories in the tradition of constituent power—Emmanuel Sieyès and Hannah Arendt—that both understand power to emanate from below and not from above whereby they both, though in different way, present arguments against the understanding that new beginnings merely are <b>institutionalizations</b> <b>of</b> relations of domination and arbitrary acts of violence. The question of whether and to what extent they are successful and whether their theories are democratic will finally be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Institutionalization as a 'process theory' moves {{beyond the}} {{specification}} of a dichotomous variable - either an institution exists or {{it does not}} - to a continuous variable - whereby an institution can {{be more or less}} institutionalized.

The essence of the argument presented in this article is that in the study of legislatures both the specification and measurement <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> have been deficient.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{ascertain}} {{the influence of the}} length <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> on older adults' balance and risk of falls. METHOD: to evaluate the risk of falls, the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Get Up and Go test were used; and for measuring postural balance, static stabilometry was used, with acquisition of the elliptical area of 95 % and mean velocities on the x and y axes of center of pressure displacement. Parametric and nonparametric measures of association and comparison (&# 945;< 0. 05) were used. RESULTS: there was no significant correlation between the length <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> and the tests for evaluation of risk of falling, neither was there difference between groups and within subgroups, stratified by length <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> and age. In the stabilometric measurements, there was a negative correlation between the parameters analyzed and the length <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization,</b> and difference between groups and within subgroups. CONCLUSION: this study's results point to the difficulty of undertaking postural control tasks, showing a leveling below the clinical tests' reference scores. In the stabilometric behavior, one should note the reduction of the parameters as the length <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> increases, contradicting the assumptions. This study's results offer support {{for the development of a}} multi-professional model for intervention with the postural control and balance of older adults living in homes for the aged...|$|R

The aim is to estimate prediction models for long-term AD progression and subsequently economic outcomes. METHODS: Three-year follow-up data on 435 patients treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in clinical practise were analyzed. Regression models were estimated for long-term prediction of decline in cognitive function (ADAS-cog) and activities in daily living (ADL) ability, risk <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> and costs <b>of</b> care. RESULTS: The cognitive deterioration was estimated at between 1. 6 and 4 ADAS-cog points per every 6 months, increasing with disease severity. Cognitive function was an important predictor of ADL-ability, which itself {{was the most important}} predictor of the risk <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> and costs <b>of</b> care.

Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a de facto system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black.

The information systems category included two boundary objects: an easily accessible DMIS prototype and an online portal for project management. The selective <b>institutionalizations</b> <b>of</b> these key boundary objects helped the participants to overcome various contradictions existed in the socio-technical system of collaborative cross-border disaster management. Specifically, the uncertainty about the collaboration project’s future (i.e., lifespan), the limited information sharing capability in the DM community, and the wide geographic and functional dispersions of the collaboration partners were alleviated by the key boundary objects.|$|R

Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of {{the party in power}} to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{the public}} {{expenditure}} on long-term care {{is likely to}} increase with the ageing of the population, identifying chronic medical conditions associated with the risk of long-term institutiona-lization is of particular interest. However, there is little systematic evidence showing how chronic medical conditions, other than dementia, affect the risk of entering into institutional care in the general older population. Methods: We used population-based follow-up data on Finnish older people aged 65 and over (n 280 722), to estimate the impact of different chronic conditions on the risk <b>of</b> long-term <b>institutionalization.</b> Furthermore, we analysed which chronic conditions were more strongly associated with the risk <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> than with the risk <b>of</b> death without <b>institutionalization.</b> Cox proportional hazard regression models were used. Results: Our results showed that dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, depressive symptoms, other mental health problems, hip fracture and diabetes were strongly associated with increased risk <b>of</b> long-term <b>institutionalization,</b> independent <b>of</b> socio-demographic confounders and the presence of other chronic conditions. All these conditions raised the risk <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> by 50 % or more.

Design. Quasi-experimental design. Setting. Six general hospitals in Belgium. Participants. A representative sample of 824 patients, 355 of whom {{were assigned to the}} experimental group receiving comprehensive discharge management and 469 to the control group receiving usual care. Inclusion criteria were patients admitted to a geriatric, rehabilitation, or internal medicine ward, not residing in a nursing home, and showing risk <b>of</b> readmission or <b>institutionalization</b> on admission in the hospital. Intervention. In-hospital discharge planning according to a case management protocol allowing for adjustment to participating hospitals' case mix and patients' and families' specific needs. Main outcome measures. Hospital readmission within 15 and 90 days post discharge; institutionalization at discharge and within 15 and 90 days post discharge. Results. Discharge management resulted in fewer institutionalizations (n = 53; 14. 9 %) compared with usual care (n = 130; 23. 7 %) (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 47; CI 95 % = 0. 31 - 0. 70).
