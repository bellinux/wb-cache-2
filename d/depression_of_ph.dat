40|$|Ferric {{sulphate}} dosing {{has been}} used as a eutrophication control measure in water supply reservoirs. The dosing results in precipitation of available phosphorus to a layer overlying the natural sediments. Stream sites contaminated with iron from mine drainage exhibit impoverished fish and benthic invertebrate communities. This study investigated the potential impact of prolonged exposure to sedimented iron precipitates on chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae), as representative of benthic invertebrates.;The distribution of chironomid taxa in relation to ferric dosing at Rutland Water, Leicestershire has been examined. Areas of impoverished chironomid communities coincided with areas having increased sediment iron levels. Procladius (Tanypodinae) and the tribe Tanytarsini, dominant elsewhere in the reservoir, were largely absent from these areas.;A laboratory investigation of the effects of sedimented ferric precipitates on Chironomus riparius (Meigen) has been performed. This species is easily cultured and as a non-selective benthic detritivore was a suitable test organism. Simple static-with-replacement tests of various duration were used due to the flocculant nature of the precipitates and to avoid loss of small early instar larvea.;Precipitation of iron was rapid and virtually complete after addition of ferric sulphate to filtered reservoir water. High larval mortality resulted from initial, temporary, <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> due to addition. <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> is unlikely to be a major problem in a large well-buffered reservoir. Retardation of larval growth and development, and delayed adult emergence were related to increasing target iron concentration. Iron uptake was dominated by precipitate ingestion and little iron was internally absorbed. Reduced energy intake over time due to dilution of food by ingested precipitates is suggested to be the main mode of action. This may be a factor of the reduced chironomid diversity at iron-contaminated field sites...|$|E

These strains included one hundred and thirty-three strains of identified yeast,i. e., forty-four strains of Pichia, fifty-four strains of Hansenula, six strains of Saccharomyces, ten strains of Candida, three strains of Mycotorula,five strains of Rhodotorula and eleven strains of Debaryomyces,and one hundred and twenty-four strains of unidentified yeast isolated in our laboratory. Seven strains of yeast, Mycotorula japonica 316, Mycotorula japonica 6226, Mycotorula japonica 6229, Candida tropicalis 6019, Candida tropicalis 6263, Candida tropicalis 6264 and unidentified strain Y 191, utilizing hydrocarbon as carbon source were selected. Among these seven strains of yeast, Mycotorula japonica 316 and Y 191 strain, which had been isolated from oily soil by M. Akaki (one of the authors), grew abundantly, especially in the medium containig cetane as carbon source. When ammonium sulphate was used as nitrogen source, the pH of culture media depressed extremely during cultivation. In the culture with media, which used urea instead of ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source, these yeast cultures were prevented from <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> during cultivation, and gave high yield of the yeast cell, particularly Y 191 strain. Since Y 191 strain is capable of utilizing various hydrocarbon source and making rapid growth in the media containig hydrocarbon, {{it would seem to}} be a promising strain for cell production from hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Water {{is a major}} expense when air-freighting live fish. However, {{reducing}} the volume of water relative {{to the amount of}} product usually results in more rapid water quality deterioration and higher mortality due to the higher concentration of excretory products in closed transport systems. The major water quality effects experienced by fish during transport are: low dissolved oxygen levels due to oxygen consumption by respiration; accumulation of carbon dioxide from respiration; <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> caused by carbon dioxide accumulation; and increased ammonia levels resulting from ammonia excretion. The physiological responses of seawater-adapted barramundi, Lates calcarifer, were studied during simulated live transport and transport under circumstances of elevated CO 2 or NH 3. Blood samples were removed from fish exposed to these treatments and compared to samples from control fish, (free in the tank) and fish confined in a box but with free-flowing seawater. Analysing the blood samples showed that simulated transport caused the plasma pH of the fish to fall, threatening the blood's ability to transport oxygen, but the red blood cells apparently defended their internal pH and oxygen transport capacity, and swelled measurably as a result. Exposing fish to unusually high carbon dioxide or ammonia levels caused plasma pH to fall to near lethal levels. The effects of both carbon dioxide and ammonia need to be considered when studying the responses of barramundi to live transport. Water quality parameters during fish transport do not act in isolation. Attempts to reduce carbon dioxide accumulation, for example, by using a buffer to control the water pH, may influence the fish's ability to excrete ammonia. ...|$|E

Our previous study showed that <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> using lactic acid treatment stimulated the efflux of ATP from skeletal myocytes through a mechanism that involved the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The present study was undertaken to further explore the signal transduction mechanism linking the decrease in pH to the ATP release from muscle. Accumulation of ATP in the medium surrounding the myocytes was measured using a luminescence assay. Incubation of the myocytes in lactic acid (10 mM) for 3 hours increased the extracellular ATP from 0. 67 ± 0. 08 to 1. 15 ± 0. 11 nM (n= 36; P< 0. 001). The specific inhibitor of CFTR, CFTRinh- 172, inhibited the lactic-acid-induced increase in extracellular ATP. The CFTR expression was significantly increased with 3 hours incubation with lactic acid. Lactic acid treatment also increased the intracellular cAMP from 3. 2 ± 0. 3 to 7. 1 ± 1. 0 nM, and the Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity from 30. 6 ± 4. 5 to 37. 0 ± 5. 4 pmol/ml, whereas the lactic-acid-induced increase in extracellular ATP was inhibited by the PKA inhibitor, KT 5720, but enhanced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, suggesting that the PKA/cAMP pathway was involved in CFTR activation. Furthermore, an in vivo phosphorylation study using 32 P-ATP showed that CFTR phosphorylation was increased by forskolin alone or foskolin with dibutyryl-cAMP and IBMX, further supporting a role for the cAMP/PKA pathway in CFTR activation in muscle. Amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na/H exchanger (NHE), prevented the lactic-acid-induced increases in intracellular cAMP and extracellular ATP; inhibitors of the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX), SN- 6 and KB-R 7943, also inhibited the lactic-acid-induced accumulation of ATP in the medium surrounding the cultured myocytes. Based on these data, we propose that depression of the pH increases the efflux of ATP through a mechanism that involves CFTR activation through the cAMP/PKA pathway, and that NHE and NCX may be involved. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Session - Purines: Release and MetabolismIn-vivo {{studies showed}} that {{adenosine}} output increased with the <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> during either muscle contractions or acid infusion. However, the effect of pH elevation on adenosine output has never been reported. Several enzymes {{may be involved in}} the adenosine production from AMP, namely 5 ’-nucleotidase and the non-specific phosphatases, including alkaline phosphatase. The contribution of these enzymes to the adenosine production may vary at different pH values. We tested the effect of depression or elevation of pH on the adenosine output from rat gracilis muscle. The vascularly-isolated muscle was perfused in-situ at a constant flow rate of 40 - 50 pl/min/g. The pH of the perfusion buffer (Kreb’s-bicarbonate equilibrated against 95 % 02 / 5 % COZ, 37 °C) was either depressed to 6. 8 or elevated to 7. 8 by substituting 30 mM sodium chloride with a similar concentration of sodium acetate or ammonium chloride, respectively. The vascularly isolated muscle was stretched to its resting length (1,) and perfused via a muscular branch of the femoral artery with buffer at pH 7. 4 (control) and thereafter with buffer either at pH 6. 8 (acidosis) or at pH 7. 8 (alkalosis). Samples of venous effluent collected during both control and acidosis or alkalosis were purified by organic extraction and their adenosine concentrations were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Acidosis increased the venous adenosine concentration from 784 + 167 to 1170 + 263 nM (n= 6; PcO. 02 Student’s t-test); however, alkalosis did not significantly alter the venous adenosine (595 f 3 18 nM in control and 763 + 191 nM in alkalosis). Adenosine formation by 5 ’-nucleotidase increases at low pH, which may account for the enhanced adenosine production in acidosis. At elevated pH the adenosine formation by 5 ’- nucleotidase decreases, whereas the formation by alkaline phosphatase increases. These data suggest that the overall rate of adenosine production does not change with moderate elevation of pH. We speculate that the relative contributions of 5 ’-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase to the adenosine production may change as the pH increases...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-In 5 {{different}} types of rat tumors, the pH of the interstitial Ruid ranged from 7. 193 to 6. 948, the CO 2 tension from 59 to 84 mm Hg, the dissolved C 02 from 2. 0 to 2. 6 mM per liter, and the concentration of bi-carbonate from 18. 6 to 24. 3 mM per liter. Compared with the plasma of blood afferent to the tumor, the pH of the tumor interstitial Ruid was 0. 2 to 0. 4 units lower, the pC 02 16 to 39 mm Hg higher, the dissolved C 02 about 1 mM per liter higher, and the concentration of bicarbonate 4 to 6 mM per liter lower. The same differences were observed when the tumor interstitial Ruid was compared with the interstitial Ruid of the normal subcutaneous area, though the differences were slightly less when the comparison was made with the plasma of the efferent blood of the tumor or with the lymph of the thoracic duct of the host. A change in the acid-base status of the interstitial Ruid of the tumor was produced either by an increase of the C 02 concentration in the air inhaled by the host or by in-gestion of sodium bicarbonate or ammonium chloride. When a <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> was produced in the blood plasma, a depression roughly equal {{was found in the}} interstitial fluid of the tumor. As the pH of this fluid is normally quite low, exceptionally low pH values (6. 6 - 6. 7) could be induced ex-clusively in the tumor. The C 02 tension increased in the tumor to levels twice as high as that in plasma or in the other body fluids of the host, and values of more than 200 mm Hg were reached in the interstitial fluid of the tumor. The amount of dissolved C 02 changed proportionally while the concentration of the bicarbonate showed less drastic oscillations. A peculiarity of NaHCOa was that it acted as an acidifying agent exclusively in the interstitial Ruid of the tumor. Profound changes were produced in the milieu of the tumor, though in the other Ruids of the host the parameters of the acid-base equilibrium remained at a level that was physiologicall...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the factors affecting the H+-K+ exchange catalyzed by rat liver mitochondria depleted of endogenous Mg 2 + by treatment with the ionophore A 23187. The exchange has been monitored as {{the rate of}} K+ efflux following addition of A 23187 in low-K+ media. (1) The H+-K+ exchange is abolished by uncouplers and respiratory inhibitors. The inhibition {{is not related to}} the <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> delta <b>pH,</b> whereas a dependence is found on the magnitude of the transmembrane electrical potential, delta psi. Maximal rate of K+ efflux is observed at 180 - 190 mV, whereas K+ efflux is inhibited below 140 - 150 mV. (2) Activation of H+-K+ exchange leads to <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> delta <b>pH</b> but not <b>of</b> delta psi. Respiration is only slightly stimulated by the onset of H+-K+ exchange in the absence of valinomycin. These findings indicate that the exchange is electroneutral, and that the delta psi control presumably involves conformational changes of the carrier. (3) Incubation in hypotonic media at pH 7. 4 or in isotonic media at alkaline pH results in a marked activation of the rate of H+-K+ exchange, while leaving unaffected the level of Mg 2 + depletion. This type of activation results in partial 'uncoupling' from the delta psi control, suggesting that membrane stretching and alkaline pH induce conformational changes on the exchange carrier equivalent to those induced by high delta psi.

In response to the volcanic activity, the U. S.

Streams to the east of Mount St. Helens received the major ash fallout. Chemical effects were best noted in smaller streams sampled 60 to 70 miles northeast of Mount St. Helens. The chemical variations observed were pronounced but short lived. Sulfate and chloride increases in anionic composition were prevalent immediately following the eruption; however, the original bicarbonate predominance was again attained within several days. Suspended iron and aluminum concentrations were similarly elevated during the period of greatest ash deposition (highest turbidity); however, the dissolved concentrations remained relatively constant. <b>Depressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pH</b> were minor and short lived.

The MIC for conidia and, to a lesser extent, mycelia was shown to be dependent on the inoculum size. A. niger is capable of degrading sorbic acid, and this ability has consequences for food preservation strategies.

The current use of concanavalin A, the phytohemagglutinin of the jack bean ~, as a probe for investigating membranous glycoproteins and glycolipids requires a detailed knowledge of the protein's pecificity. Extensive hapten inhibition studies employing mono- and oligosaccharides and their simple derivatives demonstrated that the concanavalin A combining sites are complimentary to ct-D-mannopyranosyl and a-D-glucopyranosyl (or its 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy derivative) residues with a specific requirement that the hydroxyl groups at the C- 3, 4 and 6 positions of these sugars be unmodified 2 -s. In a recent communication 6 it was reported that glucuronic acid is a better inhibitor than D-glucose of concanavalin A-polysaccharide interaction.

While estimating the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> students during pre-diploma and post-diploma studies, cohort analysis of the matriculates <b>of</b> Faculty <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> <b>of</b> KUM was carried out. The requirement for PH specialists was evaluated by carrying out the Delphi survey. Results. In 1993 - 2002 the number <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> specialists per 10 thousand population decreased in Lithuania: mostly the number <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> specialists with non-university medical education. In 1994 - 2000 84. 9 percent of 272 matriculates graduated from Faculty <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> <b>of</b> KUM. 2. 5 percent of students graduated earlier than after 4 years, because they had moved from Faculty of Medicine to the third or the fourth course <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> studies. The {{number of students who}} left for other faculties was 2. 9 percent. It was impossible to find out the outcome of studies of 1. 5 percent of students. Totally, 10. 7 percent of students have not graduated from the university. In 1998 - 2001 94. 4 percent of 179 matriculates graduated from postgraduate studies in Faculty <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> <b>of</b> KUM. It was impossible to find out the outcome of studies of 1. 7 percent of students. Totally, 3. 9 percent of students did not graduate. According to the results the Delphi survey, the requirement for PH specialists is 5. 8 per 10 thousand population until 2015. Conclusions. 1. Geographic maldistribution <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> specialists was observed in Lithuania in 1993 - 2002. During this period the number <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> specialists per 10 thousand population decreased. 2. Every tenth student dropped out from pre-diploma studies at the Faculty <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> <b>of</b> KUM in 1994 - 2000. 3. Almost four (3. 9) percent of students dropped out from postgraduate studies at the Faculty <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> <b>of</b> KUM in 1998 - 2001. 4. The requirement for PH specialists by 2015 is 5. 8 per 10 thousand population...|$|R
40|$|Pain {{is often}} {{associated}} with <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> behavior and mood, and relief <b>of</b> pain-related <b>depression</b> is a common goal of treatment. This goal of this dissertation was to conduct preclinical research experiments designed to address a set of three inter-related aims that examine the expression, mechanisms and treatment <b>of</b> pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> Intracranial Self-Stimulation (ICSS) in rats. First, studies evaluated the hypothesis that acute acid-induced <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS was mediated by a kappa opioid receptor mediated decrease in mesolimbic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Results support a role for depressed mesolimbic dopamine release in pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS; however, a role for kappa opioid receptors is not supported. Second, studies evaluated the effectiveness of a more sustained inflammatory noxious stimulus (intraplantar CFA) and a sustained neuropathic stimulus (intraplantar formalin) to produce a long-term pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, and the role of kappa opioid receptors in mediating this sustained pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS. Results indicated that only the neuropathic stimulus (formalin) was sufficient to produce sustained <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, and as in the initial studies, our data did not support a role for kappa receptors in mediating this effect. Given the poor effectiveness of a kappa receptor antagonist to block acute or chronic pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, the final set of studies evaluated the pharmacology of representative drugs from five different classes of established or candidate analgesics (mu opioid agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoamine uptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, and cannabinoid agonists) to reverse the sustained <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS produced by formalin as a neuropathic stimulus. Results demonstrate the mu agonist morphine, the monoamine uptake inhibitor bupropion, the anticonvulsant gabapentin, and the cannabinoid agonist THC were able to reverse formalin-induced mechanical allodynia as a pain-stimulated behavior, but only the mu agonist morphine and the monoamine uptake inhibitor bupropion were effective to reverse formalin-induced <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS. These results provided additional evidence for dissociable drug effects in preclinical assays of pain-stimulated and pain-depressed behavior and also support further studies with monoamine uptake inhibitors with a dopaminergic component (like bupropion) for treatment of neuropathic pain...|$|R

40|$|Early {{injury to}} the lung {{circulation}} leads to the rapid development <b>of</b> pulmonary hypertension (<b>PH)</b> after pre mature birth. PH in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) results from increased vascular tone and abnormal vasoreactivity, hypertensive remodeling, and decreased vascular growth. The development <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> is sometimes a serious complication of BPD that can significantly impact the morbidity and mortality rates of preterm infants. Despite a gradual reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure postnatally, approximately a quarter of BPD infants have echocardiographic evidence <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> later. The pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> in BPD is very complex and multifactorial, often resulting from interactions between genetic and environmental or acquired factors (both prenatal and postnatal). Antenatal risk factors such as intrauterine growth retardation, maternal preeclampsia, and oligohydramnios suggest compelling evidence for the fetal origins <b>of</b> <b>PH.</b> Despite the potential importance <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> in preterm infants, the pathophysiology and the risk factors <b>of</b> <b>PH</b> in infants with BPD are still poorly understood.

40|$|Inbreeding <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> {{an aspect}} of fitness is {{observed}} in many insects, but the traits that are of importance for inbreeding <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> fitness remain poorly understood. Here the magnitude <b>of</b> inbreeding <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> fitness-related traits {{in the development and}} adult stages was measured in a captive population of the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Beetles produced by full-sib matings had 8 % lower survival in the development stage than did beetles produced by unrelated matings. Although inbred and outbred offspring did not differ in body size after emergence, inbred offspring took 2 - 3 % longer to develop to emergence. This indicates inbreeding <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> growth rate. At the adult stage, inbreeding had no significant effect on longevity, however lifetime offspring production was reduced by 11 %. Thus, the magnitude <b>of</b> inbreeding <b>depression</b> was relatively large for offspring production. This suggests inbreeding <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> fitness manifests, to a particularly significant extent, in reduced productivity. This study shows the C. chinensis population, which has been in captivity for more than 100 generations, harbors genetic loads...|$|R
