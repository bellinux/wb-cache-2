5|$|The {{infantry}} {{charge was}} preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and <b>defective</b> <b>equipment</b> doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.|$|E

He drew from Chamberlain the {{admission}} that whilst troops had been held in readiness to be sent to Norway, no troopships had been retained to send them in. Sinclair gave instances of inadequate and <b>defective</b> <b>equipment</b> and of disorganisation reported to him by servicemen returning from Norway. [...] Chamberlain had suggested that Allied plans had failed because the Norwegians had not put up the expected resistance to the Germans. However, Sinclair reported that the servicemen [...] "paid a high tribute to the courage and determination with which the Norwegians fought alongside them. They paid a particular tribute to the Norwegian ski patrols. Norwegians at Lillehammer for seven days held up with rifles only a German force with tanks, armoured cars, bombing aeroplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{condition}} monitoring (CM) {{for the gas}} insulated switchgear (GIS) requires an accurate and reliable identification of the <b>defective</b> <b>equipments</b> in it for maintenance purposes. In this paper, a feature extraction procedure is explored, {{which is based on}} the power spectra density (PSD) of the de-noised partial discharges (PDs) emanating from the <b>defective</b> <b>equipments</b> in GIS. Furthermore, artificial intelligence techniques, in particular, the self organizing map (SOM) are investigated for the role as classifier to precisely identify these <b>defective</b> <b>equipments,</b> based on the PSD feature patterns. The performance of the SOM based classifier is ascertained by using the PDs acquired from practical GISs on South Korean 154 kV EHV transmission networks...|$|R
40|$|A {{condition}} monitoring (CM) system, which integrates wavelet analysis and artificial intelligent techniques {{to analyze the}} partial discharges (PD) patterns and classify the <b>defective</b> <b>equipments</b> in gas insulated switchgear (GIS), is presented here. The multi-resolution signal decomposition (MSD) attribute of the wavelet transform is employed to de-noise the PD signals measured on site, due to its spectrum decomposition capability. The performance of several well tried wavelets are investigated {{in the case of}} denoising, and this demonstrates that the combined use of the Biorthogonal and Daubechies type of wavelets achieves good de-noising results compared to other wavelet families. Different feature extraction methods are applied to the de-noised PD signals, to form pattern vectors which are further used as the inputs to a neural network based classifier, so as to identify the PD patterns and <b>defective</b> <b>equipments</b> in GIS. Several types of neural networks, both supervised and unsupervised (trained), are then evaluated with regard to their suitability as classifier according to training time and classification accuracy. Finally, the performance of the proposed CM system is ascertained by using a set of PD signals emanating from defects in a circuit breaker (CB), disconnect switch (DS), bus bar (BS) and insulation spacer (SP) in practical GISs in Korean 154 KV high voltage transmission networks...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{principal}} terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a [...] "safe system of work". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for labour legislation, {{as a series of}} Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (<b>Defective</b> <b>Equipment)</b> Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to court. Today the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E

The Power Press Regulations of 1965 required “a trained person to carry out tests and inspections after every tool change and during the first four hours of every shift,” while the Construction (Working Places) Regulations of 1966 “stipulated statutory arrangements for safety on building sites.” The National Insurance Act 1966 introduced more generous provisions {{for the assessment of}} certain types of serious disablement caused by industrial injury. That same year, a Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit Scheme was introduced. The Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 was passed, requiring employers to insure their liability to their employees for personal injury, disease or death sustained in their place of work.

50|$|In audio recording, a DC offset is an {{undesirable}} {{characteristic of}} a recording sound. It occurs in the capturing of sound, before it reaches the recorder, and is normally caused by <b>defective</b> or low-quality <b>equipment.</b> The offset causes {{the center of the}} recording waveform to not be at 0, but at a higher or lower value, for example, +1 or -1. This can cause two main problems. Either the loudest parts of the signal will be clipped prematurely, since the base of the waveform has been moved up, or inaudible low-frequency distortion will occur. Low-frequency distortion may not be audible in the initial recording, but if the waveform is resampled to a compressed or lossy digital format, such as an MP3, those corruptions may become audible.|$|R
