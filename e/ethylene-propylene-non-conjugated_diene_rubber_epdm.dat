40|$|Among short fiber-reinforced composites, {{those with}} rubber {{matrices}} have gained great importance {{due to the}} advantages they have in processing and low cost, coupled with high strength. These composites combine the elastic behavior of rubbers with strength and stiffness of fibers.

The study was pursued to {{explore the influence of}} two dissimilar polyolefin polymers (EOC and EPDM) having different molecular architectures on the state and mode of dispersion of the blend components and their effects with special reference to morphological, thermal and mechanical characteristics. The effects of dynamic crosslinking of the PP/EOC and PP/EPDM have been compared by varying the concentration of crosslinking agent and ratio of blend components. The results suggested that the uncrosslinked and dynamically crosslinked blends of PP/EOC exhibit superior mechanical properties over PP/EPDM blends. From the hystersis experiments it was found that PP/EOC blends also perform better fatigue properties over PP/EPDM based blends. It was demonstrated that, the origin of the improved mechanical properties of EOC based blends is due to the combined effect of the unique molecular architecture with the presence of smaller crystals and better interfacial interaction of EOC phase with PP as supported by the results of thermal and fatigue analyses...|$|R

Two EPDM formulations, containing additives typically employed in <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubbers,</b> were analyzed. Initially, gaseous pyrolysis products from paraffin oil, stearic acid, 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), and 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) were characterized separately, and their main absorptions were identified. Subsequently, the gaseous pyrolysis products of raw, unvulcanized, and vulcanized EPDM formulations were analyzed. The similarities observed in the FT-IR spectra of unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM show that the vulcanization process does {{not interfere with the}} pyrolysis products. The identification of the functional groups of the studied additives was possible in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM samples, without solvent extraction. Results also demonstrate that the PY-G/FT-IR technique can identify additives containing sulfur in concentrations as low as 1. 4 phr (1. 26 %) in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM. However, the method showed some limitation due to overlapping and to similarities of TMTM and TMTD PY-G/FT-IR spectra, which could not be distinguished from each other.

Materials have been irradiated with accelerated electrons with absorbed doses equal to 100 and 150 kGy. The main focus of the research is devoted on deformation (elastic and viscoelastic) properties of polymer materials.

Decrement of elastic modulus and increase of total deformation of unirradiated polymer composites has been observed with increase of the induction B. The effect is reduced by increase of the absorbed dose of electron beam radiation to 150 kGy. The value of E remains almost constant for cross-linked polyethylene, in contrast to the non-irradiated samples, at induction in the range of 0. 5 to 1. 8 T.

Ichazo et al [4] studied the influence of vulcanization agents (sulphur and peroxide) on the rheological behavior of PP/SBS blends (90 / 10), where the rubber phase was statically cured. In this paper, the mechanical and morphological behavior of statically vulcanized PP/SBS 90 / 10 blends with peroxide is studied.

The morphology of NR/EPDM blends was investigated by scanning electron microscopy.

These incompatible blends are characterized by a two-phase morphology, narrow interphase, and poor physical and chemical interactions across the phase boundaries. Therefore. a reactive route was employed to compatibilize these blends by the addition of maleic anhydride grafted ethylene propylene rubber (EPM-g-MA). The blends were prepared in an internal mixer. The morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after preferential extraction of the minor phase. The SEM micrographs were quantitatively analyzed for domain size measurements. The morphology of the blends indicated that the EPDM phase was preferentially dispersed as domains in the continuous Sorona(R) matrix up to 30 % of its concentration. A co-continuous morphology was observed above 30 wt% of EPDM content followed by a phase inversion beyond 60 wt% of EPDM. The influence of EPM-g-MA on the phase morphology of blends was studied quantitatively by SEM. It was found that the addition of EPM-g-MA reduces the domain size of the dispersed phase followed by a leveling off at higher concentrations of the compatibilizer. This is an indication of interfacial saturation. The experimental compatibilization results were compared with theoretical predictions. The conformation of the compatibilizer at the interface was analyzed based on the area occupied by the compatibilizer at the blend interface. Free volume measurements using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) were done to analyze the interaction of blends. In the case of uncompatibilized blends the free volume values tend to increase by the addition of EPDM phase showing high level of incompatibility. Addition of EPM-g-MA to the blends tends to decrease the free volume showing its compatibilizing effect. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The main problems which were experience in this study were the dispersion or agglomeration of the filler and the poor interaction between the matrix and the nanofiller. This study compares processing and properties of different kinds of commercial nanofillers with ethylene propylene <b>diene</b> <b>rubber</b> (<b>EPDM).</b> The fillers used are mainly clay based, but carbon nanotubes and calcium carbonate are also evaluated. The literature review focuses on the elastomer and the fillers used in this study, and the improvements in properties achieved so far. Properties of the rubber, of the nanofillers as well as modifications of the fillers are addressed. In the final part, the mixing process and different mixing techniques of filled rubber are discussed. In the practical part, six different nanofillers were tested in an EPDM matrix. Of these, the most interesting fillers were selected and tested in concentrations from 0, 5 to 7, 5 phr. Finally, one filler was selected for modification in order to investigate if the properties could be further enhanced. Testing of the materials included tensile properties, tear strength, hardness, compression set and bound rubber. In addition, curing behaviour and Mooney viscosity were analyzed. Scanning electron microspore was used to investigate the microstructure of the composites. Within this study, a significant improvement of the property profile of the materials by the addition of nanofillers was not observed. The most probable reason for this is an insufficient dispersion of the fillers, with the consequence that the material lacks the filler–filler and filler–polymer network necessary for a good reinforcing effect. The filler–polymer interactions are poor, despite the modifications used in some materials, which also negatively influences the properties. /Kir 1...|$|R

Homogenous dispersion of the silica particles was observed in all cases, as well as good adhesion be- tween the filler and the matrix. The swelling and gel content results indicated that the number of crosslinks decreased, while the network was still extensive enough to maintain the high gel content. These results indicate that the coupling agent acted as a bridge be- tween the hydrophilic silica and the hydrophobic rubber and enhanced the rubber-silica interactions. This enhanced interaction gave rise to increased thermal stability of the EPDM. The values of the Nielsen model parameters, which gave rise to good agreement with the experimentally determined Young’s modulus values, indicate improved dispersion and reduced size of silica aggregates in the EPDM matrix. Good agreement was found between the storage modulus and Young’s modulus values.

The major properties of EPDM are its outstanding heat, ozone and weather resistance ability. It has a good resistance to polar substances and steam condition too. In automobiles <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> has a common use as seals. This includes door seals, window seals, trunk seals and sometimes hood seals. Frequently these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to the movement of the door versus the car body. This is due to friction between the <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> parts and the mating surfaces. Thus, the contact iteration between the rubber sealing and the indenting object must be known to optimize the performance of rubber sealing. However, it is need less to mention that the behaviour of any viscoelastic material is very difficult to be predicted. In the present work various tribo-characteristics of <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> of different hardness have been evaluated utilizing the available laboratory test facilities in the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Compression tests have been carried out using ‘Instron’ to determine the flow behaviour of <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> of different hardness both in dry as well as under different conditions of lubrication. The flow behaviour like load -vs. - elongation curves, true stress -vs. - elongation curves and true stress -vs. - true strain curves have been drawn from the experimental data. Abrasive wear behaviour has been evaluated using a two-body abrasion tester and the pattern abrasion has been appraised through SEM/EDAX study. Experimental results reveal that the hardness of <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> has significant effect on the flow behaviour and wear characteristics. The hardness, again, depends on the proportion of carbon black (CB) content. Thus it can be stated that the flow behaviour can be governed by controlling the CB concentration in the <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber.</b> Based on the experimental results conclusion has been drawn accordingly. Some of the important tribo-characteristics of EPDM have been highlighted. Light has also been shed on various possible areas of further researches those should be undertaken in the future to come...|$|R
