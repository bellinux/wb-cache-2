This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of the race saw {{a large group of}} around forty riders enter Mantua after over one <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> of racing. After the group broke into five or six smaller groups due to a large crash and in part due issues brought about by heavy fog. A group of seven was first to reach the stage's finish in Bologna, where Bianchi's Vincenzo Borgarello won the sprint to the line. Stage 3 began under heavy cloud coverage. The leading group on the road was reduced as the stage traversed the hillier {{portions}} of the stage. Ernesto Azzini of the Legnano team won the stage after edging out Eberardo Pavesi.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Thelma, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Uring, {{was one of the}} deadliest {{tropical}} cyclones in Philippine history, killing at least 5,081people. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on November1, 1991, several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> north-northeast of Palau, the depression that would become Thelma tracked generally westward. After turning southwestward in response to a cold front, the system intensified into a tropical storm on November4 as it approached the Philippines. Hours before moving over the Visayas, Thelma attained its peak intensity with estimated ten-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph) and a barometric pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Despite moving over land, the system weakened only slightly, emerging over the South China Sea on November6 while retaining gale-force winds. Thelma ultimately succumbed to wind shear and degraded to a tropical depression. On November8, the depression made landfall in Southern Vietnam before dissipating hours later.|$|E

25|$|Other mechanisms, such as melting from a {{meteorite}} impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, {{and the outer}} several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma.

25|$|The north Atlantic is {{characterized}} by strong, large-scale anomalies of the gravity field and the geoid. The geoid rises up to 70 m above the geodetic reference ellipsoid in an approximately circular area with a diameter of several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers.</b> In {{the context of the}} plume hypothesis, this has been explained by the dynamic effect of the upwelling plume which bulges up the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, the plume and the thickened crust cause a positive gravity anomaly of about 60 mGal (=0.0006m/s²) (free-air).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two {{dimensional}} Fourier transform can be {{used for}} the upward continuation of gravity or magnetic field data acquired at given altitude over a rectangular area. Earth’s curvature is often neglected in most potential field continuations, however, it should be considered over several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometer</b> field area. In this study, we developed a new method retaining terms of Earth’s curvature to better perform the continuation of potential field on spherical patch area...|$|R
25|$|Any {{reconstruction}} of mercurian geologic history must include the inference that {{at an early}} time the planet was differentiated into a core and crust. Mercury has a weak magnetic field coupled with high density. Both facts can most easily {{be accounted for by}} the presence of an iron core, possibly liquid, roughly 4,200km in diameter, overlain by a silicate crust a few <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> thick. The postulated volcanic origin of a substantial fraction of the Mercurian plains also implies a thick silicate crust, and thereby supports the existence of a large iron core.|$|E
25|$|One model {{holds that}} very saline brines formed in a {{restricted}} ocean basin within a <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> {{of the site}} of the Red Dog deposits. The brine fluid infiltrated the subsurface and was tectonically pumped through the rock mass, becoming enriched in metals as it stripped those metals from the rocks it passed through. The fluid traveled several kilometers below the earth's surface. The fluid eventually reemerged through fault systems focused on the location of the Red Dog deposits, in a manner somewhat similar to the process surrounding black smokers.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 North Yemen {{earthquake}} hit {{near the}} city of Dhamar, North Yemen (now part of Yemen) on December 13. Measuring 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale, with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, as many as 2,800 people were killed and another 1,500 injured. The shock occurred within several <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> of a plate boundary in a geologically complex region that includes active volcanoes and seafloor spreading ridges. Yemen has a history of destructive earthquakes, though this was the first instrumentally recorded event to be detected on global seismograph networks.|$|E

25|$|The ages of tektites {{from the}} four strewnfields have been {{determined}} using radiometric dating methods. The age of moldavites, a type of tektite found in Czech Republic, {{was determined to be}} 14 million years, which agrees well with the age determined for the Nördlinger Ries crater (a few <b>hundred</b> <b>kilometers</b> away in Germany) by radiometric dating of Suevite (an impact breccia found at the crater). Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the Lake Bosumtwi Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} to the western Bell Beakers groups, and the contemporary cultures of the Carpathian basin to the south east, is much less.

25|$|All low-lying {{areas and}} the areas between craters and basins in the Discovery {{quadrangle}} are covered by broadly level, plains-forming material, except for small areas covered by the hilly and lineated material and hummocky plains material described below.

Strom and others and Trask and Strom cited evidence that many large areas of plains are of volcanic origin. Smaller tracts are more apt to be impact melt, loose debris pooled in low spots by seismic shaking, or ejecta from secondary impacts. The origin of many individual tracts must necessarily remain uncertain without additional information.|$|E
