500|$|The Commitments is {{the first}} book in Doyle's series known as The Barrytown Trilogy, {{followed}} by The Snapper (1990) and The Van (1991). While all three novels focus on the Rabbitte family, Doyle expressed {{that he was not}} interested in writing or producing sequels to the 1991 film adaptation, stating, [...] "I hope it's never made. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> whereas The Commitments was very much a labour of love, Commitments 2 is definitely an act of cynicism." ...|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bucchianeri and U.S. Air Force veteran Ron Mackell Jr. {{ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for the general election; it was therefore possible that Critz could win the special election but lose the primary for the November general election. Hafer had initially planned {{to run for the}} Democratic nomination in the general election, but withdrew on March 10, 2010, saying [...] "He won both nominations, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's time for me to step aside and let him go forward. There's no sense in me beating him up." ...|$|E
500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> gross." [...] On being a young role model to kids, Song said: [...] "Oh goodness, I hope I can set a good example. If I can do it, anyone can. I'm living my dream every single day." ...|$|R
500|$|The spacewalk was {{completed}} in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS passed the initial aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble servicing spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. During the previous day's mission status briefing, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made a prediction, joking that since the first two spacewalks, which {{were considered to be}} straightforward, had run into issues, the most difficult EVA – to repair the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. [...] "I have a prediction, We've always said EVA 3 {{was going to be the}} most difficult and the most challenging, and I predict it's going to go more smoothly than any other EVA on this mission. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> some version of Murphy's Law that's going to lead us in that direction." ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

50|$|Katt Shea {{worked on}} the {{original}} story. She later recalled: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't get paid for it. It was weird. Basically my script from Stripped to Kill was re-worked and re-used by Roger Corman and a very bad movie {{was the result of}} that. That’s my opinion and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> film was well done. I don’t like that Roger Corman does that. I love Roger, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn’t like that.|$|R
3000|$|... “All {{we do is}} bring {{industry}} {{partners who}} we have served and we put {{them in front of}} a bunch of politicians, both provincial and federal, and they tell their stories. That’s a way to get industry involved, but absolutely {{there is no way that}} you could say that the private sector is putting a lot of time and energy into influencing or improving innovation research policy in Canada. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> true.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Gigwise when asked what influence The Holy Bible had on Futurology, frontman and singer James Dean Bradfield replied: [...] "That we could still trade in a language that is still exclusively ours, that we could still want to write songs that other people are just never going to go near. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> anyone else would go near that subject matter. We never laid claim to being the most 'original' band, but I think we're unique in that sense." ...|$|R
5000|$|Everybody is free {{to believe}} {{anything}} he wants to; <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Dave misunderstood the whole subject. I have met the guys from Rotting Christ and I don't {{think that they are}} Satanists or something. I think that Dave overreacted on this.|$|E
5000|$|Ed Lover {{spoke to}} the New York Times about the falling out: [...] "Tupac made disparaging remarks about him in VIBE Magazine and it really hurt his {{feelings}} a lot. I think - just my opinion - after Tupac got shot, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Tupac just kind of turned against everybody." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding his career, he said, [...] "...but {{as far as}} {{design is}} concerned, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Ive {{happened}} to fall into a little sweet spot where I {{get a lot of}} freedom, but I guess the cost is my livelihood." [...] He further said working in the gaming industry is [...] "soul crushing".|$|E
50|$|It was strange. A lot {{of changes}} would happen after I turned in a script. Quite often, my idea {{of what to do}} with the Dove was have him do brave stuff - and then it would be changed by either Dick Giordano or Steve into the Hawk doing that stuff. They’d say it was out of {{character}} for the Dove. They seemed to be equating Dove with wimp, wuss, coward or whatever. And I don’t really think it was because they were more hawkish. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they knew what a dove was.|$|R
5000|$|Infidels closer, [...] "Dont Fall Apart On Me Tonight" [...] {{stands out}} on the album as a pure love song. On past albums like John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, Dylan closed with love songs sung to the narrators partner, and that {{tradition}} is continued with [...] "Dont Fall Apart On Me Tonight", with a chorus that asks [...] "Dont fall apart on me tonight, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> dont <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could handle it./Dont fall apart on me tonight, Yesterdays just a memory, Tomorrow is never what its supposed to be/And I need you, yeah, you tonight." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Vanity Fair, Lawrence called the leak a [...] "sex crime" [...] and a [...] "sexual violation" [...] and added, [...] "anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame". This view was contrasted by another victim of the hack, Emily Ratajkowski, who told GQ, [...] "A {{lot of people who}} were victims of hack said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> fair", and [...] "I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal. I think the people who stole the photos are".|$|R
5000|$|I {{think that}} he {{committed}} suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain {{a lot of things}} around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|E
50|$|But, I {{think that}} there are people who can handle it, and I think that for the people who can handle it, it's OK. I don't think there's {{anything}} wrong with it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> um, when it comes to the point where the pain of using the things are too great than the pain of not using them, then you have to stop.|$|E
5000|$|Gillanders {{believes}} that the environment and industrial expansion can coexist in Spencer Gulf. In 2011 she commented: [...] "I used {{to think it was}} either the environment or industrial development, that you couldn't have both... but I think we've moved beyond that now, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we can mesh both together such that we get positive outcomes for both the environment and the industry." ...|$|E

5000|$|Levin {{met with}} President Donald Trump on March 7 in the Oval Office and chatted {{for an hour}} [...] Levin [...] "just really likes {{powerful}} people, and he really likes having friends who are powerful, and who better than the President of the United States? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he’s <b>just</b> blinded {{by the fact that}} the President calls him on the phone. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that’s</b> really cool,” a former staffer told ThinkProgress.|$|R

5000|$|It's hard {{to break}} the {{patterns}} in my workspace, where the TV presenters need to be direct, and neutral in some topics. It surprises me when people say we are opinion leaders, but actually we the opinion leaders can't say anything but sillinesses, unrelated to deeper issues which interest the country. I have not rebelled, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a presenterI have to change my mind. Felipe Camiroaga ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Kidd Kraddick in the Morning she said, [...] "It was a learning experience for sure. Sonically it's just not my vibe. I think it would've been a great hit song for somebody else maybe, but it's <b>just</b> not what <b>I</b> like to sing. It's a bubblegum pop record for sure, and I like to sing stuff that's a little more soulful. I love pop music, I'm a huge pop music fan, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that record was right for me."

2500|$|The May 18 {{article in}} The Hill, which was {{published}} prior to Clarke's May 25 claim of responsibility, quoted 9/11 Commission vice-chair Lee H. Hamilton as saying: [...] "We don't know who authorized [...] We've asked that question 50 times." [...] A May 26 article in The Hill quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: [...] "It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the questions are resolved, {{and we need to}} dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem {{to say that he was}} the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to look for some more answers." ...|$|R
500|$|In a May 2012 interview, Whedon {{said that}} it was his {{decision}} to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. [...] "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [...] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were {{some of the most important}} texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'" [...] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|R

500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2017, Scott Stapp {{stated that}} Cornell was [...] "the {{greatest}} pure Rock singer". [...] "I’m really {{a huge fan}} of him, and everything that he has done. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> all around <b>that</b> he is an extremely talented artist, songwriter, singer, and guitar player. He can do so many different things to evoke emotion. From the soulfulness, to the top end of his range when he gets metal and aggressive, to his choice of melodies and how the melody in itself, despite what he’s saying, can incite emotion. I think he’ll {{go down in history as}} one of the greats." ...|$|R
