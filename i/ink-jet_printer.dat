50|$|Due {{to their}} poor color quality and {{increased}} operating expense, color impact models never became {{as popular as}} their monochrome counterparts. As the color ribbon {{was used in the}} printer, the black ink section would gradually contaminate the other 3 colors, changing the consistency of printouts {{over the life of the}} ribbon. Hence, the color dot-matrix was suitable for abstract illustrations and piecharts, but not for photo-realistic reproduction. Dot-matrix thermal-transfer printers offered more consistent color quality, but consumed printer film, still more expensive. Color printing in the home would only become ubiquitous much later, with the <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E

50|$|With the {{transition}} to tabloid format in 1995, Exeposé was produced on a single Apple Macintosh IIcx with a 21 inch monochrome CRT monitor. Increased advertising revenue convinced the Guild to purchase an Apple Power Macintosh 8515 in 1996, and later a Power Macintosh 8600, each with a 21 inch CRT monitor. All Macs ran QuarkXPress 3.32. A scanner and an A3 <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer</b> and Adobe Photoshop 4 on the PowerMacs allowed substantial amounts of pre-production {{to be done in}} the editorial office.

50|$|Reprographics or {{reprography}} {{covers a}} variety of technologies, media, and support services used to make multiple copies of original drawings. Prints of architectural drawings are still sometimes called blueprints, {{after one of the}} early processes which produced a white line on blue paper. The process was superseded by the dye-line print system which prints black on white coated paper (Whiteprint). The standard modern processes are the <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer,</b> laser printer and photocopier, of which the ink-jet and laser printers are commonly used for large-format printing. Although colour printing is now commonplace, it remains expensive above A3 size, and architect's working drawings still tend to adhere to the black and white / greyscale aesthetic.|$|E
50|$|Iris {{printers}} {{have also}} been used since the late 1980s as final output digital printing devices {{in the production of}} fine art reproductions on various media, including paper, canvas, silk, linen and other textiles. There were many printers, photographers, artists, and engineers who saw the merit in using this industrial proof printer as a way to produce high-resolution color accurate reproductions. Color engineer David Coons used the 3024 at the Walt Disney Company to print images from Disney’s new computer 3D animation system. He also wrote software to print works created on desktop computers such as Sally Larsen 1989 Transformer series, and a 1990 photo exhibition for Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Nash was so impressed with the quality of the Iris prints, he purchased his own Iris Graphics 3047 <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer</b> for $126,000 to print further editions of his work and eventually set up Nash Editions, a digital reproduction company based on the Iris printer. There were many problems with adapting the Iris printer to fine art printing including modifying the machines to take heavy paper stock and dealing with the poorly fade-resistant (fugitive) nature of the inks.|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{new models}} and mathematical formulations describing the light scattering and ink spreading phenomena.

Keywords: spectral colour prediction, light scattering, ink spreading, halftones, ink-jet printing. Introduction Several physical phenomena influence colours reproduced by <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers.</b> This makes accurate colour prediction very difficult. The dot gain effect is generally considered to have the largest impact on colour deviations. Dot gain is caused by light scattering or by ink spreading or both together. Intensive investigations on optical dot gain (YuleNielsen effect) have been made, 2, 10, 25 but the resulting prediction models are often very complex. We propose a global approach incorporating all physical contributing phenomena into a single model using a mathematical framework b [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{piezoelectric}} drop-on-demand <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer</b> {{has been}} used to build three-dimensional structures by direct deposition of alumina ink containing sub-micron ceramic particles suspended in an alkane wax. Inks containing up to 40 % v/v alumina were used to produce cubes in which support structures were made from paraffin wax. The fabrication process consists of the sequential deposition of layers of the ceramic suspension by the <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer.</b> This organic vehicle was removed by capillary action in a powder bed followed by pyrolysis before sintering the alumina product. Ink-jet deposition results in the formation of a solid structure after droplet impact and solidification. The distribution of alumina in the solid deposit has been studied and correlated with measurements of shrinkage during the dewaxing and sintering stages. A slight anisotropy is observed in that shrinkage in the z axis is greater than for the in-plane directions...|$|E

50|$|Solid ink {{printers}} have {{an advantage}} over <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers</b> for situations involving intermittent use with long periods of downtime. This is because melted solid ink that has subsequently cooled and re-solidified inside the ink-delivery pathways is {{a normal part of}} printer operation. So, this cooled-and-solidified ink does not dry out. And, while the printer is not operating, the solidified wax helps to prevent oxygen and moisture from interacting with many internal parts of the ink-delivery components.|$|R
