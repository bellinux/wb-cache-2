500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked it all down you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a group of ex-Borg {{would be a very}} interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{went on to}} {{make the}} sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second film written {{specifically}} as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: [...] "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> her audience was missing a treat." [...] Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not {{end up in the}} film. Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E
500|$|Territorial {{representative}} David Levy {{proposed a}} resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842: [...] "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained {{in relation to the}} practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida." [...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E

2500|$|Callahan {{enrolled}} in the University of Washington, but left after two months. Moving to San Francisco, he did illustrations for a children's magazine, and, while living in low-rent apartments with other artists, had his first exposure to contemporary abstract art. At that time he was painting in a realist style inspired by Thomas Hart Benton and the artists of the Ashcan School, but he was deeply impressed by the originality of Klee, Kandinsky, and Feininger. He later told journalist Deloris Tarzan Ament, [...] "It {{was the first time}} <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there could be good art that I didn't like." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of Nine, Yeston left his {{position}} as associate professor at Yale, although he continued to teach a course there every other semester on songwriting. [...] He turned to writing a musical version of Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera. [...] He was approached with the idea by actor/director Geoffrey Holder, who held the American rights to the novel. [...] Initially, Yeston was skeptical of the project. [...] "I laughed and laughed.... That's the worst idea in the world! [...] Why {{would you want to}} write a musical based on a horror story?.... And then <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the story could be somewhat changed.... would be a Quasimodo character, an Elephant Man. [...] Don't all of us feel, despite outward imperfections, that deep inside we're good? [...] And that is a character you cry for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Powell {{left the}} University of Texas {{to take a}} {{position}} as a curator at the National Gallery of Art (NGA). The NGA's director at the time, J. Carter Brown, recruited Powell away from teaching. [...] "I first spotted (Powell) in Austin, Texas. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had rare potential, someone who had a passion for art, but yet had his feet on the ground. He was a people person, yet he could also handle the administrative details...," [...] Brown later said. Powell stayed at the NGA for four years, rising to the position of executive curator in 1979. Brown later said, [...] "Rusty was my right hand for years". During his time as curator, Powell organized some of the NGA's biggest exhibitions, including [...] "The Splendor of Dresden: Five Centuries of Art Collecting" [...] in 1978 and [...] "American Light: The Luminist Movement" [...] in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|Anish Kapoor {{became known}} in the 1980s for his {{geometric}} or biomorphic sculptures made using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment, and plaster. These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. [...] "While making the pigment pieces, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided {{to give them a}} generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there." [...] Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.|$|E
