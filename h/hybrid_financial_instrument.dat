Recognizing that social ventures—just like traditional for-profit and nonprofit enterprises—need capital to flourish, this Article offers a financing tool to transform that skepticism into commitment. Unlike the array of new entities that have emerged in recent years—including L 3 Cs, benefit corporations, and flexible purpose corporations—the <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> this Article describes provides a robust and transparent solution to the puzzle that {{lies at the heart of}} every social enterprise: how to blend a profit motive with a social mission.

40|$|Economic {{development}} in the capital markets {{has led to the}} creation of financial instruments that have the characteristics of both equity and liability, so-called hybrid financial instruments. IASB is trying to create a new way of classifying this kind of instruments. Contingent Convertibles (CoCos), a <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument,</b> have since 2009 become a popular way for banks to reach their capital requirements. This paper seeks to determine if CoCos are perceived by the market as equity or liability. Previous studies indicate that CoCos act to decrease the risk of banks when looking at the potential for bankruptcy and future solvency problems. Our sample consists of 40 listed banks from 2009 until 2015 in EU, including Norway and Switzerland, who follow IFRS. To understand whether CoCos share key characteristics with equity or liability two tests are carried out. The first test looks at the association between CoCos and bank’s common equity risk. The second test looks at the association between leverage and common equity risk when CoCos are calculated under two different accounting regimes, first, if CoCos were treated as a liability and then as if it were treated as equity This study did not find any significant relationships between risk and CoCos or leverage, and therefore it is not able to answer the question whether the market perceives CoCos to share key characteristics with equity or liability.

40|$|Data {{recently}} {{published by the}} Reserve Bank of Australia clearly demonstrates that after a period in abeyance, <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> have again become popular tools for capital raising and management. This raises several questions of practical and theoretical significance, particularly {{in relation to the}} motivation for adopting hybrid instruments as an element of firm capital structure, and the impact of putting this choice into effect. In this paper, we examine two key themes. First, we analyse {{the extent to which the}} rise of hybrid instruments can be justified on the grounds that the use of these instruments can result in lower firm cost of capital. We also investigate the impact on firm financial reports and key metrics of financial performance of risk which result from the deployment of <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> as components of firm capital structure. We conclude by expressing scepticism as to the proposition that the use of hybrid instruments systematically lowers issuer cost of capital, and argue that the use of hybrid instruments has caused material distortions to emerge within the financial statements of firms which employ them. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In 2013, the OECD {{initiated}} {{its very}} comprehensive and ambitious project against base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Largely {{inspired by the}} OECD, similar action to curb BEPS has been taken within the EU. An important part of these organisations’ measures concerns hybrid mismatch arrangements, commonly used by multinationals to achieve BEPS. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> a form of hybrid mismatch arrangement, are <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> that bear characteristics of both debt and equity, which often leads to one country characterising the instrument as debt and another characterising it as equity. This difference in characterisation can be exploited to achieve double non-taxation. However, these instruments are not only used for tax arbitrage, but also for real business reasons. Various rules against mismatches from <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> have been proposed. As an example, the EU amended the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (PSD, 2011 / 96 /EU) with the directive 2014 / 86 /EU to obligate Member States to tax profit distributions that have been deductible by the distributing subsidiary. Wider action against mismatches from <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> has been proposed by the EU in directive proposal COM(2016) 26 final and by the OECD in Action 2 of its 15 -point Action Plan against BEPS. Only one of these anti-hybrid rules, the PSD rule, has been implemented in national laws, although only recently. The other two rules are mere proposals, which together {{with the fact that}} countries have little previous experience of such rules makes a study on them motivated. This thesis examines the feasibility of the EU and OECD measures as one of the tools available to counter mismatches from <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> It analyses and compares these three rules in order to make observations on their interpretation, problems and mutual compatibility, suggesting improvements where fit. The main research method of this study is the dogmatic method. However, even the comparative method is used when the study ventures into the national implementation solutions of the PSD rule in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. 	 The rules are by no means unproblematic. Compatibility with EU primary law, chiefly the basic freedoms, is highly doubtful. There is thus a risk for these actions to be declared void within the Union. Further, these rules link the domestic tax treatment to that of another jurisdiction (linking rules), which causes complexity. This complexity together with sometimes even poorly drafted rules risks causing undesirable effects, such as mutual incompatibility, double taxation and undue compliance burden for the taxpayer. Therefore, care should be taken before introducing any of these rules...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a study of English and US corporate finance law and, in particular, the law in relation to <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> I consider <b>hybrids</b> any <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> that presents a mix of equity and debt characteristics. Therefore this thesis excludes from examination all the derivative instruments, while it focuses on two main types of hybrid security, {{in relation to their}} relevance to the situation studied: preference shares and convertible bonds. Despite a clear distinction in law between equity and debt, the development of sophisticated <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> has forced regulators to look beyond the legal form of an instrument to its practical substance. As observable in practice, the increase in financial innovation reflects the necessity of the parties to allocate control and cash-flow rights in a way that diverges from the classic allocation resulting from equity and debt. Most of the empirical and theoretical research in this area has focused on the tax advantages of issuing hybrids as a way of reducing the cost of capital or on their capacity to be subordinated to all the creditors and to be unable to trigger the liquidation of the firm in case of default on its payouts. However, very little contribution has been made to the analysis of these securities with regard to their implications for corporate governance. This thesis aims to discuss the rationale for issuing hybrids, and to evaluate the law relative to these instruments against the background of both agency costs and property rights theories. The functional approach unveils an important rationale for issuing hybrids. The UK and US have legal systems characterised by transactional flexibility. They rely heavily on ex post standards strategies to protect preference shareholders and on the judiciary to evaluate the fairness of a transaction. This flexibility places the UK and US legal systems among the most business-friendly countries. The vacuum left by mandatory company law in favour of a major flexibility in the market has pushed the parties to fill it contracting for their rights. In so doing they have facilitated the business relations and better protected themselves with careful drafting...|$|R
40|$|The {{compartmentalisation}} {{of company}} finance into equity and debt does not truly capture the enormous diversity of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> available. A {{wide variety of}} hybrid instruments incorporate elements of both equity and debt. From a fiscal point of view the classification of such hybrid instruments as equity or debt is crucial for two reasons. First of all, the issuer can treat interest on the latter as tax-deductible in most cases, and secondly, for the investor the classification determines whether the payments received from the respective instrument is treated as a dividend or as interest. One important question {{in this context is}} how hybrid instruments are treated in the tax treaty between the source state and the residence state.

40|$|The {{concept of}} capital {{has been a}} much debated issue {{throughout}} economic, accounting and finance history. In economics it {{was defined as the}} financial resources utilised by companies while other definitions indicated it represented the actual capital goods themselves. This dualistic meaning of capital has led to various interpretations of the concept of capital and these different interpretations can also be found in the cost of capital model. The cost of capital model is a decision-useful financial tool employed by management to make decisions regarding the financing of projects, performance measurement and risk and return management. The two main forms of funding are debt and equity resources. The cost of capital model was built on the accounting interpretation and classification of the different debt and equity sources of funding. As time went by the financial markets became more sophisticated and new innovative instruments were introduced to help raise financing for companies. Some of these sophisticated instruments and accounting book entries are normally not included in discussion on capital structure and the cost of capital model. The aim of this research is to unbundle and understand the different dimensions of the cost of capital with special focus on the impact of accounting classification on <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and certain accounting book entries. The balance sheet items that have revealed themselves as grey areas of the accounting classification and the hidden constituents of the cost of capital include accounting book entries such as deferred tax and accumulated depreciation, <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and the effect of cash. Currently these instruments pose questions as to their proper debt-equity classification or can {{have an impact on the}} capital structure of an organisation. An adjusted model will be presented that will incorporate any hidden areas related to the debt-equity accounting classification schema. The introduction of these items into the cost of capital model will make it more robust and it will become an even more decision-useful tool for management and analysts a like.

40|$|The aim of {{this book}} {{is to examine the}} Swedish income tax {{treatment}} of derivatives, to ascertain the extent to which this treatment provides tax arbitrage opportunities, and to present possible solution that may prevent existing arbitrage opportunities. This study establishes that {{there are two types of}} <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> that constitute the greatest challenges regarding tax arbitrage opportunities in the Swedish income tax system: <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and synthetic instruments.

Flourishing in state legislatures, even those with the most distinguished pedigrees—such as Delaware’s public benefit corporation—have so far failed to thrive in the marketplace. Fortunately, <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> offer a source of strength and stability that can help social enterprise to take root. This Article examines the valuable role that <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> can play in providing social enterprises with the capital they need to grow. Debt with equity features and equity with debt characteristics constitute the lion’s share of such financial tools.

40|$|One of {{the core}} {{problems}} in the credit crisis of 2007 - 08, which continued in an attenuated form through 2011, is the risk of national banking failure stemming from inadequate banking capital. Basel II, whose main purpose was to set out standards for the regulation of capital of internationally active banks, had encouraged a hybridization of capital which was dramatically reversed by the announcement of Basel III in December 2009. This paper explores {{the rationale for the}} new capital standard under Basel III. We focus on the link between excessive hybridization of tier 1 capital as a result of implementing Basel II, and the subsequent need for government sponsored bailouts during periods of high liquidity risk. This linkage indicates that Basel II had failed to mitigate liquidity risk, and perversely, amplified it by allowing <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> to be treated with equity-like certainty. Basel III in effect represents a failure of the financial economic models of Basel II. To allay these failures, we propose that substantive legal distinctions replace financial risk metrics in drawing distinctions between equity, hybrid capital and debt with regards to core capital. These distinctions will provide a sense of certainty and financial stability to banking capital...|$|R

In contrast to previous studies, the model {{relies on the}} probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} principle of decomposing <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> into their derivative and non-derivative components is widely accepted as {{it results in}} a consistent treatment of hybrid instruments and economically equivalent combinations of contracts. On the other hand, non-contingent derivatives and their economic equivalents are not treated consistently under the mixed accounting model underlying IAS 39. This calls for a critical assessment. The conventional criticism regarding such inconsistencies refers {{to the creation of}} opportunities for earnings management. The aim {{of this paper is to}} add another perspective by including the effects of the related disclosure rules on risk perception by analysts and investors. Thereby, we consider both the presentation on the balance sheet and the additional disclosure in the notes according to IFRS 7. From extant literature, we diligently develop the hypothesis that, due to availability effects, entities using non-contingent derivatives are perceived to be riskier than entities using economic equivalents, although in fact the latter are riskier due to their exposure to additional counterparty risk. This bias in the perception of disclosures might thereby alter an entity’s costs of capital in a way not intended by IAS 39. In particular, we expect individuals to valuate entities using non-contingent derivatives lower than identical entities using economically equivalent contracts instead. We expect this difference in valuation to result from a higher cognitive availability of negative associations with derivatives than with non-derivatives. The underlying assumptions are outlined as they build a framework of hypotheses that could be tested in future research, particularly in experimental survey studies. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} some concern that the pace of {{expectations}} being built up regarding the transfer of ownership of the economy {{into the hands of}} the previously disadvantaged was not allowing for the due diligence and analysis of the implications of such transactions. Tax legislation relating to the transfer of assets is also not seen to be consistently conducive to this process. The focus of this thesis is taxation and a critical analysis of how the current tax legislation affects most of the transactions which usually form the basis of black economic empowerment. It is argued that tax policy is one of the fundamental instruments available to government to encourage the process of black economic empowerment. It is therefore important to assess whether or not current tax legislation is supportive of the process of black economic empowerment and to suggest ways in which it can be amended to serve this purpose. By means of a literature review and a case study of a Black Economic Empowerment deal in the financial sector, the thesis examines various sections of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, which may have a bearing on black economic empowerment transactions and structures, including corporate restructuring rules, the taxation of trusts, inter-company loans, the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> the taxation of small business corporations, employee share incentive schemes, connected persons rules and value-shifting arrangements, the general deduction formula and the deductibility of interest incurred on amounts raised to acquire shares. It appears that although some aspects of the current tax legislation lend themselves to assisting black economic empowerment transactions, there are still areas where much improvement is required.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the pricing of the Contingent Convertible Bonds (CoCos), using the Equity Derivative {{approach}} and the Bates model to simulate the stock price with Monte Carlo algorithm. The CoCo bonds are <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> with loss-absorbency features, characterized by a conversion into equity or a write-down of the face value, when a specified trigger event happens, which is usually related to an accounting indicator of the bank. The Equity Derivative model prices the CoCos under the assumption of the Black-Scholes volatility, converting the accounting trigger into a market trigger. Instead, the thesis aims to underlining {{the impact of a}} more market-conform path of the stock price. Hence, the Bates model is considered more suitable in this pricing framework, allowing the stock prices to have sudden jumps and a time-varying volatility. Therefore, the comparison between the Bates and the Black-Scholes models is made within the Equity Derivative framework. The market trigger is unobservable, thus the analysis of the CoCo prices is done indirectly. Namely, matching the model prices with the observed market prices of two categories of Barclays CoCos, the levels of the implied market trigger are inferred. The higher they are, the higher trigger probabilities should be. However, while the Bates extension provides a market trigger greater than the one in the Black-Scholes case, the related trigger probabilities are lower, overturning the interpretation for which the Bates model provides a riskier valuation of the CoCos. Finally, a number of factors that impact on the model applicability are considered, showing how a complex structure of the CoCo is difficult to be captured by an implied-market approach, as the formulated extension of the Equity Derivative model.

40|$|The term 'structured products' {{which refers}} to a broad {{category}} of <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> linked {{to the performance of}} an underlying asset has been the most commonly used term of the financial markets in the last two decades. While banks worldwide are enthusiastically selling structured products to increase their profitability, investors are attracted to these products in search for yield during periods of low interest rates. Although structured products are being imposed on investors by the Wall Street as a magic solution, they are subject to the same laws of risk and return {{as the rest of the}} capital market: It is impossible to increase income without incurring additional risks and it is impossible to avoid losses without accepting limitations on earnings. For that reason investors need to understand the risks. However, especially for retail investors the complexity in the design of these products makes it difficult to understand the nature of the product they are buying or to assess the risks they are taking on. Therefore regulators, whose first mission is market and investor protection, need to step in to ensure that retail investors receive fair and adequate information about their investment and are not misled into buying structured products which are not suitable for their investment needs. This study, tries to provide a comprehensive research on structured products and attempts to develop a framework to regulate structured products in order to provide an adequate level of investor protection. The framework is prescriptive in nature because it aims to regulate structured products especially in developing countries where investors are less sophisticated. It consists of product approval, defining the boundaries of regulation, providing public information, disclosures, internal control mechanisms and regulatory controls. However, the study concludes that no regulation can take the place of a protection offered by markets and market participants. Market participants should comprehend the importance of investor protection and design their activities around that understanding. As for regulators, rather than banning investors from investing into structured products, they should educate investors not to invest their money in schemes that mislead them into risky, inappropriate investments. For this reason, regulators of financial markets should strive to educate retail investors about the features and risks of structured product in order to provide a comprehensive investor protection...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 - 8 global {{financial}} crisis {{brought to the}} fore {{a new era of}} liquidity risk. Governments around the globe were forced to intervene to preclude a complete collapse of their respective financial and banking systems. The failure of financial supervision was in part caused by segments of the financial system being either inadequately regulated or unregulated. Thus far the international response - including in Hong Kong - has focused on regulatory tools. However, does this approach reflect the prudent management of liquidity risks which threaten financial stability? This thesis will analyse the optimum supervisory model to manage the financial stability of Hong Kong’s banking system when exposed to substantial liquidity risks. The key elements necessary - financial stability, liquidity, and financial supervision of the banking and monetary systems – will be analysed to form a theoretical basis to determine the optimum supervisory model. Supervisory and regulatory issues influencing the relationship between financial supervision and the regulatory toolkit shall be examined in detail under three broad themes, the unified sectoral supervisory structure, integrated and cross-sectoral supervision, and systemic supervision. Unified sectoral supervision will concentrate on the issue of central banking and whether this should be unified or separated from banking supervision when managing market liquidity. The analysis reveals that the HKMA’s constrained monetary policy powers impairs the capacity to manage financial stability. Further market liquidity tools can be successfully implemented by a central bank without a banking supervisory ambit. A unified structure was beneficial to mitigate co-ordination frictions between supervisors. There was no perceived advantage between the Integrated and Sectoral supervisory models when planning the implementation of market liquidity facilities. However the HKMA’s cross-sectoral supervisory ambit is subject to structural biases with the supervision of <b>hybrid</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> suffering from micro-prudential underlap. This flaw can adversely affect the supervision of universal banks’ liquidity ratios. The HKMA is susceptible to a market conduct bias similar to the United Kingdom’s Integrated model. The HKMA does not capture systemic liquidity risks outside the banking system. Systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap and frictions arise between the HKMA and the Financial Stability Council. The HKMA’s supervision of banks’ short-term liquidity ratios is impeded by systemic cross-sectoral micro-prudential underlap. Supervision of OTC derivative financial infrastructure is constrained by the SFC’s and HKMA’s systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap. This underlap encapsulates all financial sectors outside the HKMA’s supervisory ambit, notably the shadow banking system. Renminbi infrastructure is subject to a systemic macro-prudential underlap between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China. Micro-prudential Renminbi banking supervision is inhibited by a supervisory underlap between the HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Despite the HKMA’s supervisory structure reflecting Hong Kong’s banking and monetary systems, the design is structurally flawed when exposed to substantial liquidity risks which threaten financial stability in the banking system. On balance, the optimum supervisory model to manage liquidity risks in Hong Kong’s banking system is the Twin Peaks model. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
