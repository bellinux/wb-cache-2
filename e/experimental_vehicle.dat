40|$|In {{automotive}} R&D {{projects a}} major part of development cost is caused by tests which utilize expensive <b>experimental</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this paper, we introduce an approach for scheduling the individual tests such that the number of required <b>experimental</b> <b>vehicles</b> is minimized. The proposed approach is based on a new type of multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling model with minimum and maximum time lags as well as renewable and cumulative resources. We propose a MILP formulation, which is solvable for small problem instances, as well as several variants of a priority-rule based method that serve to solve large problem instances. The developed solution methods are examined in a comprehensive computational study. For a real-world problem instance it is shown that the introduced approach may enhance the current methods applied in practice.

2500|$|The first {{production}} Routemaster, RM8, {{is preserved}} by the RM8 Club. It {{was displayed at}} the 1958 Commercial Vehicle Show as the new bus for London. It was employed at Chiswick Works as an <b>experimental</b> <b>vehicle</b> upon which many Routemaster modifications were tested. The bus finally entered public service at Sidcup garage in March 1976, being the last Routemaster to enter service and the last open-platform bus to be introduced into service in the UK. It served LT at Sidcup garage until the garage went [...] "one-person" [...] in 1985. It was then preserved by the RM8 Group, which subsequently became the RM8 Club.

2500|$|In June 1915, Sir John French, {{commander}} of the BEF {{found out about the}} ideas put forward by Swinton for caterpillar machine-gun destroyers. French sent the memoranda to the War Office, which in late June began to liaise with the Landships Committee at the Admiralty and specified the characteristics of the desired vehicle. Churchill had relinquished his post in the War Committee but lent his influence to the experiments and building of the tanks. By August, Swinton was able to co-ordinate the War Office specifications for the tanks, Admiralty design efforts and manufacture by the Ministry of Munitions. An <b>experimental</b> <b>vehicle</b> built by Fosters of Lincoln was tested in secret at Hatfield on 2 February 1916 and the results were considered so good that [...] vehicles of the mother design and a prototype of the Mark I tank were ordered.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The article {{deals with}} the advance {{configuration}} and the installation of vehicle components to the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> powered by the traction battery. Particularly the paper focus on the research problems {{of the construction of}} the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> (bogie), the structure of electrical equipment of <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> (traction drive, control system, power supply system and the research problems of the influence between the different systems placed on the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> are mentioned as well. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> which has a foursome mechanically independent drives and each drive has own DSP controller, is specific. The mentioned configuration ensures the coordination of the traction forces between traction drives, which create one bogie with independently rotating wheels, provides the necessary energy flows. For the reason {{of the effects of the}} control to running characteristics the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> has a lot of sensors and the other measuring devices. Findings: The problems of EMC - influence elimination of traction drive with PMSMs, control and measurement are solved. The sophisticated structure of the conception of the vehicle, which is expected to minimization of influence to the sensitive precision measuring equipment from, was designed during the development of the <b>experimental</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> (the minimization was achieved by LCD and LC filter modules). Research limitations/implications: The vehicle with four PMSMs form the whole traction vehicle drive with the total nominal power of 5 kW because of the budget is limited. Originality/value: The special conception of rail vehicle, which is mechanically designed by Rolling Stock Research Institute, is constructed at the JPTF for the purposes of <b>experimental</b> research on <b>vehicles</b> with independently rotating wheels...|$|R
