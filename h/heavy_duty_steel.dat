50|$|Kiyoga, {{a spring}} baton similar in concept to the Asp {{collapsible}} police baton, {{but with the}} center section made of a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>steel</b> spring. The tip and first section slide into the spring, and the whole nests into a seven inch handle. To deploy the kiyoga, all that is necessary is to grasp the handle and swing. This causes the parts to extend from the handle into a baton seventeen inches long. The kiyoga has one advantage over a conventional collapsible baton: it can reach around a raised arm trying to block it to strike the head.|$|E
5000|$|Construction chutes {{are used}} to remove rubble and similar {{demolition}} materials safely from taller buildings. These temporary structures typically consist of a chain of cylindrical or conical plastic tubes, each fitted {{into the top of}} the one below and tied together, usually with chains. Together they form a long flexible tube, which is hung {{down the side of the}} building. The lower end of this tube is placed over a skip or other receptacle, and waste materials are dropped into the top. <b>Heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>steel</b> chutes may also be used when the debris being deposited is heavy duty and in cases of particularly high buildings.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{expedition}} touring bike {{would be}} made of relatively <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>steel</b> tubing, with 26 inch wheels, and componentry chosen for robustness and ease of maintenance. The main design criteria for such a bike would be to allow all-day comfort on the bike, have good handling characteristics under heavy load, and be capable of running smoothly on good roads, {{but also on the}} roughest of tracks. Some bike tourers have made their own expedition bikes, by building up on mountain bike frames. The key difference between a mountain bike and an expedition touring bike would be the addition of racks for panniers, and tougher, all purpose tires. They will have a longer wheelbase to allow for more comfortable cruising, {{at the expense of the}} manoeuvrability of a mountain bike. Most tourers also prefer heavier, stronger wheels than would be normal on a production mountain bike and although some are now equipped with disc brakes to eliminate natural rim side-wall wear. Most expedition bikes will have the same range of gears as a mountain bike and for durability some use the Rohloff Speedhub at the expense of its high cost.|$|E
40|$|Current {{developments}} in roof bolting automation requires fast and effective skin support of underground coal mine roadways. Astrong and tough fibre reinforced polymeric thin spray-on liner (TSL) {{is emerging as}} a logical substitute for the old steel mesh support system. This paper investigates {{the effectiveness of a}} reinforced polymer skin liner in coal mines subject to high horizontal stress. Typically, high lateral stresses induce low angle shear fractures within the roof strata inducing roof convergence and degradation of the roof strata in mine roadways. Fully encapsulated steel bolts provide effective confinement to fractured strata while the strata skin between the bolts remains largely unconfined and prone to failure. Investigations using numerical modelling and laboratory experiments suggest that a polymer basedTSL can outperformsteel mesh and significantly improve stability of the strata skin between the bolts. Strength tests performed on 5 mm thick polymer sheets of indicate load bearing capacities comparable to the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>steel</b> mesh currently used as a skin support underground. Puncture tests and polymer adhesion to the substrata indicate that the polymer TSL can provide additional benefits to the skin support...|$|E

[...] It's revealed that <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> doesn't like Roadblock because of something that went wrong in the past. That's why <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> moved away from his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi and moved away {{to go to college}} and later live in Idaho. While on the hunt for his cousin, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> handcuffs himself to Roadblock. He drags Roadblock into his vehicle which leads them into a car chase until Major Bludd blows up the bridge. Due to Major Bludd firing his laser onto the car as it was sinking, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> loses the keys to his handcuffs. But manages to pull himself and Roadblock out of the river, however they end up in the swamp while evading alligators. Luckily, Roadblock was able to fight off the alligator by wrestling it much to the surprise of <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty.</b> Major Bludd then attacks them in a swamp boat as Roadblock saves <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> from a large snake. After a brief fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them. While Major Bludd prepares a trap for the others, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> work to get out of the handcuffs. At the same time, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> realizes that his cousin was telling the truth when Bludd confirms that he's freelancing with Cobra. The same alligator attacks them, but Snake Eyes rescues them and scares the alligator away. Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> then join the other Joes in fighting off Major Bludd and the Baroness who shows up unexpectedly. After the fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> return to their grandma's house where she revealed that their grandpa had given his inheritance to both of them, making <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> animosity towards his cousin to end. After Ripcord thinking <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty's</b> name meant did a lot of tours of duty, it was revealed that Hershel had been nicknamed by Grandma Hinton stating when he was a baby, he could fill a diaper so fast. When <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> wonders how he's going to explain all of this to Flint, Roadblock tells him that he'll think of something.|$|R
40|$|A general trend {{shows that}} while {{purchasing}} equipment or a machine {{and using them}} it is taken as sacrosanct that the parts / assembly or the mechanism installed are free from any defect and no improvement is required there in. However it’s not true always and now a days this has been taken up with at most concern to raise a pertinent question whether this is the optimum output from the component/assemblies fitted and being used. Present paper {{is based on the}} above subject and deals with one of the assemblies fitted on a heavy earth moving machinery known as Walking Dragline (Ransome and Rapier, made in UK) operating in Jayant OCM one of the biggest coal mines in Asia. The component placed on the Boom structure of the machinery in question was a fixed one and subjected to static friction because of coming into contact with <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>steel</b> wire ropes (2 numbers) in moving conditions. The impact of the wire ropes on the component was so heavy that it was taking only a few months to get the static wooden log worn out resulting into heavy loss to both the components on one hand, crores of rupees of revenue loss in production in addition to very high safety hazard because of their fitment/replacement at a height of 40 meters from the ground to which lifting by even general duty crane was not possible, thus to be handled by manually at time...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars, adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R
