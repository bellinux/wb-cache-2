40|$|The present work {{describes}} the synthesis and characterization {{of a series}} of organochalcogen compounds derived from beta-chlorocyclohexenal (27 a) /beta-bromocyclohexenal (27 b) which are stabilized by E center dot center dot center dot O (E = S, Se, Te) intramolecular secondary bonding interaction (IM-SBI). Di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) sulfide (21) was prepared by treating 27 b with <b>disodium</b> <b>sulfide.</b> Di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) diselenide (28) was obtained by reacting 27 a with disodium diselenide. The reaction always produced a mixture of di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) diselenide (28) and di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) selenide (29). Attempts to synthesize di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) ditelluride 30 by the reaction of 27 b with disodium ditelluride afforded a mixture of monotellurides; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 2 H- 9 -telluraanthracene- 1 -carbaldehyde (26), di-(2 -formylcyclohex- 1 -ene) telluride (22) and 9 -hydroxy- 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 a-octahydro- 1 H-telluroxanthene- 4 -carbaldehyde (31). Reactions of 28 with halogenating reagents afforded the corresponding organylselenenyl halides; selenenyl chloride 35, selenenyl bromide 36 and selenenyl iodide 37. Tellurides 26 and 22 were used as ligands for metal complexation reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{behavior of}} the antifluorite Na 2 S, <b>disodium</b> <b>sulfide,</b> has been studied under pressure up to 22 GPa by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments in a diamond anvil cell at room temperature. At approximately 7 GPa, Na 2 S undergoes a first phase transition to the orthorhombic anticotunnite (PbCl 2) structure (Pnma, Z = 4). The lattice parameters at 8. 2 GPa are a = 6. 707 (5), b = 4. 120 (3), c = 8. 025 (4) Å. At approximately 16 GPa, Na 2 S undergoes a second transition adopting {{the structure of the}} Ni 2 In-type (P 63 /mmc, Z = 2). The lattice parameters at 16. 6 GPa are a = 4. 376 (18), c = 5. 856 (9) Å. Both pressure-induced phases have been confirmed by full Rietveld refinements. An inspection of the cation array of Na 2 SO 4 reveals that its Na 2 S subarray is also of the Ni 2 In-type. This feature represents a new example of how the cation arrangements in ternary oxides correspond to the topology of the respective binary compounds. We discuss analogies between the insertion of oxygen and the application of pressure. Peer reviewe...|$|E
