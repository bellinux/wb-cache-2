5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to encourage more domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserves,</b> which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E
5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserves</b> had {{declined}} from $42million {{at the end}} of 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E

25|$|Under a fixed {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the foreign exchange market to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the exchange rate between the country's currency and other currencies. Then the net change {{per year in the}} central bank's <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserves</b> is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a {{fixed exchange}} rate system include a managed float where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely floating exchange rate (also known as a purely flexible exchange rate). With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its currency, allowing the rate to be set by the market, and the central bank's <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserves</b> do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.|$|E
25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserves.</b> Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the decentralized management of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to trade deficits in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an import and export licensing system, stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and semi-finished goods, rather than consumer goods, were imported.

50|$|The XDR {{comes to}} {{prominence}} when the U.S. dollar is weak or otherwise unsuitable to be a <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserve</b> asset.

If the United States had continued down this path, the dollar would have become a less attractive <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reserve</b> asset: it would not have had the necessary liquidity to serve this function.
