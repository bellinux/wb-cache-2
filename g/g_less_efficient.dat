40|$|With the {{accelerating}} {{adoption of}} electric vehicles, using the batteries {{in the existing}} vehicle fleet to discharge to the power grid when needed (vehicle-to-grid, V 2 G) provides a potential alternative for supplying grid support. This master project focused on the often-overlooked side of V 2 G, the energy efficiency, and compared V 2 G versus other grid support technologies {{in terms of their}} efficiencies and emissions. Given V 2 G is most suitable for regulation service, other available technologies serving regulation were selected for the comparison. The project adopted a fuel-to-grid scope when conducting the comparison among different grid support technologies, meaning the efficiency at which fuels are converted into final grid support, along with the associated emissions, were analyzed and compared. The comparison led to three major findings: (1) energy storage-based technologies achieve a lower fuel-to-grid efficiency than gas turbines do; (2) V 2 <b>G</b> is <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> in delivering grid support than grid-dedicated battery banks and flywheels; (3) storage-based technologies, especially V 2 G, would significantly increase CO 2, SO 2, and NOx emissions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAPOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 F exhibit {{antiretroviral}} activity {{primarily as}} a consequence of their ability to deaminate cytidines in retroviral DNA. Here, we compare the properties of APOBEC 3 F and APOBEC 3 G from human, macaque, and African green monkey (AGM). While all APOBEC proteins tested exhibited anti-HIV- 1 activity, human APOBEC 3 F was, surprisingly, 10 - to 50 -fold less potent than human APOBEC 3 G. However, similar discrepancies in antiviral potency were not found when pairs of proteins from macaque and AGM were compared. Intrinsic differences in the ability of each APOBEC protein to induce hypermutation, rather than differences in packaging efficiency, partially accounted for variable antiretroviral activity. Each of four primate lentivirus Vif proteins reduced human and AGM APOBEC 3 F expression and antiviral activity, but all were only partially effective and species-specific effects were relatively minor. Overall, highly efficient and species-specific neutralization of APOBEC 3 <b>G,</b> and <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> neutralization of APOBEC 3 F, appears to be a general property of Vif proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “functional selectivity” or “biased signaling” {{suggests}} that a ligand can have distinct efficacies with regard to different signaling pathways. We have investigated {{the question of whether}} biased signaling may be related to distinct agonist-induced conformational changes in receptors using the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) and its two endogenous ligands epinephrine and norepinephrine as a model system. Agonist-induced conformational changes were determined in a fluorescently tagged β 2 AR FRET sensor. In this β 2 AR sensor, norepinephrine caused signals that amounted to only ≈ 50 % of those induced by epinephrine and the standard “full” agonist isoproterenol. Furthermore, norepinephrine-induced changes in the β 2 AR FRET sensor were slower than those induced by epinephrine (rate constants, 47 versus 128 ms). A similar partial β 2 AR activation signal was revealed for the synthetic agonists fenoterol and terbutaline. However, norepinephrine was almost as efficient as epinephrine (and isoproterenol) in causing activation of Gs and adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, fenoterol was quite efficient in triggering β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the cell surface and its interaction with β 2 AR, as well as internalization of the receptors, whereas norepinephrine caused partial and slow changes in these assays. We conclude that partial agonism of norepinephrine at the β 2 AR is related to the induction of a different active conformation and that this conformation is efficient in signaling to <b>Gs</b> and <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> in signaling to β-arrestin 2. These observations extend the concept of biased signaling to the endogenous agonists of the β 2 AR and link it to distinct conformational changes in the receptor...|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} growing Geobacter sulfurreducens under {{anaerobic}} conditions in chemostats {{was developed in}} order to study the physiology of this organism under conditions that might more closely approximate {{those found in the}} subsurface than batch cultures. Geobacter sulfurreducens could be cultured under acetate-limiting conditions with fumarate or Fe(III) -citrate as the electron acceptor at growth rates between 0. 04 and 0. 09 h(- 1). The molar growth yield was threefold higher with fumarate as the electron acceptor than with Fe(III), despite the lower mid-point potential of the fumarate/succinate redox couple. When growth was limited by availability of fumarate, high steady-state concentrations were detected, suggesting that fumarate is unlikely to be an important electron acceptor in sedimentary environments. The half-saturation constant, Ks, for acetate in Fe(III) -grown cultures (10 microM) suggested that the growth of Geobacter species is likely to be acetate limited in most subsurface sediments, but that when millimolar quantities of acetate are added to the subsurface in order to promote the growth of Geobacter for bioremediation applications, this should be enough to overcome any acetate limitations. When the availability of electron acceptors, rather than acetate, limited growth, <b>G.</b> sulfurreducens was <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> in incorporating acetate into biomass but had higher respiration rates, a desirable physiological characteristic when adding acetate to stimulate the activity of Geobacter species during in situ uranium bioremediation. These results demonstrate that the ability to study the growth of G. sulfurreducens under steady-state conditions can provide insights into its physiological characteristics that have relevance for its activity in a diversity of sedimentary environments...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{losses in}} solar cells {{caused by the}} {{spectral}} mismatch can be reduced by adapting the solar spectrum using a downconversion material where one higher energy visible photon is 'cut' into two lower energy near-infrared photons that both can be absorbed by the solar cell. Downconversion with the (Pr 3 +, Yb 3 +) couple in YF 3 is investigated. Based on analysis of luminescence and diffuse reflectance spectra {{it is evident that}} two-step energy transfer takes place from the 3 P 0 level of Pr 3 + (around 490 nm) exciting two Yb 3 + to the 2 F 5 / 2 level giving emission around 980 nm. The transfer efficiency increases with Yb 3 + concentration and is 86 % for YF 3 doped with 0. 5 % Pr 3 + and 30 % Yb 3 +. Due to concentration quenching the intensity of emission from Yb 3 + is strongly reduced and the 2 F 5 / 2 emission intensity reaches a maximum for the sample with 0. 5 % Pr 3 + and 2 - 5 % Yb 3 + at 300 K. Temperature dependent measurements reveal the role of the Pr 3 + 1 G 4 level in the energy transfer between Pr 3 + and Yb 3 +. Back-transfer of excitation energy from the Yb 3 + 2 F 5 / 2 level to the 1 G 4 level of Pr 3 + occurs and quenches the Yb 3 + emission. The quenching is shown to become more efficient between 4 and 50 K due to faster phonon-assisted energy transfer between the Yb 3 + donors. Upon raising the temperature from 50 to 300 K, the luminescence life time of the Yb 3 + emission increases again because the small energy difference between the Pr 3 + (1 G 4) level and the Yb 3 + (2 F 5 / 2) level (∼ 300 cm- 1) which makes the 1 <b>G</b> 4 <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> as a trap for the excitation energy.

50|$|For a given power supply, {{efficiency}} varies {{depending on}} how much power is being delivered. Supplies are typically most efficient at between half and three quarters load, much <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> at low load, and somewhat <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> at maximum load. Older ATX power supplies were typically 60% to 75% efficient. To qualify for 80 Plus, a power supply must achieve at least 80% efficiency at three specified loads (20%, 50% and 100% of maximum rated power). However, 80 Plus supplies may still be <b>less</b> than 80% <b>efficient</b> at lower loads. For instance, an 80 Plus, 520 watt supply could still be 70% or <b>less</b> <b>efficient</b> at 60 watts (a typical idle power for a desktop computer).
