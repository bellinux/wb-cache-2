5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria has {{produced}} a large landslide deposit as well as flows of molten sulfur. A progressive uplift of the terrain around Lastarria and <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> has been recognized.|$|E
5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region <b>farther</b> <b>south.</b> This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E

5|$|East of Fort Covington, NY37 {{follows a}} more southeasterly routing as it {{separates}} from the northernmost extents of the state. In the Westville hamlet of Westville Center, NY37 meets the western terminus of NY122. <b>Farther</b> <b>south,</b> NY37 enters {{the village of}} Malone, where it terminates at US11, NY11B and NY30.|$|E
5|$|<b>Farther</b> <b>south,</b> Tyrion and {{his small}} retinue stop {{to spend the}} night at the Inn at the Crossroads. There he recognizes Lady Catelyn Stark in disguise. With her {{identity}} revealed, she requests help from her father's bannermen present at the inn to seize Tyrion to face trial for Bran's attempted murder.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southwest}} of Aliso Creek, Sulphur Creek historically lay in {{the territory of the}} Acjachemen Indian group, whose main population center was actually <b>farther</b> <b>south,</b> at the confluence of San Juan and Trabuco creeks.|$|E

5|$|A major crustal lineament {{known as}} the Archibarca lineament intersects the main {{volcanic}} arc at Lastarria. Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament. The intersection between this lineament and the arc may act as a weakness zone that focuses the ascent of magma. <b>Farther</b> <b>south</b> lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the losses}} of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, {{northern}} Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, {{the site of}} a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> via the Tennessee River.|$|E
5|$|Although NY18 {{is signed}} as east–west, it runs {{primarily}} north–south through the western portion of Niagara County. After leaving Niagara County, NY18 shifts <b>farther</b> <b>south,</b> gradually {{moving away from}} the shore of Lake Ontario. In central Orleans County, NY18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY18 veers south to follow a more inland routing.|$|E

5|$|East of US285, {{the route}} enters {{the town of}} Center, where it skirts {{the south side of}} town as 8th Street. Here, it meets a {{railroad}} that connects the town to Sugar Junction <b>farther</b> <b>south.</b> The route moves east through farmland, where it meets County Road 100, which continues south to SH15. It then skirts along the county line all the way east to SH17 at the north side of Hooper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Farther</b> <b>south,</b> in Guinea-Bissau, a {{storm surge}} flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and {{military}} barracks. The sea water submerged {{vast amounts of}} cropland in the Tombali Region, resulting in great losses of rice. Offshore, waves as high as 23feet (7m) capsized a fishing boat with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|In his Year 2, Amenemhat IV sent another {{expedition}} to mine amethyst in the Wadi el-Hudi {{in the south}} of Egypt. The leader of the expedition was the assistant treasurer Sahathor. <b>Farther</b> <b>south,</b> three Nile-records are known from Kumna in Nubia that are explicitly dated to his Years 5, 6 and 7 on the throne, showing that the Egyptian presence in the region was maintained during his lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In the 1940s, a {{religious}} movement called Allah Koura {{began in the}} San Cercle based upon the visions of a single person. Local administrators allowed the Allah Koura movement to spread and practice, seeing it as a potential limiting influence on the spread of Islam <b>farther</b> <b>south.</b> In the late 1950s, Muslim protests and riots throughout the colony further contributed to a growing independence movement.|$|E
5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to the}} northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> on that corner.|$|E
5|$|The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, {{is defined}} by {{regional}} kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from <b>farther</b> <b>south,</b> who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still <b>farther</b> <b>south.</b> No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared {{to make way for}} the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.|$|E

5|$|The {{small boat}} drifts <b>farther</b> <b>south</b> on a current of {{increasingly}} warm water, {{which has become}} milky white in color. After several days they encounter a rain of ashes and then observe a huge cataract of fog or mist, which splits open to accommodate their entrance upon approach. The native dies as a huge shrouded white figure appears before them.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} from the {{mainland}} {{is limited to the}} immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent {{to the park}} headquarters at Convoy Point. <b>Farther</b> <b>south</b> Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near {{the north end of the}} park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. <b>Farther</b> <b>south</b> at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
