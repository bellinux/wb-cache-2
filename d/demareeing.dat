The theory is that forager bees will think that the hive has swarmed {{if there is a}} drastic reduction in nurse bees, and that nurse bees will think that the hive has swarmed if the queen appears to be missing and/or there is a drastic reduction in forager bees.|$|E

5000|$|The team's {{principal}} leader, Micky Rosa is {{a composite}} character based primarily on Bill Kaplan, JP Massar, and John Chang. Bill Kaplan founded and led the MIT Blackjack Team in the 1980s and co-managed the team with Massar and Chang from 1992 to 1993, during which time Jeff Ma joined the then nearly 80 person team. Chang has questioned the book's veracity, telling The Boston Globe, [...] "I don't even know {{if you want to}} call the things in there exaggerations, because they're so exaggerated they're basically untrue." [...] Whether the MIT Blackjack Team was [...] "founded ... in the 1980s" [...] is in dispute. An article in The Tech, January 16, 1980, suggests that Roger <b>Demaree</b> and JP Massar were already running the team and teaching a hundred MIT students to play blackjack by the third week of the 1980s, implying that the team had been founded in the late 1970s, before Kaplan joined, although <b>Demaree</b> and Massar have mostly avoided publicity.|$|R

The similar pathogens were also differentiated as perfect and imperfect, as the Blackberry Leaf Spot pathogen didn’t have a known sexual stage.|$|R
