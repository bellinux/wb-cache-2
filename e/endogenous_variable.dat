The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable</b> and exogenous parameter.

The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled {{as the dependent variable}} and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables.

30|$|Mathematically, Eqs. (1)–(11) form {{a linear}} {{system that can}} be solved given the non-singularity of the related matrix of coefficients. Necessary and {{sufficient}} conditions for non-singularity are squareness {{of the system and}} linear independence of equations. The general system of algebraic equations can be represented compactly as AX[*]=[*]C. Here A is the Jacobian matrix (coefficients of the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> of the model), X represents the matrix of <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> (prices and quantities) while the right-hand side matrix denotes the exogenous variables (policy shocks). Thereafter, we can apply Cramer’s rule to solve for the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|R

30|$|Moving {{from the}} {{measurement}} {{part of the}} model to the structural part, there are three types of parameters of interest. The Phi matrix describes {{the relationship of the}} exogenous variables to each other. The Gamma matrix describes the direct effects of the exogenous <b>variables</b> on the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables.</b> The Beta matrix describes the relationship of the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> to each other.|$|R

30|$|In the {{numerical}} experiments that we perform, our model determines {{the evolution of}} the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables,</b> given the initial capital stock in 1970 as measured in the data. The <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> react to {{the evolution of the}} exogenous variables, which are the evolution of TFP of GDP at factor prices, the evolution of the working-age population, and the evolution of tax rates as measured in the data.|$|R
50|$|Then, {{we can use}} (z1,z2,z3) as {{instruments}} to estimate the coefficients in the above equation since there are one <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable</b> (y2) and one excluded exogenous variable (z2) on the right hand side.

30|$|In {{estimating}} the WTP, variables affecting {{the responses of}} the households play an important role. Despite the difficulties in interpreting the analysis of WTP data of <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> (Bateman 2002), along with exogenous variables, they were used to form the WTP model. Exogenous variables are those over which the household has no choice and <b>endogenous</b> <b>variables</b> are those whose values are determined through choices made by the household.|$|R

50|$|After the {{subsequent}} equations are substituted {{into the first}} three equations above, one has a system of three equations in three unknowns, {{two of which are}} GDP and the domestic interest rate. Under flexible exchange rates, the exchange rate is the third <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable</b> while BoP is set equal to zero. In contrast, under fixed exchange rates e is exogenous and the balance of payments surplus is determined by the model.|$|E
50|$|Comparative statics {{results are}} usually derived {{by using the}} {{implicit}} function theorem to calculate a linear approximation to the system of equations that defines the equilibrium, {{under the assumption that}} the equilibrium is stable. That is, if we consider a sufficiently small change in some exogenous parameter, we can calculate how each <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable</b> changes using only the first derivatives of the terms that appear in the equilibrium equations.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{multipliers}} {{can also}} be calculated. That is, one can ask how a change in some exogenous variable in year t affects endogenous variables in year t, in year t+1, in year t+2, and so forth. A graph showing the impact on some <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable,</b> over time (that is, the multipliers for times t, t+1, t+2, etcetera), is called an impulse-response function. The general method for calculating impulse response functions is sometimes called comparative dynamics.|$|E

50|$|Without {{restrictions}} on the A and B, the coefficients of A and B cannot be identified from data on y and z: each row of the structural model is just a linear relation between y and z with unknown coefficients. (This is again the parameter identification problem.) The M reduced form equations (the rows of the matrix equation y = Π z above) can be identified from the data because each of them contains only one <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Control {{functions}} are statistical methods to correct for endogeneity problems by modelling the endogeneity in the error term. The approach thereby differs {{in important ways}} from other models that try {{to account for the}} same econometric problem. Instrumental variables, for example, attempt to model the <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable</b> X as an often invertible model with respect to a relevant and exogenous instrument Z.

5000|$|To {{recover the}} {{underlying}} parameter , we introduce {{a set of}} variables Z that is highly correlated with each endogenous component of X but (in our underlying model) is not correlated with e. For simplicity, one might consider X to be a T × 2 matrix composed of a column of constants and one <b>endogenous</b> <b>variable,</b> and Z to be a T × 2 consisting of a column of constants and one instrumental variable. However, this technique generalizes to X being a matrix of a constant and, say, 5 endogenous variables, with Z being a matrix composed of a constant and 5 instruments. In the discussion that follows, we will assume that X is a T x K matrix and leave this value K unspecified.
