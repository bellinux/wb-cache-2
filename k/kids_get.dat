Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I feel like I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence.

[...] Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan said that they look like [...] "hip-hop as designed by committee." [...] Raquel Wilson, editor in chief of hip-hop e-zine Verbalisms said: [...] "They completely misrepresent the culture." [...] Dr John Richer, a clinical child psychologist in Oxford, England said: [...] "This has the same sort of flavour as beauty contests in America where little <b>kids</b> <b>get</b> dolled up as teenagers." [...] Miriam , {{the editor in chief of}} Child described the dolls' multiculturalism as positive: [...] "a very nice way of helping children all over the country realize that people look many different ways." [...] Several British toy industry analysts expected the Flavas dolls to sell well, one of them saying that [...] "the risqué nature of these dolls would guarantee their success." [...] But they sold poorly—Wall Street Journal described their results as [...] "disastrous". According to AP some analysts believed Flavas were just [...] "too edgy." [...] Businessweek said that the [...] "clunky jewelry and graffiti on the packaging ... scared away mothers and left kids cold." [...] They ended up being taken off the market after less than a year. Several Mattel executives were let go following the discontinuation. Moe Tkacik of Slate described Flavas as [...] "ridiculous, but in a cute way" [...] and questioned if their hasty withdrawal had been premature, suggesting they could have found a niche market.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the race}} for the seat on the SBOE, the nonprofit {{watchdog}} group Texas Freedom Network (TFN), which first brought Bruner's posts to public attention, warned that the SBOE has a history of mixing culture wars with public education and criticized many of Bruner's public statements immediately prior to her primary election. While some of Bruner's posts were later deleted, TFN and journalists of numerous Texas and national publications made screen shots of the posts and began reporting on them, questioning her fitness to hold public office. When asked about her public statements, Bruner defended them, saying [...] "I don't intend to apologize for my opinions because I still believe my statements were accurate." [...] After Bruner's defeat, TPN president Kathy Miller issued a statement saying: [...] "Texas escaped an education train wreck tonight.

2500|$|In honour of Dahl, the Royal Gibraltar Post Office {{issued a}} set of four stamps in 2010 {{featuring}} Quentin Blake's original illustrations for four of the children's books written by Dahl during his long career; The BFG, The Twits, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Matilda. A set of six stamps was issued by Royal Mail in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Twits, The Witches, Matilda, Fantastic Mr Fox, and James and the Giant Peach. Dahl's influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance film director Tim Burton recalled from childhood [...] "the second layer [...] of connecting to a writer who gets {{the idea of the}} modern fable – and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that <b>kids</b> <b>get.</b> I've always like that, and it's shaped everything I've felt that I've done." [...] Steven Spielberg read The BFG to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it's OK to be different as well as to have an active imagination: [...] "It's very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing." [...] Actress Scarlett Johansson named Fantastic Mr Fox one of the five books that made a difference to her.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{emerged on}} May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted {{a clip of}} King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. [...] King, talking to high-school students, had said: [...] "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. [...] If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that." [...] The comment was described by the blog as [...] "another {{in a long line}} of liberal media members bashing the military," [...] and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. [...] King responded later that day, saying, [...] "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." [...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that <b>kids</b> <b>get</b> better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|E
