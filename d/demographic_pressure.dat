5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{intensive}} agriculture. Some forests locally known as bouças are defined areas with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
5|$|The Senne {{had long}} since lost its {{usefulness}} as a navigable waterway, being replaced by canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne {{had always been a}} river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the sluice gates were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{from the}} colonists grew, the {{remaining}} Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to Indian reservations. Though some Natives escaped being {{swept into the}} reservation, most were moved to the Grand Ronde reservation in 1856. Strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people, known as Métis in French, {{had to make a}} choice between the reservation and Anglo society. Native Americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian {{crisis has}} {{significantly}} affected Lebanese {{economic and financial}} situation. The <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> imposed by the Syrian refugees now living in Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct consequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A loss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also been registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170.000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every year.|$|E
25|$|The major uprisings {{involved}} the sekbans (irregular troops of musketeers) and sipahis (cavalrymen maintained by land grants). The rebellions were not attempts {{to overthrow the}} Ottoman government but were reactions to a social and economic crisis stemming {{from a number of}} factors: <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> following a period of unprecedented population growth during the 16th century, climatic hardship associated with the Little Ice Age, a depreciation of the currency, and the mobilization of thousands of sekban musketeers for the Ottoman army during its wars with the Habsburgs and Safavids, who turned to banditry when demobilized. Celali leaders often sought no more than to be appointed to provincial governorships within the empire, while others fought for specific political causes, such as Abaza Mehmed Pasha's effort to topple the Janissary government established after the regicide of Osman II in 1622, or Abaza Hasan Pasha's desire to overthrow the grand vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the trend}} toward {{thinning}} the parcels was not universal. The vertical logic imposed by the formula of the East India Company was not immutable and rather quickly, {{in order to deal}} with <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure,</b> there started to appear horizontal boundaries cutting the original strips into several plots situated one above the other. In 1732, the surveyor Durongoüet was tasked with tracing four surveyors' lines parallel to the shore, at altitudes of 100, 200, 400 and 600 m. These lines, which correspond to the topographic notion of level curves, are still visible today, especially above the centre of Saint-Pierre, in the southern part of the island. Today these are navigable roads lined with houses that form evocatively named towns away from the centre: Ligne Paradis at around 100 m altitude, Ligne des Bambous at about 200 m, Ligne des Quatre-cents ("Line of the Four Hundreds") a little further and Ligne des Six-cents ("Line of the Six Hundreds") right at the top.|$|E
2500|$|The Saas tree has an {{economic}} {{value to the}} Serers. [...] Its dual economic role benefits both the agricultural and pastoral Serers. A Saas tree {{in a field of}} millets increases millet production. The leaves fertilize the soil, the branches and fruit act as a sort of meadow which saves air thereby preventing Serer herds from starvation. There is also a relationship between Saas density per hectare and the <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> per hectare. An abundant Saas allows crop rotation and intensive farming such as the triangular Diohine-Ngayokhem-Ñakhar (parts of [...] ). In spite of the allegations levied against it by the ancients, many Serers still believe Saas to be the tree of life, the sacred and the transcendence.|$|E

5000|$|Particularly, {{valley and}} glacis {{are exposed to}} higher {{agriculture}} pressure and the trend is to the extensification of croplands. This happens in three ways: the first one, by restoration of degraded lands; the second is by reclamation of grasslands {{and the last one}} by clearing of woody vegetation. The first method, supported by the PDR-ADM, concerns the slopes of the Keita valley and also the sandy dunes of the eastern plateaux. Land reclamation of grasslands has been pushed by <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> especially in the Keita and Insafari valleys. Woody vegetation clearing happens especially in the secondary valleys where <b>demographic</b> <b>pressure</b> was low before 1984 and strongly increased later. On the other hand, woody vegetation restoration interests large areas on the slopes and also in the valleys as gallery forests. This trend on the slopes is particularly interesting where it is not directly due to Project interventions (plantation in trenches), because it shows the effectiveness of the watershed approach and the water management on plateaux and slopes.|$|E
