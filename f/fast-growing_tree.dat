5|$|Ficus aurea is a <b>fast-growing</b> <b>tree.</b> As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy}} of a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The fast-growing and high-yielding timber {{plantation}} base {{construction engineering}} initiated in 2002, and it’s the sixth largest forest project in China. Did the project have influence to the grain {{production in the}} past ten years? And how much the influence is? Based on this problem, the study selects Hebei province as the research area, which is around Beijing-Tianjin, and the geographical position is particularly important. It analyzes Hebei’s <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> planting area, grain sown area and yield from land using angle. Research shows that <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> planting’s time and space difference is very wide in Hebei and each city, but its influence is very small for the grain sown area, and has no effect on total grain yield. Because <b>Fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> can improve ecological environment and bring huge economic benefits, it can continue to be planted in Hebei’s suitable area in the future. The <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> planting should occupy less cultivated land as far as possible, and reduce the influence to grain production. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{communities}} of epigeic beetles in the plantations of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> (poplar clone Japanese J - 105 (Jap = - 105, Max - 4, Maxvier) and surrounding habitats (Zea mays L.). A cover of Zea mays L. was used as an area for comparison. Sampling was carried out in 2012 by using the method of epigeic beetles in pitfall traps (period from May to September). During the sampling, altogether 1054 specimens and 57 species of epigeic beetles were collected. In the area of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> ?Na Vrbovecku? 528 specimens were collected which is many times more than in other researched areas. In the cover of Zea mays L. in the area "Na Vrbovecku" 293 specimens were collected and in the zone of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> "U rybníka" 233 specimens were catched; notice the high similarity in the number of collected specimens. At all sites surveyed the expansive species (E) outnumbered the II relics. There were about 70 % of expansive species in the cover of Japanese poplar found and in the cover of Zea mays L. there were about 90 % of expansive species found. The number of more adaptable species- RII category- found in the cover of Japanese poplar was approximately 30 % unlike the number of the same species found inside the Zea mays L. cover was only 12 %. The rare species Xantholinus gallicus of the RI category was found in the plantations of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> "U rybníka". The index of anthropogenic impact on communities (ISD) was very low in studied plots. In the Zea mays L. cover the index was only 6 points, unlike in the cover of Japanese poplar where the index reached 24 points. Yet all researched areas show high anthropogenic impact. Based on the obtained results (epigeic beetles), it seems that plantations of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> have a positive impact on communities of epigeic beetles in cultural landscape. Since the research was always carried out on a farmed landscape, the impact of surrounding landscape on gained results is minimal and insignificant...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to analyse {{possibilities}} of growing biomass in less-favoured areas (LFA) in Czechia. This work evaluates existing development and potentialities trends in using biomass and less-favoured areas at first. In this tendency is raising interest of European union (EU) and Czechie for renewable energy source noticeable. For czech situation is the biomass (and within this energyplant of second generation) the best variation. Using for heatproduction is the best variant of this crop. In the case of LFA is using dotation for grassing in the EU and since 1989 in Czechia too. The Grassing is natural process, becouse of a low economic rentability, but there are another variants of using this places. LFA like a localities for rising the <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> {{is one of these}} variants. This work mentions rising <b>fast-growing</b> <b>trees</b> on a half part of LFA. The benefits of this potential situation are in good ecology of region and in many social factors too.
