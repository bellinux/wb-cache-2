5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki walking into a small orange-lit room with a black object on a stall. After touching it, the <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> starts to light up, and the singer subsequently walks around singing to the song; scenes are digitally-altered and edited during the process. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is seen wearing a white outfit while a mysterious light shines around the room. The video subsequently ends with the singer sitting on a small chair, looking in the distance. The clip was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best (2016). The visual was additionally used as the theme song for Japanese cosmetics company Aube's launch of their lipstick range, which led to Hamasaki becoming their spokeswoman and appearing in a campaign video.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E

50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1990s, {{mainframes}} were very large machines that often occupied <b>entire</b> <b>rooms.</b> The rooms were often air conditioned and had special power arrangements {{to accommodate the}} three-phase electric power required by the machines. Modern mainframes are now physically comparatively small and require little or no special building arrangements.|$|R
25|$|The contestants {{worked in}} teams {{of two to}} design a room for a mystery judge based on five {{personal}} items the judge feels represents them. Heather and Lisa did not get along, as Lisa insisted on planning the <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> herself, to which Heather reluctantly acquiesced. John and Michael took an instant dislike to one another, as Michael felt John was too harsh on him, and John felt Michael was too prissy. The mystery judge was Alexis Arquette.|$|E
25|$|Depending on culture, {{there may}} be varying degrees of {{separation}} {{between men and women}} and different levels of privacy. Typically, the <b>entire</b> <b>room,</b> or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is lockable. Urinals, if present in a men's toilet, are typically mounted on a wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be not much more than an open latrine. Another form is a street urinal known as a pissoir, after the French term.|$|E
25|$|Having {{acquired}} {{the centerpiece of}} the room, Whistler's painting of The Princess from the Land of Porcelain, American industrialist and aesthete Charles Lang Freer purchased the <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> in 1904 from Leyland's heirs, including Leyland's daughter and her husband, the British artist Val Prinsep. Freer then had the contents of the Peacock Room installed in his Detroit mansion. After Freer's death in 1919, The Peacock Room was permanently installed in the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923. A large painted caricature by Whistler of Leyland portraying him as an anthropomorphic peacock playing a piano, and entitled The Gold Scab: Eruption in Frilthy Lucre - a pun on Leyland's fondness for frilly shirt fronts - is now {{in the collection of the}} Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and birdseed standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and re-assembly object', each new incarnation gradually acquired working drawings, paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the rabbit's hutch for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an <b>entire</b> <b>room.</b> By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including pebbly earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while the skylight over the <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1919, Hearst {{began to}} build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a [...] ranch at San Simeon, California, which he {{furnished}} with art, antiques and <b>entire</b> <b>rooms</b> brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier).|$|R
50|$|Collectors {{display and}} store their keychains in several {{different}} ways. Some collections are small enough that the collector can place all of their keychains on their standard key ring. Some larger collections can be stored and displayed on dowels, cork boards, tool racks, on large link chains, in display cases, hung on walls, displayed on Christmas trees. Some collections are large enough that <b>entire</b> <b>rooms</b> are dedicated to the keychain collection.|$|R
50|$|UNIVAC I, {{which stands}} for Universal Automatic Computer 1, used {{magnetic}} tape to store data, {{and was the first}} commercial computer produced in the United States.

But the central idea of using magnetic tape to store information is a concept that is still in use today.|$|R
500|$|Describing Winslet in a 2015 {{article for}} Elle, the {{journalist}} Sally Holmes wrote that [...] "she {{has the kind}} of personality that puts an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> at ease, dropping F-bombs and self-deprecating remarks intermittently, while charming everyone with that buttery English accent". Jo Ellison of Vogue writes that she has an [...] "authoritative, almost ambassadorial aura", and Kira Cochrane of The Guardian considers her to be [...] "articulate, sophisticated, [...] a definite hint of grandeur". Describing Winslet as [...] "unfiltered, frank, sometimes blunt", Krista Smith of Vanity Fair believes that despite her stardom she exhibits [...] "a refreshing lack of pretension".|$|E

500|$|The crew {{investigated}} Logue's former consultation rooms, {{but they}} were too small to film in. Instead, they found a high, vaulted room not far away in 33 Portland Place. Eve Stewart, the production designer, liked the mottled, peeling wallpaper there {{so much that she}} recreated the effect throughout the <b>entire</b> <b>room.</b> In his DVD commentary, Hooper said he liked Portland Place as a set because it felt [...] "lived-in", unlike other period houses in London. The scenes of the Duke of York at home with his family were also filmed here; showing the Prince living in a townhouse [...] "subverted" [...] expectations of a royal drama.|$|E

500|$|Fuming was an {{accidental}} discovery in England {{after it was}} noticed that oak boards stored in a stable had darkened. [...] This {{was caused by the}} ammonia fumes from the horse urine reacting with the wood. [...] At {{the end of the nineteenth}} and beginning of the twentieth centuries fuming became popular with furniture makers in the Arts and Crafts movement. [...] The technique was introduced to the US by Gustav Stickley in 1901 and a manufacturing technique was perfected in the mission style furniture line of the Stickley family business. [...] Stickley also described a method of fuming the wooden architecture of an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> by setting down bowls of ammonia within the room and completely sealing it. [...] This method was not very practical and quite dangerous for the person placing the ammonia without the personal protective equipment available to modern workers. [...] Stickley was quickly followed by other American Arts and Crafts furniture makers [...] such as Charles Limbert and the Roycroft community.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} also {{influential}} in advancing {{the status of}} women, who were admitted singly without escorts. Boldt's wife, Louise, was influential in evolving {{the idea of the}} grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events, or just to be seen in the Peacock Alley. The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies-only parlor and provided women with a place to play billiards and ping-pong. [...] It was the first New York hotel to allocate an <b>entire</b> <b>room</b> for afternoon tea. [...] The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large, both the Empire Room and at times, the Rose Room, had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests. [...] Men were admitted to the teas only if they were {{in the company of a}} woman.|$|E
