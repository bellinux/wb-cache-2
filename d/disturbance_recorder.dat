Global positioning system-synchronised phasor measurement units and frequency <b>disturbance</b> <b>recorders</b> (FDRs) make power system dynamics visible and deliver an accurate picture of the overall operation condition to system operators. However, in the actual field implementations, some measurement data can be inaccessible for various reasons, for example, most notably failure of communication.

Specifically, a correlation coefficient index is proposed to describe the correlation relationship between different measurements. Then, the auto-regressive with exogenous input identification model is employed to estimate the missing system dynamic response. The US Eastern Interconnection is utilised in this study as a case study. The robustness of the correlation approach is verified by {{a wide variety of}} case studies as well.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{synchronized}} wide-area frequency measurements obtained from frequency <b>disturbance</b> <b>recorders</b> and phasor measurement units has presented the power industry with special opportunities to study power system dynamics. I propose {{the use of}} wide-area frequency measurements in identifying system disturbances based on power system post-event modal properties. In this work, power system dynamics are examined from an internal system energy viewpoint. Since an electric power system is composed of coupled rotating machines (large generators) which have air gap magnetic fields that are essentially static, or quasi-static, the power system may be modeled as a system with energy stored in quasi-static magnetic fields. The magnetic fields in the machines do change with time but may be modeled as static as far as wave propagation is concerned. The dynamic model that I develop treats this magnetic energy specifically as potential energy. Each rotating machine also contains an inertia due to the mass and motion of its rotor train and so each machine contains a rotational kinetic energy. Thus the internal system energy fo...|$|R
40|$|Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) {{utilizing}} synchrophasor measurements {{is considered}} one of the essential parts in smart grids that enable system operators to monitor, operate, and control power systems in wide geographical area. On the other hand, high-speed, reliable and scalable data communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of WAMS. Universal mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), the 3 G standard for mobile communication networks, was developed to provide high speed data transmission with reliable service performance for mobile users. Therefore, UMTS is considered a promising solution for providing a communication infrastructure for WAMS. 3 G based EWAMS (Egyptian wide area Monitoring System) is designed and implemented in Egypt through deployment a number of frequency <b>disturbance</b> <b>recorders</b> (FDRs) devices on a live 220 kV/ 500 kV Egyptian grid in cooperation with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The developed EWAMS can gather information from 11 FDRs devices which are geographically dispersed throughout the boundary of the Egyptian power grid and to a remote data management center located at Helwan University. The communication performance for the developed EWAMS in terms of communication time delay, throughput, and percentage of wasted bandwidth are studied in this paper. The results showed that the system can achieve successfully the communication requirements needed by various wide area monitoring applications.

The frequency <b>disturbance</b> <b>recorder</b> (FDR) in FNET is ac-tually a single-phase phasor measurement unit (PMU) installed at ordinary 120 V outlets {{in the sense that}} it measures the voltage phase angle, amplitude, and frequency from a single-phase voltage source. Based on the data collected by the FDRs deployed in the North American power grid, two islanding detection methods, the frequency difference method and the change of angle difference method, are proposed. The nine real cases recorded, including is-landing cases, generation trip cases, load shedding cases and os-cillation cases, are presented to verify the proposed methods of is-landing detection. Sensitivity analysis on the thresholds of the fre-quency deviation and angle deviation is done based on the realmea-surement data for obtaining the insensitive interval of two thresh-olds. The results show that the proposed methods can correctly de-tect power system islanding, and will not be falsely triggered by generation trips, load shedding and system oscillations.

One is the measurement from devices such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) [8] and digital fault recorders from high voltage levels, and frequency <b>disturbance</b> <b>recorder</b> (FDR) [9, 10] and PMU Lights [11] from low voltage levels. The measured frequency reveals the actual dynamic behaviour of power systems. However, without the knowledge of event type and location, system frequency behaviour can hardly be examined with the measured frequency. In most situations, power systems are operated in ambient mode with little frequency deviation. Dynamic behaviour of frequency with large frequency deviation can be rarely observed. Therefore, the frequency dynamic behaviour can hardly be studied using measurement data.|$|E

The collapse investigated in this paper was captured on December 2 nd, 2006, with an FDR unit installed at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU).

Comprehensive simulation results show how the models are capable of representing the most important features of the collapse of the system, and hence, their continuous improvement through model validation may allow their use in the development of load shedding mechanisms which are needed for mitigating cascading failures in the Nigerian system.
