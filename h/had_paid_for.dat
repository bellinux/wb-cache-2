5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> {{the first six months of}} school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|This {{first became}} {{evident in the}} great {{campaign}} to re-elect Gladstone. Known today as the Midlothian campaign, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for Midlothian, near to Rosebery's Dalmeny estate. Gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his Greenwich seat in 1874, when Disraeli had been swept to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign. The Tories were later to claim that Rosebery <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> Gladstone's campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.|$|E
5|$|According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995 {{he began}} {{receiving}} telephone calls from fans {{who said they}} <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette {{on the night of}} March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential {{to the success of the}} clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

5|$|Crowley soon progressed {{through the}} lower grades of the Golden Dawn, {{and was ready}} to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his {{bisexuality}} and libertine lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including W.B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders, Crowley – {{with the help of his}} mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.|$|E

25|$|In May 1939, {{as part of}} {{his efforts}} to bully Turkey into joining the Axis, Ribbentrop had {{arranged}} for the cancellation of the delivery of 60 heavy howitzers from the Škoda Works, which the Turks <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> in advance. The German refusal either to deliver the artillery pieces or refund the 125 million Reichsmarks that the Turks <b>had</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> them was to be a major strain on German-Turkish relations in 1939 and had the effect of causing Turkey's politically powerful army to resist Ribbentrop's entreaties to join the Axis. As part of the fierce diplomatic competition in Ankara {{in the spring and summer}} of 1939 between von Papen on the one hand, and on the other hand the French Ambassador, René Massigli, and the British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, to win the allegiance of Turkey to either the Axis or the Allies, Ribbentrop suffered a major reversal in July 1939 when Massigli was able to arrange for major French arms shipments to Turkey on credit to replace the weapons that the Germans had refused to deliver to the Turks.|$|E
