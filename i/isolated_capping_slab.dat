40|$|The {{completion}} of germination in Lepidium sativum and other endospermic seeds (e. g. Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana]) is regulated by two opposing forces, the growth {{potential of the}} radicle (RAD) and the resistance to this growth from the micropylar endosperm cap (CAP) surrounding it. We show by puncture force measurement that the CAP progressively weakens during germination, and we have conducted a time-course transcript analysis of RAD and CAP tissues throughout this process. We have also used specific inhibitors to investigate the importance of transcription, translation, and posttranslation levels of regulation of endosperm weakening in <b>isolated</b> <b>CAPs.</b> Although the impact of inhibiting translation is greater, both transcription and translation are required for the {{completion of}} endosperm weakening in the whole seed population. The majority of genes expressed during this process occur in both tissues, but where they are uniquely expressed, or significantly differentially expressed between tissues, this relates to {{the functions of the}} RAD as growing tissue and the CAP as a regulator of germination through weakening. More detailed analysis showed that putative orthologs of cell wall-remodeling genes are expressed in a complex manner during CAP weakening, suggesting distinct roles in the RAD and CAP. Expression patterns are also consistent with the CAP being a receptor for environmental signals influencing germination. Inhibitors of the aspartic, serine, and cysteine proteases reduced the number of <b>isolated</b> <b>CAPs</b> in which weakening developed, and inhibition of the 26 S proteasome resulted in its complete cessation. This indicates that targeted protein degradation is a major control point for endosperm weakening...|$|R

40|$|Polyspecific {{antibodies}} {{bound to}} the cell surface of Entamoeba histolytica are polarized toward the uroid region and spontaneously released by the amoeba as supramolecular aggregate or cap. We purified these exfoliated structures and analyzed them by electron microscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. <b>Isolated</b> <b>caps</b> were mainly com-posed of membranes and contained five major [35 S]methionine-Iabeled bands; many more bands appeared (together with immunoglobulins) after silver staining. Surface im-munoprecipitates contained about twelve major [35 S]methionine-Iabeled polypeptides, five of which had molecular weights {{similar to those of}} radiolabeled polypeptides in the cap. Some proteins in the caps had the same electrophoretic migration pattern as that from iodinated cell-surface proteins and polypeptides from isolated plasma membranes. Results suggest that only half of the surface-immunoprecipitated antigens are enriched in the cap. Entamoeba histolytica segregates most of the anti-bodies [1, 2] and concanavalin A [3] bound to its surface. Immune complexes that accumulate in the cap are spontaneously released as a membrane frag-ment, without damage to the amoeba [4]. It is pos-sible that polarization of surface antigens could in-terfere with complement-mediated killing of the parasite [5 - 7]. This fact could partially explain why patients with amoebic liver abscesses have high titers of antibody [8], while trophozoites remain active and produce tissue damage. To understand some of the mechanisms involved in the amoeba-antibody inter-action, we wanted to identify the major surface antigens of the amoeba that are recognized immuno-logically and to determine which components could mediate an effective immune rejection.

40|$|Vg 1 is a {{maternal}} mRNA localized to the vegetal hemisphere of Xenopus embryos during blastula stages, {{a region}} {{responsible for the}} induction of mesoderm in the adjacent marginal zone. Its homology to the transforming growth factor-beta family, which includes several proteins with mesoderm-inducing activity, suggests a role for Vg 1 as an endogenous mesoderm-inducing factor. However, expression of Vg 1 protein in the animal hemisphere, following injection of synthetic mRNA, {{has no effect on}} development, and <b>isolated</b> animal <b>caps</b> are not mesodermalized. It is shown that Vg 1 protein fails to form dimers and is not processed to release the putative bioactive domain. Furthermore it is shown that the N-terminal signal peptide of Vg 1 is not cleaved following translocation into the ER, which may explain the failure of this protein to dimerize. To explore the role of Vg 1 in amphibian development, a fusion protein has been made of the preproregion of Xenopus bone morphogenetic protein- 4 and the putative bioactive C-terminal domain of Vg 1. This fusion protein forms dimers and the C-terminal domain of Vg 1 is secreted.

The outer surface protein BB 0689 from B. burgdorferi is up-regulated when the tick feeds, which indicates a potential role for BB 0689 in Lyme disease pathogenesis. We have determined the crystal structure of BB 0689, which revealed that the protein belongs to the CAP superfamily. Though the CAP domain is widespread in all three cellular domains of life, thus far the CAP domain has been studied only in eukaryotes, {{in which it is}} usually linked to certain other domains to form a multi-domain protein and is associated with the mammalian reproductive tract, the plant response to pathogens, venom allergens from insects and reptiles, and the growth of human brain tumors.

40|$|The sudden, {{widespread}} glaciation of Antarctica and {{the associated}} shift toward colder temperatures near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (∼ 34 Ma) {{represents one of the}} most fundamental reorganizations of the global climate system recognized in the geologic record. This glacial inception and the subsequent evolution of the early East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) are simulated using a new, coupled global climate–dynamical ice sheet model accounting for the paleogeography, greenhouse gas concentrations, changing orbital parameters, and varying ocean heat transport. Suites of long (105 yr) climate–ice sheet simulations are used to investigate the effects of declining atmospheric CO 2, compared to those of the tectonic opening of Southern Ocean gateways and the timing of mountain uplift in the Antarctic interior. In contrast to the established paradigm for the glaciation of Antarctica, which centers on the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and the ‘thermal isolation’ of the continent, our results show that declining Cenozoic pCO 2 may have played the dominant role. First, small <b>isolated</b> ice <b>caps</b> formed on the highest Antarctic plateaus. Then, as a CO 2 threshold between ∼ 3 × and 2 × pre-industrial level (PAL) was crossed, height–mass balance feedbacks were initiated during orbital periods with cold austral summers, triggering much larger, highly dynamic terrestrial ice sheets. As CO 2 continued to decline, these <b>isolated</b> ice <b>caps</b> eventually merged into a permanent continental-scale EAIS. In our model, neither the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways nor mountain uplift significantly affected the timing of the major ice sheet transition, given a scenario of gradually declining CO 2 from 4 × to 2 × PAL over 10 million years around the Eocene–Oligocene boundary...|$|R
