25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> Vagrant Story as a title that demands to be in English and thought of his work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an English-speaking audience. He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a British accent to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Harrison sings {{of how he}} values Dylan's friendship, {{together}} with [...] "the tales you have told me / From {{the things that you}} saw". For much of his career, Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan as one of his biggest musical influences, along with Ravi Shankar. To Inglis, these verse-two lines reflect the level of Harrison's respect for his work, since [...] "while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> Dylan".|$|E
500|$|The marble statue {{is located}} on Indiana Avenue NW, {{in front of the}} old District of Columbia City Hall in the Judiciary Square neighborhood. [...] It {{measures}} [...] high [...] wide while the granite base measures [...] high and [...] wide. [...] The statue portrays Abraham Lincoln standing, wearing a long coat with a bow tie and waistcoat. [...] His left hand rests on a fasces while his right arm is by his side. [...] Lincoln's partially open right hand points to the ground as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> his left. [...] The right hand was replaced at some point and the new one is considered too large to scale. [...] A sword or scroll previously hung by his right side, but is now missing. [...] The two-tiered base consists of a rectangle on top of a lower square-shaped foundation.|$|E

Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the west, and cleared his throat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> north and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> south, and each time he cleared his throat, but said nothing. Finally he folded his hands once more over his white and yellow waistcoat, and looking {{straight}} up at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun he remarked in his very deepest Voice and {{to no one in}} particular: ...|$|R
500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues {{that it is a}} waste of time since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
500|$|... {{named after}} Konohagakure, is the {{grandson}} of the Third Hokage. He strives to replace his grandfather as Hokage so the villagers of Konohagakure will recognize him by name, not simply as the Hokage's grandson. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the Rasengan and the Sexy Jutsu among {{a variety of other}} techniques. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first. By the events of the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is currently captain of Team Konohamaru. Konohamaru's design caused great difficulties for Masashi Kishimoto; he intended for Konohamaru to look like a [...] "punk" [...] smaller than Naruto, yet all of his attempts resulted in a mere recreation of Naruto. He eventually gave Konohamaru small, angry-looking eyes, and was instantly happy with the design. While voiced in the Japanese anime by Ikue Ōtani, and by Akiko Koike as a stand-in, Konohamaru's adult self is voiced by Hidenori Takahashi. In the English version, Colleen O'Shaughnessey voices Konohamaru's pre-adult self, and Max Mittelman voices Konohamaru's adult self.|$|E
500|$|Green Day's {{sound is}} often {{compared}} to first wave punk rock bands {{such as the}} Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as [...] "punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs." [...] While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned {{that some of his}} biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's [...] "Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely" [...] as a b-side to the [...] "Warning" [...] single, and the character [...] "Mr. Whirly" [...] in the group's song [...] "Misery" [...] is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Kinks, The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song [...] "Wonderwall" [...] with its song [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".|$|E

500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E
500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>to</b> heaven, we may believe, because <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> God the Father; to God, of {{whom the}} glorious collect tells us, {{that he is}} more ready to hear than we to pray, and is wont to give more than either we desire or deserve. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>to</b> the Father, who is the {{fountain}} of life, of order, of health, of usefulness; who hates all death, disease, infirmity; who wills that none should perish, body or soul.|$|R

2500|$|In ancient Roman {{religion}} and myth, Janus ( [...] ; , [...] ) is {{the god of}} beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the future and to the past. It is conventionally thought that the month of January is named for Janus (Ianuarius), but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs Juno was the tutelary deity of the month.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theology}} of justification as teached by John Owen {{was used by}} the Dutch minister [...] of Woubrugge in his own polemics agains what he saw as Dutch neonomians. Just as Owen, Comrie stresses the point that before God gives faith to the sinner, <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the merits of Christ. It is because of the merits of Christ that the sinner receives the gift of faith to believe in Christ for salvation. For Comrie, Owen was a theological authority who he could well use for his own {{theology of}} justification by faith.|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{references}} to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the right hand of God in God's heavenly court, a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen {{is filled with the}} [...] "holy spirit" [...] <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the Gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a college}} player {{he took the}} {{nickname}} [...] "The Jewish Hammer" [...] or [...] "The Hammer". [...] He explains that as The Hebrew Hammer was taken [...] "they {{had to come up}} with something else", and that the [...] "hammer" [...] aspect refers to his penchant for throwing opposing players down on the field. [...] A more recent nickname, following his being picked by the Chicago Bears, is [...] "The Bear Jew", a reference to a character in the 2009 film [...] "Inglourious Basterds". [...] One of his favorite Jewish football players was a former Badger, Matt Bernstein, and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> 49ers former offensive linesman Harris Barton as a role model.|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson {{says that}} he looks {{everywhere}} for inspiration and is always sketching. He adds that he is [...] "never bored", and that just {{walking down the street}} one can find inspiration from [...] "things on the sidewalk, the type of tiles, the paintings on the signs, there's always something to inspire you". His McLaren office is full of toys. Stephenson says of this: [...] "that's the nature of any designer, you'll find they have a toy shop around". He also says that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the animal kingdom for design, using what's called biomimicry. Having a deep passion for biology and evolution, he tries to [...] "find the principles in nature that makes products do what they look like they do".|$|E
