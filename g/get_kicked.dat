2500|$|In June 1972, Title IX of the [...] "Education Amendments Act of 1972" [...] was passed, and {{it brought}} the {{beginning}} of the most significant change in the history of Alpha Kappa Psi. [...] Title IX prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While social fraternities and sororities were exempt from the provisions of Title IX, professional fraternities were included in Title IX. Around this time, the brothers of the Delta Chi Chapter at Clarkson University introduced legislation to amend Alpha Kappa Psi's Constitution to include women as brothers. While this move did gain the support of a few other chapters, the proposed amendments were easily defeated. [...] In the fall of 1973, the Delta Chi chapter admitted four women into their Chapter and soon granted females full rights and privileges, including participation in ritual. [...] Delta Chi went on to elect a female president and attempted to send her to the 1974 national convention as their voting delegate. [...] As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi revoked the charter of the Delta Chi Chapter. The chapter proceeded by changing its name to Delta Chi Delta aiming to be completely independent from its former counterpart. During the same year, the Alpha Kappa Chapter at the University of Idaho also admitted women to membership. As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi also moved forward with disciplinary action against the Alpha Kappa Chapter. Upon having their charter revoked, the former Alpha Kappa Chapter continued on as an independent organization known as Pi Beta Sigma, and the organization's advisor remarked [...] "My sentiments are that if we are being excommunicated from the national because we failed to discriminate against women, then it's a pleasure to <b>get</b> <b>kicked</b> out of that organization.|$|E
