5|$|During {{the nearby}} Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the North Korean People's Army {{broke through the}} US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the NK 9th Division and NK 4th Division {{attacked}} to Yongsan, a village east {{of the river and}} the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a fight between North Korean and US forces for Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> an infamous footnote in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Han dynasty in 220, China {{disintegrated}} into warlord states, {{which in}} 280 were briefly reunited under the Western Jin dynasty (265316). There are ambiguous accounts of the Jin rebuilding the Qin wall, but these walls apparently offered no resistance during the Wu Hu uprising, when the nomadic tribes of the steppe evicted the Chinese court from northern China. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a succession of short-lived states in northern China known as the Sixteen Kingdoms, until they were all consolidated by the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty (386535).|$|E

5|$|On 11 August, Task Force Bradley {{struck out}} from Yongil Airfield to counterattack the North Korean forces around P'ohang-dong while Task Force P'ohang {{attacked}} from An'gang-ni area. Both forces immediately met resistance from North Korean forces. By that time, the North Korean forces had captured P'ohang-dong. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a complicated series of fights through the large region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by U.S. air forces engaged groups of North Korean forces operation {{all around the}} vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{subsequently}} {{planned a}} simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around {{the cities of}} Masan, Kyongju, Taegu, Yongch'on and the Naktong Bulge. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> two weeks of extremely brutal fighting as the two sides vied to control the routes into Pusan. Initially successful in some areas, the North Koreans were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force. The North Korean army, again stalled at the failure of this offensive, was subsequently destroyed in the UN counterattack at Inchon.|$|E
5|$|The {{match that}} <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> Melina versus Mickie James for the WWE Women's Championship. The match was short lived, as Melina {{performed}} an Inverted DDT upon Mickie James and pinned her {{to retain the}} WWE Women's Championship. The third match was between Chris Benoit and Montel Vontavious Porter for the WWE United States Championship. Benoit and MVP struggled throughout the match, attempting to gain the upper hand. In the end, Benoit pinned MVP {{after a series of}} counters from both superstars, culminating in a small package to win the match and retain the WWE United States Championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{match that}} <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a Fatal 4-Way Match for the WWE Women's Championship, with Victoria {{defending}} the title against Trish Stratus, Lita, and Gail Kim. The {{start of the}} match saw Victoria and Lita double team Stratus, however, Stratus avoided the assault, as she rolled out of the ring. Lita and Victoria went on to double team Kim, however, Stratus pulled Lita out of the ring, afterward Victoria performed a moonsault and landed on Kim's torso. Lita then drove Kim's head into the mat. Stratus {{then went on to}} use a roll up on Lita to gain a pinfall victory, becoming Women's champion for a fifth time.|$|E
5|$|The {{match that}} <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> between Shawn Michaels and Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho. The {{start of the}} match saw Michaels and Jericho {{exchange}} several near-falls attempts before Michaels applied a modified figure four leglock, which Jericho broke free. Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho but Michaels grabbed the bottom rope, causing Jericho to break the hold. Jericho attempted the Walls of Jericho again, but Michaels countered into a straddle pin to take the win. After the match, both men shook hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> {{a border}} war in 1277â€“78. It was {{reported}} {{mainly in the}} Yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of Marco Polo. Although the Burmese chronicles have no record of the border war, a 1278 Burmese inscription mentions the army's defeat at Ngasaunggyan. The Mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate.|$|E
5|$|What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> {{a two-week}} battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} North Koreans were able to {{gradually}} push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the North Koreans {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the North Koreans were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E

5|$|What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> another {{relatively}} disappointing {{season at}} Bondi Junction, with the Roosters finishing 11th in a 2011 season plagued by off-field issues involving 2010 Dally M Medallist Todd Carney (who was later sacked by the Roosters at season's end). However, a four-game winning streak {{to end the}} season brought hope for the 2012 season. Other high-profile players including Nate Myles, Mark Riddell, Jason Ryles, Kane Linnett and Phil Graham all left the club at season's end.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} groups of {{personnel}} began arriving at Redbank, in south-east Queensland, {{in the middle}} of May, the battalion's headquarters moved to the camp and basic training commenced in June under instructors from the Australian Instructional Corps. In early July, the majority of the battalion was transported by train to Pinkenba, and from there to Darwin, in Australia's north, aboard the troopship Zealandia. Tasked with defending the port and its surrounds, the battalion was based around Vestey's meatworks near Mindil Beach, and in the months that <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> occupied with vital asset protection and area defence in between individual and collective training exercises. Personnel were joined by the majority of their vehicles, including 14 tracked Bren carriers in August, as well as a group of reinforcements. In October, elements of the battalion were used as stevedores during a wharf labourers' strike.|$|E
5|$|At the time, John was in {{south-east}} England recruiting mercenaries {{in preparation}} for his war with the barons. Rochester blocked the direct route to London, which was also held by the rebels. According to Roger of Wendover, the rebels at Rochester were led by William d'Aubigny, lord of Belvoir. Estimates {{of the size of}} Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing the news that the city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13October. Royal forces had arrived ahead of John and entered the city on 11October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> the largest in England up to that point, and would take nearly two months.|$|E

5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two decades of the 16th century, the Spanish {{established}} their domination over the islands of the Caribbean Sea, and used these as a staging point to launch their campaigns of conquest on the continental mainland of the Americas. From Hispaniola, the Spanish launched expeditions and campaigns of conquest, reaching Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica in 1509, Cuba in 1511, and Florida in 1513. The Spanish heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland {{to the west of}} their Caribbean island settlements and, in 1519, HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s set sail to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. The Spanish conquered a large part of Mexico within three years, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. The conquest of Central America that <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> effectively an extension of the campaign that overthrew the Aztec Empire.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by WaÅ‚Ä™sa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that <b>followed</b> <b>was</b> conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
