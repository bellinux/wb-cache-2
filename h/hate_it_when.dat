500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he {{was initially}} skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. [...] "It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... I just <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|During season finales, a song {{is played}} before the closing {{scene in a}} montage showing {{the lives of the}} protagonists in the {{aftermath}} of the narrative. The first season montage is played over [...] "Step by Step" [...] by Jesse Winchester, the second [...] "I Feel Alright" [...] by Steve Earle, the third [...] "Fast Train" [...] written by Van Morrison and performed by Solomon Burke, the fourth [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] written by Dr. John and performed by Paul Weller and the fifth uses an extended version of [...] "Way Down In The Hole" [...] by the Blind Boys of Alabama, the same version of the song used as the opening theme for the first season. While the songs reflect the mood of the sequence, their lyrics are usually only loosely tied to the visual shots. In the commentary track to episode 37, [...] "Mission Accomplished", executive producer David Simon said: [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> somebody purposely tries to have the lyrics match the visual. It brutalizes the visual in a way to have the lyrics dead on point.... Yet at the same time it can't be totally off point. It has to glance at what you're trying to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the incident, Gershom Gorenberg, of {{the liberal}} {{magazine}} The American Prospect, stated [...] "CAMERA is ready to exempt itself from the demands for accuracy that it aims at the media. And like others engaged in the narrative wars, it does not {{understand the difference between}} advocacy and accuracy." [...] Gorenberg criticized CAMERA for telling members not to share information about the campaign with media, and he also argued Ini's definition of accuracy [...] "only means not printing anything embarrassing to his own side". David Shamah, of The Jerusalem Post, stated that [...] "the vast anti-Israel lobby that haters of our country have managed to pull together" [...] <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> groups like CAMERA mess up [...] "their anti-Israel propaganda with (gasp!) facts".|$|E
2500|$|Julius Root {{commanded}} the reconnaissance {{branch of the}} LEP, and {{was in charge of}} all activities related to the tracking of those who leave fairy civilization, to prevent them making contact with humans. Known for his ruddy face (hence his nickname, [...] "Beetroot") and extremely short temper, he led the LEPrecon on missions until Koboi killed him using an explosive in The Opal Deception and framed Holly Short. He taught Holly to do what is right, even if it means to stop being a LEP captain and instead become a major, being confined to deskwork. However, Root also {{seems to have been a}} lot like Holly Short when he was younger; a book states that Holly Short had recently beat the speed record, a speed record that had been set 500 years ago by Julius Root. Julius Root seemed to <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> Foaly called him by his first name. Julius Root also had a brother, Turnball Root, who was the main antagonist for the seventh book.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1992, Morrissey {{released}} the album Your Arsenal, which peaked at number 2 in the album chart. It {{was the final}} release from producer Mick Ronson; Morrissey related that working with Ronson had been [...] "the greatest privilege of my life". Your Arsenal reflected Morrissey's lament for what he regarded as the decline of British culture {{in the face of}} increasing Americanisation. He told one interviewer that [...] "everything is informed by American culture - everyone under fifty speaks American - and that's sad. We once had a strong identity and now that's gone completely". A number of the tracks on the album, most notably [...] "Certain People I Know" [...] and [...] "The National Front Disco", dealt with the lives and experiences of tough, working-class youths. Your Arsenal was critically well received, and often described as his best album since Viva Hate. The first single, [...] "We <b>Hate</b> <b>It</b> <b>When</b> Our Friends Become Successful", had been released in April 1992 and peaked at number 17; this was followed by [...] "Certain People I Know", which reached number 34, and [...] "You're the One for Me, Fatty", which reached number 19. From September to December, Morrissey embarked on a 53-date Your Arsenal tour in which he varyingly decorated the stage with backdrops of Diana Dors, Elvis Presley, and Charlie Richardson. One of the performances was recorded and released as Beethoven Was Deaf.|$|E

2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
