40|$|Abstract—Piezoelectric bending {{actuators}} are {{an attractive}} option for driving microrobots {{due to their}} light weight, scalability, ease of integration, and high bandwidth. However, the only existing energy or power output measurements for piezoelectric bending actuators have been extrapolated from dc values or unloaded ac values, and are most likely overestimates. For microrobot applications such as flapping flight, accurate measures of power density are critical for design variables. In this paper, to properly measure the energy output of a 10 -mg piezoelectric actuator, a custom dynamometer is designed and constructed to directly measure the power output at various frequencies and conditions. The dynamometer can simulate resonance with a tunable resistive (damping) load at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz. It was found that due to low internal damping and fracture limits, actuators cannot be run in the damping matched condition at high fields (> 1 V/µm). Using the device, energy output per cycle at a drive field of 1. 6 V/µmwas measured to be a maximum of 19. 1 µJ/cycle (232 -µm amplitude, 30 Hz), giving a delivered energy density per cycle of 1. 89 J/kg. Internal actuator damping was measured at 1 V/µm to account for an energy loss of only 0. 21 µJ per cycle (232 -µm amplitude, 30 Hz). These results are the first measurement of real power output of a piezoelectric bending actuator operating in real-world conditions (at ac and driven by high fields), and demonstrate power output measurement techniques that are applicable to other <b>miniature</b> <b>actuators</b> that are designed for operation in resonance.

40|$|Reduced access size in {{minimally}} invasive surgery and therapy (MIST) poses several restriction {{on the design of}} the dexterous robotic instruments. The instruments should be developed that are slender enough to pass through the small sized incisions and able to effectively operate in a compact workspace. Most existing robotic instruments are operated by big actuators, located outside the patient’s body, that transfer forces to the end effector via cables or magnetically controlled actuation mechanism. These instruments are certainly far from optimal in terms of their cost and the space they require in operating room. The lack of adequate sensing technologies make it very challenging to measure bending of the flexible instruments, and to measure tool-tissue contact forces of the both flexible and rigid instruments during MIST. Therefore, it requires the development of the cost effective <b>miniature</b> <b>actuators</b> and strain/force sensors. Having several unique features such as bio-compatibility, low cost, light weight, large actuation forces and electrical resistivity variations, the shape memory alloys (SMAs) show promising applications both as the actuators and strain sensors in MIST. However, highly nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the SMAs hinders their use as actuators. To overcome this problem, an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) based Preisach model and a model predictive controller have been developed in this thesis to precisely control the output of the SMA actuators.

In this paper, a new control methodology is presented for a morphing wing demonstrator tested in a subsonic wind tunnel in the open-loop configuration. Actuators integrated inside the wing are used to modify the flexible structure, which {{is an integral part}} of the wing. In this project, the actuators are made in-house and controlled with logic control, which is developed within the main frame of this work. The characterization of the flow (laminar or turbulent) over the wing is obtained starting from the pressure signals measured over the flexible part of the wing (upper surface). The signals are acquired by using some pressure sensors (Kulite sensors) incorporated in this flexible part of the wing upper surface. The technique used to collect Kulite pressure data and the post-processing methodology are explained. The recorded pressure data are sometimes subjected to noise, which is filtered before being processed. The standard deviation and power spectrum visualization of the pressure data approaches are used to evaluate the quality of the flow over the wing and estimate the transition point position in the area monitored by the Kulite sensors. In addition, infrared thermography visualization is implemented to observe the transition region over the entire wing upper surface, and to validate the methodology applied to the pressure data in this way.

Currently, they are mainly used in applications {{in the form of}} films. Thin PVDF films have been shown to possess unique ferroelectric properties in the nanoscale range. However, their two-dimensional nature limits their applicability in active engineering materials and structures. One-dimensional PVDF nanofibers can be expected to combine ferroelectric behavior with enhanced mechanical properties and ultrahigh flexibility providing critical advantages for applications. In this work, novel continuous PVDF nanofibers were nanomanufactured and systematically studied for the first time. Nanofibers from PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer with several molecular weights and co-polymer compositions were manufactured by electrospinning. The method consists of spinning polymer solutions in high electric fields. Effects of process parameters on nanofiber diameters and morphology were studied. Resulting nanofibers were characterized by FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, DSC and TGA. Effects of annealing on copolymer nanofibers were analyzed. Nanofiber-reinforced composites were manufactured and their polarization behavior studied using a specially designed experimental device. A number of pioneering observations and discoveries were made {{as a result of this}} analysis. For example, analysis of crystalline structure of PVDF nanofibers showed that the initial a phase of the PVDF raw material was converted to β phase during electrospinning. This result is very encouraging as the β phase is primarily responsible for the piezo- and ferroelectric behavior of PVDF polymers. It was also shown for the first time that nanofabricated P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers exhibited distinct Curie points and different structures than their raw materials. Annealing was shown to be an effective way to modify properties of P(VDF-TrFE) co-polymer nanofibers. ^ Overall, the results demonstrated for the first time flexible nanomanufacturing of continuous PVDF and co-polymer nanofibers exhibiting a number of unusual ferroelectric properties.

Actuator displacements needed for complete cancellation of the propagating acoustic response modes have been determined, along with the associated actuator power requirements. As an alternative, weighted least squares minimization of the total far-field sound power using individual actuators has also been examined. Attempts were made to translate the two-dimensional aerodynamic results into three-dimensional actuator requirements. The results lie near the limit of present actuator technology. In order to investigate the concept of noise control at the source for active rotor/stator noise control at the source, various techniques for embedding <b>miniature</b> <b>actuators</b> into vanes were examined. Numerous miniature speaker arrangements were tested and analyzed to determine their suitability as actuators for a demonstration test in the Annular Cascade Facility at Purdue. The best candidates demonstrated marginal performance. An alternative concept to using vane mounted speakers as control actuators was developed and tested. The concept uses compression drivers which are mounted externally to the stator vanes. Each compression driver is connected via a tube to an air cavity in the stator vane, from which the driver signal radiates into the working section of the experimental rig. The actual locations and dimensions of the actuators were used as input parameters for a LINFLO computational analysis of the actuator displacements required for complete cancellation of tones in the Purdue experimental rig. The actuators were designed and an arrangement determined which {{is compatible with the}} Purdue experimental rig and instrumentation. Experimental tests indicate that the actuators are capable of producing equivalent displacements greater than the requirements predicted by the LINFLO analysis.

For instance, in drug delivery area, such release system offers numerous advantages compared to conventional dosage drug forms including improved efficiency, reduced toxicity and controlled release profile. Current challenges in this area include biocompatiblity and biodegrability of the materials used in the system, controllablity and effectivity of the control mechanism, easiness of device fabraiction and drug loading loss as well as total cost. In this work, a simple and effective method is adopted to design and fabricate controlled release devices employing smart conmtrol mechanism. Such a technology could be further applied in pharmaceutics, biomeidical science and biotechnologies. Controlled molecule release devices in this work employ the advantage of core-shell structures. In the first design, core-shell microcapsules are developed capable of regulating the release profile of encapsulated molecules. These microcapsules uniquely contain embedded <b>miniature</b> <b>actuators</b> inside their liquid core. The internal actuators are made of stimuli-responsive smart hydrogel beads. The embedded hydrogel beads swell in response to external electric fields, regulating the internal pressure of the liquid core, and thus the diffusion rate, of the encapsulated molecules from the microcapsules. The incorporation of the actuators into the interior of the microcapsules provides an internal control variable to a conventional diffusion-based release process. The microcapsules, which behave much like micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), are fabricated by a simple co-electrospray process. This fabrication technique allows integrating the hydrogel beads, forming the polymer shell, and loading the releasable molecules simultaneously in one step.
