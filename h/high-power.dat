5|$|A bus-powered hub is a <b>high-power</b> device {{providing}} low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a device that provides <b>high-power</b> ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all <b>high-power</b> ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for <b>high-power</b> laser diodes, laser arrays and <b>high-power</b> transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and <b>high-power</b> devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. <b>High-power</b> devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may not be available.|$|E
5|$|CFMI {{tested both}} a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the {{beginning}} of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed exhaust nozzle. Only the <b>high-power</b> CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust nozzle.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{transistors}} {{have been}} produced in the laboratory. They are functional at much higher temperatures than silicon devices, and are resistant to chemical and radiation damage. While no diamond transistors have yet been successfully integrated into commercial electronics, they are promising for use in exceptionally <b>high-power</b> situations and hostile non-oxidizing environments.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of <b>high-power</b> CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in <b>high-power</b> radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic infrared devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in <b>high-power</b> infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Low-power and <b>high-power</b> devices remain {{operational}} {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2– December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5A.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with <b>high-power</b> mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the voltage drops to 2V.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during <b>high-power</b> portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for <b>high-power</b> sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to disengage.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and <b>high-power</b> operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, <b>high-power</b> nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, <b>high-power</b> nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in <b>high-power</b> transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|No. 111 Squadron {{managed to}} get into {{position}} above Kenley at 3,000 feet. With luck they could intercept 9 Staffel. Biggin Hill soon took the same precaution of ordering all fighters into the air by order of Group Captain Richard Grice. At 13:10 the German bombers were within 40 miles of the BBC <b>high-power</b> transmitter at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. In accordance with policy, it was shut down to deny the Germans the opportunity {{to use it as}} direction-finding beacon and the BBC Home Service was kicked off air in the process. Using the railway lines, Roth, in the lead Do 17, homed in on Kenley from the south. They were now just six miles away.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{claims of}} diamond {{synthesis}} were documented between 1879 and 1928; {{most of those}} attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as detonation synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with <b>high-power</b> ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into <b>high-power</b> mode.|$|E
5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. <b>High-power</b> USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of <b>high-power</b> radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E

5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In <b>high-power</b> installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated <b>high-power</b> nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did <b>high-power</b> {{industrial}} lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype <b>high-power</b> switches for power stations.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a <b>high-power</b> reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for <b>high-power</b> switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the debris at the 10-megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test {{was a part of}} long-term project, {{one of the goals of}} which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in <b>high-power</b> nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm2·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary {{analysis of}} debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.|$|E

Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case.
