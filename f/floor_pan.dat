25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the Anti-Lock Braking System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the <b>floor</b> <b>pan)</b> are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stretched}} {{version of the}} Rover 75—initially called Vanden Plas, then simply Limousine—was introduced in 2002. Developed in conjunction with specialist vehicle builder [...] in Walsall, England, the model was stretched by 200mm in the rear <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> with longer rear doors. The extra length, and the fitment of the new premium grille were the only visual clues to the changes made. Available only in Connoisseur specification, production moved to Longbridge after an initial short run by the coach-building partner.|$|E

5000|$|Rust is {{an issue}} for the Montecarlo and Scorpion. [...] Unless kept in a dry {{environment}} active prevention is required to fend off rust. The firewall and wheel wells are common locations for rust. [...] Rusted <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> are {{a major cause of}} early Montecarlo/Scorpion demise.|$|R
2500|$|The Hornet, {{introduced}} for the 1951 model year, {{was based}} on Hudson's [...] "step-down" [...] design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. The design merged body and chassis frame into a single structure, with the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> recessed between the car's chassis rails instead of {{sitting on top of}} them. Thus one [...] "stepped down" [...] into a Hudson. The step-down chassis's [...] "lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish. The car not only handled well, but treated its six passengers to a sumptuous ride. The low-slung look also had a sleekness about it that was accentuated by the nearly enclosed rear wheels." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the arrival}} of the Mark II model, the saloon was renamed the Volkswagen Polo Classic and the [...] "conventional"-styled {{hatchback}} (with a sloping tailgate) was renamed as a coupé, the Volkswagen Polo Coupé. Unusually, the third (and new) body that was actually marketed as the Volkswagen Polo Hatchback was closer in concept to a small estate, albeit with exactly the same wheelbase and <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> as the coupé instead of the (longer) saloon. This latter version, also known as the squareback (in the original German brochures, [...] "steilheck", literally [...] "steep tail") amongst other nicknames was the most popular in virtually every country where the Polo was sold. Despite the differences in silhouette and target market segment, all body types were 2- or 3-door only.|$|E
2500|$|The Moke's {{construction}} is simple. The body mainly {{consists of two}} box-section [...] "pontoons" [...] or [...] "sideboxes" [...] running between {{the front and rear}} wheels, and include (non-hollow) extensions of that {{from the back of the}} car all the way up to the front. These are connected by the <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|E
50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} the carpets used in the interiors of cars. The molded carpet is designed to hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting carpet. The process of creating the molded carpet requires the original <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> and having the carpet laid upon the pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, easier to bend and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the <b>floor</b> <b>pans.</b> This helps prevent the carpet from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact the carpet. The jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R
5000|$|Considered a new {{platform}} by Ford Motor Company, D2C is {{loosely based}} on the Ford DEW platform which served {{as the basis for}} the Lincoln LS, Ford Thunderbird, and Jaguar S-Type. The 2005 S197 Mustang was originally designed to use a [...] "Lite" [...] version of the DEW98 platform, but while that plan was eventually scrapped as too expensive, most D2C platform development completed prior to that decision was retained. This led to the carryover of several DEW98 chassis components. These components include the <b>floor</b> <b>pans,</b> portions of the transmission tunnel, the front frame rails, and basic fuel tank design.|$|R
40|$|A LCA {{feasibility}} study was undertaken {{to determine the}} environmental impact of an Eco-magnesium process route by recycled chips to manufacture panel for the automotive sector to be compared with comparative scenarios, a non-recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and a baseline steel-made component scenario. The objective of this LCA study was to assess the actual benefits of a lightweight solution considering the whole life cycle, including the dirty-phase (i. e. the “cradle-to-exit gate” stage) that impacts differently for the different materials. For this reason the analysis has regarded the net “cradle-to-grave” scenario. Different automotive <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> were then compared considering the rate of fuel consumption during vehicle operation - i. e. the fuel-mass correlation factor - and the different material substitution factors allowed by the different materials selected...|$|R
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E

50|$|In {{line with}} the first-generation Escort, the EXP was {{produced}} in a version from 1982 to 1985, undergoing a facelift during the 1985 model year. The model was dropped after the 1988 model year. Although not intended to replace the EXP (as it was originally designed to become the 1989 Ford Mustang), the 1989 Ford Probe would become the next front-wheel drive sports coupe sold by Ford. After the EXP, the next two-seat Ford marketed in North America would be the 2002 Ford Thunderbird. Then in 1998 the Escort of the time was marketed as a ZX2, to help reel in consumers that favored the XR2 and the EXP from the 1980s. Although it was a sports car, it was common to remove the rear carpeting to put in rear seats as the <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> are identical between the 3-door Escorts, Escort GTs, and EXPs, however the lower roof line makes rear seating uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|People {{restoring}} classic {{cars will}} often freshen up the interior by putting in new carpet to cover new <b>floor</b> <b>pans.</b> When they do replace the carpet {{in their cars}} they have quite a few options in molded carpet. There are several websites that specialize in molded carpets. There are several styles of molded carpet, the most popular include 80-20 loop, cutpile and essex. Most cars from the 1940s to the mid-1970s used 80-20 loop carpet. The major exception being Cadillac which used cut pile in their cars at various times. After 1974 car makers used cut pile or essex carpet exclusively. 80-20 loop which is 80% rayon 20% nylon thus the name. It has a texture similar to berber house carpet. Cut pile is {{what you see in}} modern cars. It looks like little strands of hair. Essex is a longer more plush version of cut pile carpet. It's softer to the touch than cut pile and 80-20 loop, but is also more expensive than the other two.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} presented by this project was the <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> since in left hand drive, the driver had the most space available. The engine and gearbox offset had to be reversed with the use of Tickford engineered brackets, and unique <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> sections, to achieve the necessary space for the driver in RHD.

40|$|Excerpt] At 12 : 01 a. m., November 1, All Saints 2 ̆ 7 Day 1983, the Chrysler Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s {{stamping}} plant in Twinsburg, Ohio, suddenly fell silent. Members of United Auto Workers Local 122 shut down their machines for a strike. As the door panels, <b>floor</b> <b>pans,</b> {{and other parts}} they produce stopped flowing across the country from Twinsburg, {{the only source of}} supply for these parts, half a dozen Chrysler assembly plants fell silent too. In New York that night, on NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw called it a 2 ̆ 2 wildcat strike 2 ̆ 2 -—an unauthorized walkout. On the other coast, a Los Angeles Times editor changed the first paragraphs of the Detroit bureau 2 ̆ 7 s story, making it 2 ̆ 2 Robert Weissman 2 ̆ 7 s strike, 2 ̆ 2 a walkout 2 ̆ 2 almost singlehandedly 2 ̆ 2 engineered by Weissman, the president of the Twinsburg local union. The alterations made the story conform more closely with other coverage around the country, which implied that a pack of militants in Twinsburg was knocking Chrysler down just as the company was getting up off its knees. That was Chrysler 2 ̆ 7 s line on the strike, but it was just one way of looking at it. Weissman, a man who does not 2 ̆ 2 regard the title of militant as a smear, 2 ̆ 2 has few fans among the top leaders of the UAW. But authorization for his local 2 ̆ 7 s strike had been carefully cleared through the union 2 ̆ 7 s regional director, its Chrysler director, and its new president, Owen Bieber, following fifteen fruitless months of local bargaining. As often happens in labor stories, a lot of good questions went unasked in Twinsburg. For example, what was the strike about...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEtosha Pan, {{northern}} Namibia, {{at nearly}} 5, 000 km', {{is one of}} the largest in the world. A major hurdle to understanding the geological history of Etosha Pan has been the lack of dated horizons in the local stratigraphic record. We here report the discovery of fossil plants, invertebrates and vertebrates at several distinct horizons within the pan and its immediate vicinity, which reveal the presence of deposits ranging in age from Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene. Most of the <b>floor</b> of the <b>pan</b> consists of Late Miocene deposits whereas in islands and ridges within the pan and along its margins there occurs a discontinuous deposit of Pliocene, Pleistocene sediments up to 20 metres thick. Finally, there are discontinuous patches of green silts on Pelican Island at an altitude of ca 1093 metres, some 8 - 10 metres above the <b>floor</b> of the <b>pan,</b> which attest to a Late Pleistocene lacustrine episode. Similar aged deposits at the western end of Oshigambo Peninsula has yielded a rich and diverse mammalian fauna containing remains of the aquaphile bovid Tragelaphus spekei (the sitatunga). The discovery of Mio-Pliocene fossils in Elosha is important as it helps to fill whal used to be a large geographic gap in the African palaeonlological map of this epoch. Laie Miocene sites in particular, are poorly represented over much of the continent, being concentrated in the rift valleys of East Africa, the Chad basin, the Maghreb and north African littoral zone. ...|$|R
