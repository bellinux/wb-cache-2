500|$|... "Slim Slow Slider" [...] is {{the only}} song on the album to not have string overdubs and {{according}} to John Payne, Morrison had not played it live before. [...] Like [...] in the song [...] "T.B. Sheets", the singer tells of watching a young girl die, but in [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] the girl seems bent on her own self-destruction: [...] "I know you're dying, baby/I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it too." [...] The song ends abruptly with the words, [...] "Every time I see you, I just don't know what to do." [...] It has been said to be about a junkie but Morrison has only said that it's about someone [...] "who is {{caught up in a}} big city like London or maybe is on dope, I'm not sure." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad that {{features}} elements of pop and soul music. Instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, kick drums, an organ, percussion and a piano. It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe. Hilson phrases: [...] "Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves, cause see, some women just tolerate too damn much. Huh!" ...|$|E

"You don't {{know when}} it's good or bad. <b>You</b> really don't <b>know,</b> because <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> what we're trying to do, you guys don't {{look at the}} films. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> what happened. <b>You</b> really don't <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> think <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> but <b>you</b> don't <b>know.</b> And <b>you</b> never will." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E
2500|$|Iago's plan {{appears to}} succeed when Othello kills Desdemona, who is {{innocent}} of Iago's charges. Soon afterwards, however, Emilia brings Iago's treachery to light, and Iago kills {{her in a}} fit of rage before being arrested. He remains famously reticent when pressed for an explanation of his actions before he is arrested: [...] "Demand me nothing. What you <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> From this time forth I never will speak word." [...] Following Othello's suicide, Cassio, now in charge, condemns Iago to be imprisoned and tortured as punishment for his crimes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first single}} was the ballad [...] "Where Are We Now?", a track which Visconti {{described}} as [...] "the only track {{on the album}} that goes this much inward for him". Visconti suggested that Bowie chose [...] "Where Are We Now?" [...] as the opening single because [...] "people {{had to deal with}} the shock that he was back [...] " [...] and that the introspective nature of the song made it an appropriate choice. Opening lyrics for [...] "Where Are We Now" [...] reflectively recall the name of a train station (plaza) and a street in west Berlin, where Bowie once lived. A video accompanying the single includes props such as a dismantled photo frame lying discarded on the floor in the opening shot, a large ear in the background, and a two-headed soft doll with the torn faces of Bowie and a voiceless counterpart [...] "pasted" [...] onto it in. Lyrics also include the phrase [...] "the moment you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> you know".|$|E
