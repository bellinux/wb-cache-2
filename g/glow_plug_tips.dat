40|$|<b>Glow</b> <b>plugs</b> {{are widely}} used to promote the desired cold start and post-cold start {{combustion}} characteristics of light duty diesel engines. The importance of the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> becomes more apparent when the compression ratio is low. An experimental investigation of combustion initiation and development aided by the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{has been carried out}} on a single cylinder HPCR DI diesel engine with a low compression ratio of 15. 5 : 1. High speed imaging of combustion initiated by the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> in a combustion bomb has been used to add understanding of initiation process. Complementary CFD studies have been carried out using ANSYS Fluent 14. 0 to explore the interactions between the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the spray behavior. Observation of successful combustion initiation show that two conditions must be met, compression heating and heat transfer from the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> must raise temperature of gas nearby to at least 413 ºC and the vapour/air equivalence ratio no lower than 0. 15 - 0. 35. The initiation site was at spray edge close to the <b>glow</b> <b>plug,</b> the flame grew locally before expanding downstream in direction of spray penetration {{after the end of the}} main injection. Experimental studies carried out on the engine indicated that the engine IMEP, heat release and combustion stability were continuously improved by using the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> at ambient temperatures higher than the temperature requiring the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> for initiation of combustion. A rapid development of premixed combustion was achieved associated with improved engine work output, heat release rate and cycle-by-cycle stability. The premixed combustion was enhanced by strengthening spray vaporization through the <b>glow</b> <b>plug.</b> In this study, the combustion behavior was enhanced by the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> up to ambient temperature of 20 ºC. Initiation delay was shortened by a rapid development of combustion aided by the <b>glow</b> <b>plug.</b> An initiation delay model was developed to account for both physical part (transport delay) and chemical part (chemical delay). The transport delay (ms) is equivalent to the time for spray to transport to the vicinity of the <b>glow</b> <b>plug,</b> dictated by parameters including S, distance between the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> and the injector tip (mm) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> used {{in model}} engines are {{significantly}} different from those used in full-size diesel engines. In full-size engines, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is used only for starting. In model engines, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{is an integral part}} of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire. The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is a durable, mostly platinum, helical wire filament recessed into the <b>plug's</b> <b>tip.</b> When an electric current runs through the plug, or when exposed to the heat of the combustion chamber, the filament glows, enabling it to help ignite the special fuel used by these engines. Power can be applied using a special connector attaching to the outside of the engine, and may use a rechargeable battery or DC power source.|$|R

50|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine, or <b>glow</b> engine, {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{internal}} combustion engine typically used in model aircraft, model cars and similar applications. The ignition is accomplished by a combination of heating from compression, heating from a <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the catalytic effect of the platinum within the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> on the methanol within the fuel.|$|R
50|$|The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{controller}} {{is known}} to malfunction on these engines. There are several vehicle applications that use either 4-volt or 7-volt <b>glow</b> <b>plugs.</b> It is at present difficult to ascertain the output voltage of various suppliers' replacement modules. The Dorman 904-310 seems to output 7 volts. There are some year models of Jeep that require a module output for the 4-volt <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> installed on those models. The 2008 Mercedes E320 Bluetec has the NGK CZ 302 <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> (replaced by NGK CZ 303) that require 7 volts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glow</b> <b>plugs</b> have {{a limited}} {{lifetime}} and users are advised to have several replacement plugs on hand. Replacement plugs must be the correct type; plugs for turbo engines are not compatible with plugs for standard engines. The plugs should be tightened a quarter-turn past a snug fit to avoid over-tightening. <b>Glow</b> <b>plugs,</b> like all incandescent objects, are extremely hot, and <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> should never be removed when hot. Likewise, {{care must be taken}} when fueling because a hot <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> can ignite fuel. Overheating of the battery can also be dangerous and only well-made connectors should be used.|$|R

50|$|The is {{engine was}} {{designed}} for 1/2A Texaco RC duration competition. The engine has an additional fin on the larger <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller. i.e. 7 or 8 inches. This engine has a red 8cc fuel tank and a black crankcase. Original 1989 engines did not come out with 5 fin <b>glow</b> <b>plug.</b> The 5 fin <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> came later in the 1992 Catalog.|$|R
40|$|Factors {{determining}} {{the success or}} failure of combustion initiation using a <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> have been investigated through experimental work on a single cylinder, common rail diesel engine with a geometric compression ratio of 15. 5, and a quiescent combustion bomb with optical access. A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> was required to avoid engine misfires when bulk gas temperature at the start of injection was less than 413 C. The distance between the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the spray edge, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature, and the bulk gas temperature were important factors in meeting two requirements for successful ignition: a minimum local temperature of 413 C and a minimum air/fuel vapour equivalence ratio of 0. 15 – 0. 35...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a hotter <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature; in cold weather, hotter plugs are needed. Since <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause rougher idling and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a hotter plug is required.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there is}} a common {{misconception}} that model <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engines are a variation of the hot bulb engine, this is not the case. Model glow engines are catalytic ignition engines. They take advantage of a reaction between platinum in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> coil and methyl alcohol vapour whereby at certain temperatures and pressures platinum will glow in contact with the vapour.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{different}} <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> types: the in-cylinder variety and the in-manifold ("Thermostart") variety. In the case of in-cylinder, there is a plug in every cylinder direct injected (or {{in the case of}} indirect injected, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is in the prechamber providing a hot spot to encourage ignition. In the case of the in-manifold one, there is only one for all the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|When starting, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is {{electrically}} preheated by electric current. The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with a spark plug - there is no spark in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug.</b> Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{oil burners}} use glow bars which operate {{much like the}} <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> of a diesel engine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glow</b> <b>plugs</b> {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} <b>glow</b> <b>plug,</b> the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the <b>plug's</b> filament <b>glowing</b> hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of <b>glow</b> <b>plug,</b> etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuel type}} and the fuel/air mixture {{must also be}} considered. The greater the {{nitromethane}} content in the fuel, the hotter the fuel will burn; high [...] "nitro" [...] fuels require cooler <b>glow</b> <b>plugs.</b> Lean mixtures (low fuel-to-air ratio) burn hotter than rich mixtures (higher fuel-to-air ratio) and operating temperatures can be raised to levels that can prematurely destroy the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> if too lean a mixture is used ("over-leaning").|$|R
5000|$|The Cox [...]049 Engine is a 2-stroke {{internal}} combustion <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine. These engines use a <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{to heat the}} fuel/air within the cylinder to start. Once running it is disconnected and operates {{in the same manner}} as a diesel engine. The self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the air/fuel mix, and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery. Fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system. Fuel/air mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design.|$|R
