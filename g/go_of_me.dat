The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you would be here with me /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{what you}} think," [...] said the doctor. [...] "You'll find {{it will do}} {{you a lot of}} good"; and, making a virtue of a {{somewhat}} imperative necessity, he added: [...] "I'll stay by you. If you'd let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> a minute I'd give you something that would settle you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>of</b> <b>me</b> if you <b>go?</b> What <b>of</b> <b>me</b> {{wedded to}} that monster, to that cruel and inhuman pedant who tortures and insults me {{as you have}} seen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He frowned, {{and swore}} {{he could not}} wed, Seven times he swore it could not be; [...] "Poverty's worse than shame," [...] he said, Till all my hope <b>went</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not {{intended}} as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I have made it, something seems to have <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Send for the {{visitors}} who are there," [...] he said. [...] "They are all to come in. Each {{one of them}} is to take one of my hands in turn--while you remain where you are, holding the other hand. Don't let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> even for a moment. My mother will ring." ...|$|E
6000|$|I couldn't get {{the dear}} child {{to lie down}} or leave <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and indeed I hadn't the heart to try, so I stepped out on the {{footboard}} with her holding round my neck. They all set up a laugh when they see us, and one chuckle-headed Joskin (that I hated for it) made the bidding, [...] "Tuppence for her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Shaking CHRIS off--furiously] Lave <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> ye old ape! Marry her, is it? I'd see her {{roasting}} in hell first! I'm shipping away out of this, I'm telling you! [Pointing to Anna--passionately] And my {{curse on}} you and the curse of Almighty God and all the Saints! You've destroyed me this day and may you lie awake in the long nights, tormented with thoughts of Mat Burke and the great wrong you've done him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, and to-night you'll finish it!" [...] Vont cried, with uplifted head. [...] "After to-night you'll be quit of your oath, {{and you can}} <b>go</b> free <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I've made it all {{easy for}} you. It's all planned out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{light has}} <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and I am a {{sick and tired}} woman. But I'm talking wisdom--bitter wisdom. I couldn't be any sort of helper to you, any sort of wife, any sort of mother. I'm spoilt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} rest. All the bounce has <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> Mate," [...] {{he said with}} sad lines in his face. [...] "Any extra work here {{is out of the}} question. I can only shamble around-an excuse for a man." ...|$|R
60|$|Then she let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> She {{had given}} up. I {{thought she was}} going to drop, and drew her toward the stone. I cursed the day I ever saw Neal and the service. Where, now, was the arch prettiness, the gay, sweet charm of Sally Langdon? She looked as if she were {{suffering}} from a desperate physical injury. And her final breakdown showed how, one way or another, I was lost to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jump up, young un," [...] Bill said; [...] "and you, Jack, get {{off your}} sea-boots. You stand just behind me and hold on, I feel much steadier now that I have got Joe on my shoulders. If {{you feel that you}} are going, leave <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> you will only pull me {{backward}} holding on; and as you can swim you are all right. You have only got to keep yourself afloat, the tide will drift you up to the island in no time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have trusted you too long, Effie," [...] he cried, sternly. [...] "Leave <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me!</b> I {{must pass}} you. My friends and I {{are going to}} settle this matter once and forever!" [...] He pushed her to one side, and we {{followed}} closely after him. As he threw the door open an old woman ran {{out in front of}} him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered at his heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell her {{she need}} not <b>go</b> because <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I shall not return. I shall not annoy her here. It {{would have been}} much better that a woman in such a plight should not have come to such an assembly." ...|$|R
60|$|Without letting <b>go</b> {{his hold}} <b>of</b> <b>me</b> he turned about, his {{face lit up}} bright as day by the full moon.|$|R
60|$|They {{dragged me}} up the beach, and then they let <b>go</b> their hold <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and stood round in a circle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Mr. Marvelling; I {{want you}} to let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and be reasonable," [...] {{returned}} Matt, as calmly as he could. [...] "I am not a thief. If I was, would I tell the story I did, or send down your companion to find those things? My story about that object under the bridge is true, and, to my way of thinking, it was the thief you saw jump the fence and run in this direction. When I sprang down to bathe my face and hands he got scared and ran out {{on the other side}} of the bridge, and in his hurry he must have dropped the things which have been found." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{looked about}} me, and, {{although}} the dawn was only just breaking, began to recognise my surroundings. Surely {{this was the}} Prinsloos' house to my right, and that, faintly seen through the mist about a hundred paces away, was Marie's and my own. There seemed to be something going on yonder which excited my awakening curiosity. I could see figures moving in an unusual manner, and desired {{to know what they}} were doing. I began to walk towards them, and Hans, for his part, began to try to drag me in an opposite direction, uttering all sorts of gibberish as to the necessity of my running away. But I would not be dragged; indeed, I struck at him, until at last, with an exclamation of despair, he let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and vanished.|$|E
60|$|I am not {{a nervous}} man in a general way, and very little troubled with superstitions, of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to own that this sight quite upset me, and {{had it not been}} that Sir Henry caught me by the collar and held me, I do {{honestly}} believe that in another five minutes I should have been outside the stalactite cave, and that a promise of all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again. But he held me tight, so I stopped because I could not help myself. Next second, however, his eyes became accustomed to the light, and he let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he swore feebly, while Foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.|$|E
6000|$|The stake! The {{strength}} <b>went</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{almost fell}} down. It {{is hard to}} get one's breath at such a time, such lumps come into one's throat, and such gaspings; {{but as soon as}} I could speak, I said: ...|$|R
60|$|And it wasn't {{only the}} earthlier {{aspects of the}} life about <b>me</b> but also <b>of</b> the life within me that I had been discovering. The first wonder and innocence, the worshipping, dawn-clear passion <b>of</b> youth, had <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me</b> for ever....|$|R
6000|$|... "Jee-rusalem!" [...] he said, [...] "that {{was a close}} call. I don't {{know how}} you felt, boys, but {{it seemed as if}} all the sand had <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{weakened}} so that my knees have not done shaking yet." ...|$|R
60|$|But I did not heed their impudence, and {{was walking}} {{straight}} toward the cabin-door on the quarter-deck, when the chief mate met me. I touched my hat, and was passing him, when, after {{staring at me}} till I thought his eyes would burst out, he all at once caught me by the collar, and with a voice of thunder, {{wanted to know what}} I meant by playing such tricks aboard a ship that he was mate of? I told him to let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> or I would complain to my friend the captain, whom I intended to visit that evening. Upon this he gave me such a whirl round, that I thought the Gulf Stream was in my head; and then shoved me forward, roaring out I know not what. Meanwhile the sailors were all standing round the windlass looking aft, mightily tickled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honest, I'll {{tell you}} {{everything}} just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. It didn't seem no good for ME to stay--I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Still another figure arises {{out of the}} old life--Jackson's lawyer. Least of {{all would}} I have {{expected}} again to meet this man, Joseph Hurd. It was a strange meeting. Late at night, two years after the Chicago Commune, Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge. This was in Michigan, across the lake from Chicago. We arrived just {{at the conclusion of the}} trial of a spy. Sentence of death had been passed, and he was being led away. Such was the scene as we came upon it. The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung himself at my feet, his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy. As he turned his agonized face up to me, I recognized him as Joseph Hurd. Of all the terrible things I have witnessed, never have I been so unnerved as by this frantic creature's pleading for life. He was mad for life. It was pitiable. He refused to let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> despite the hands of a dozen comrades. And when at last he was dragged shrieking away, I sank down fainting upon the floor. It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg for life.* ...|$|E
60|$|ADAM. Fear {{will drive}} me to anything. The serpent gave me fear. Let it now give me {{certainty}} or <b>go</b> in fear <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall {{come into}} the village every day, Abner, an' you won't bother us at all, for you shall <b>go</b> 'long <b>of</b> <b>me</b> {{everywhere}} I do, an' I won't never walk any faster'n you can;" [...] and Toby moved his seat nearer Abner, {{to show that he}} took him under his especial care.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>go</b> {{on account}} <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> Laban," [...] {{she said with}} the same fierce courage she had shown in driving him from her before. [...] "If it's for me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Their early {{conversations were}} about Susan Burnet's {{business}} and the general condition of things in that world of upholsterers' young women in which Susan had lived until she perceived the possibilities of a [...] "connexion," [...] and set up for herself. And the condition of things in that world, as Susan described it, brought home to Lady Harman just how sheltered and limited her own upbringing had been. [...] "It isn't right," [...] said Susan, [...] "the way they send girls out with fellers into empty houses. Naturally the men get persecuting them. They don't seem hardly able to help it, some of them, and I will say this for them, {{that a lot of}} the girls go more than half way with them, leading them on. Still there's a sort of man won't leave you alone. One I used to be sent out with and a married man too he was, Oh!--he used to give me a time. Why I've bit his hands before now, bit hard, before he'd leave <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> It's my opinion the married men are worse than the single. Bolder they are. I pushed him over a scuttle once and he hit his head against a bookcase. I was fair frightened of him. 'You little devil,' he says; 'I'll be even with you yet....' Oh! I've been called worse things than that.... Of course a respectable girl gets through with it, but it's trying and to some it's a sort of temptation...." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is based}} on two lovers in a long {{distance}} relationship, where McCoy says they're on the same sphere despite 3 months apart, while Mraz sings the lines 'Never let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> Hold tight, It's gonna get hard to breathe" [...] in an emotional hook. The song also features many references to the 1998 film Titanic, ie. [...] "loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me, but this boat can stay afloat {{as long as you}} hold me".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Kumuhana. [...] "But it is many a {{year now}} since the last of such heat has <b>gone</b> out <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I {{remember}} it as one remembers an old sunrise--a thing that was. And so one grows old, and cold, and drinks gin, not for madness, but for warmth. And the milk is very nourishing.|$|R
60|$|My {{duties as}} head of the Cliff Dwellers and as Secretary of The Theater Society tended to keep me in Chicago. My lecture engagements became fewer and I dropped out or Eastern Club life, {{retaining}} only long distance connection with the world of Arts and Letters.
