40|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the natural}} history of Crohn’s disease (CD) before diagnosis. By the time the patient is diagnosed, the disease has often {{produced}} considerable damage to the intestinal mucosa and sometimes other organs. Such period before diagnosis might involve both a silent and a symptomatic phase. The silent phase, or preclinical CD, might last several years after the biological disease onset. Evidence is accumulating that the symptomatic phase might also go undiagnosed for months or years. In fact, for each established case of CD, there are probably several undiagnosed cases, a classic <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of disease. Such status quo—lagging behind diagnostic standards for many other diseases—effectively hampers efforts to block disease evolution and the development of complications. This is no longer tenable because CD is a debilitating, severe, and costly affection, whose incidence is rapidly rising worldwide. Here, we will review what is currently known on preclinical and undiagnosed CD and what could be done to improve accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although the dengue <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is well known, {{there is}} a paucity of data on {{inapparent}} dengue. Results from a seroepidemiological study conducted during a dengue epidemic in 2007 in Singapore showed a seroprev-alence of 65. 9 % and an inapparent dengue rate of 78 %. Older adults (> 45 years old) had significantly higher rates of inapparent dengue infections (P < 0. 05). Since the first report of a dengue epidemic in 1901, Singapore has had outbreaks of dengue fever (DF). Unlikemany countries in the region, dengue cases in Singapore are largely reported among the adult population, 1, 2 and dengue mortality is mainly observed in adults. 3 Dengue infection is often epitomized by the iceberg effect, in which most cases are clinically inapparent. 4 Although inapparent dengue {{has been reported in}} many coun-tries, 5 – 7 there is little data on its epidemiology or the extent of its severity. During the dengue epidemic in Singapore in 2007, we conducted cross-sectional seroepidemiologic surveys in seven outbreak areas (Figure 1) to estimate the dengue attac...|$|E
40|$|Carriage of animal-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex 398 (CC 398) {{is common}} among pig farmers. This study was {{conducted}} (i) to investigate whether pig farmers are colonized with pig-specific S. aureus genotypes other than CC 398 and (ii) to survey antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus isolates from pigs and pig farmers. Forty-eight S. aureus isolates from pig farmers and veterinarians and 130 isolates from pigs collected in Western Switzerland were genotyped by spa typing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined for representative sample of the isolates. The data obtained earlier on healthy S. aureus carriers without exposure to agriculture were used for comparison. The genotype composition of S. aureus isolates from pig farmers and veterinarians was similar to isolates from pigs with predominant AFLP clusters CC 398, CC 9, and CC 49. The resistance to tetracycline and macrolides (clarithromycin) was common among the isolates from farmers and veterinarians (52 and 21 %, respectively) and similar to resistance levels in isolates from pigs (39 and 23 %, respectively). This was in contrast to isolates from persons without contact with agriculture, where no (0 / 128) isolates were resistant to tetracycline and 3 % of the isolates were resistant to clarithromycin. MRSA CC 398 was isolated from pigs (n = 11) and pig farmers (n = 5). These data imply that zoonotic transmission of multidrug-resistant S. aureus from pigs to farmers is frequent, and well-known MRSA transmission merely represents {{the tip of the}} <b>iceberg</b> for this <b>phenomenon.</b> We speculate that the relatively low frequency of MRSA isolation is related to lower antimicrobial use in Switzerland compared to, for example, the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Between 1841 and 1853, 248 {{women were}} transported from Ireland to Van Diemen's Land for arson. Of this number, there is {{evidence}} that at least seventynine women in the Famine and post-Famine period committed arson in order to be transported. This group of deliberate offenders challenges traditional notions of convict historiography and raises questions about the fundamental nature of criminality and transportation. This thesis argues that the women, as active agents, were using transportation as a form of emigration. For many poor women in Famine and post-Famine Ireland, emigration was not an option because they did not meet selection criteria for assisted emigration schemes, or could not afford the costs associated with emigration. Arson was a perfect crime for those who wished to be caught. It was visible, immediate, and effective. It was serious enough to warrant transportation. By the early 1850 s, it was entrenched as a means of engineering transportation among women, a fact recognised by the Irish courts and frequently commented upon in Irish newspapers. There {{is no evidence that the}} deliberate arsonists were social or political protesters. For them, arson was a means to an end, not a political statement. More than passive economic victims, the deliberate arsonists were marginalised women actively seeking to change their circumstances. Initially, this was from the dislocation and chaos of Famine and post-Famine Ireland but the process continued in Van Diemen's Land. A major focus of this thesis is the colonial experience of the deliberate arsonists, tracing what happened to them and examining whether there was evidence that they tried to improve their position in the colony, especially when they were free. This thesis argues that, by using a number of survival strategies, the women's attempts to seek control over their lives continued. This thesis is presented in two parts. The first contains an historiographical survey, an explanation of the methodology, the Irish background to the phenomenon as well as a profile of the deliberate arsonists. The second part analyses social and economic outcomes for the women in Van Diemen's Land: marriage, economic survival, and death. Research has been primarily based on convict records, newspaper reports of trials, civil registration records, colonial newspapers, colonial court records, and family papers. Detailed biographies of the seventy-nine deliberate arsonists have been compiled as Volume Two of the thesis. This thesis adds to the body of knowledge about the female convict experience, generally, and the deliberate arsonists, specifically. As far as I am aware, this is the first time that a comprehensive study of a group of convict women, grouped by crime, has been carried out. It is also the first time that a study has looked specifically and extensively at 'courting transportation', at transportation as emigration, and, in this respect, it has only touched the tip of an <b>iceberg.</b> The <b>phenomenon</b> of deliberately courting transportation was not limited to the female arsonists or post-Famine Ireland, although it was a period when it was undeniably most effectively and publicly used. Transportation was not regarded as punishment by impoverished, marginalised women in Famine and post-Famine Ireland but a way of improving their situation. This thesis is also the first time that the female post-sentence convict experience has been looked at in detail in a Tasmanian context, with a focus on individuals, and using family history techniques. It concludes that, despite economic, political and social constraints imposed on them, in Ireland and Van Diemen's Land, the deliberate arsonists exercised agency over their lives by using a number of survival strategies...|$|R
40|$|Johne’s disease (JD) is a chronic, enteric {{disease in}} {{ruminants}} caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Disease progression follows four distinct stages: silent, subclinical, clinical and advanced. Available diagnostic tests have poor sensitivity and cannot detect {{early stages of}} the infection; as a result, only animals in the clinical and advanced stages, which represent the tip of the ‘iceberg’, are identified through testing. The <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Phenomenon</b> is then applied to provide estimates for JD prevalence. For one animal in the advanced stage, it is assumed that there are one to two in the clinical stage, four to eight in the subclinical stage, and ten to fourteen in the silent stage. These ratios, however, are based on little evidence. To evaluate the ratios, we developed a deterministic ordinary differential equation model of JD transmission and disease progression dynamics. When duration periods associated with the natural course of the disease progression are used, the above ratios do not hold. The ratios used to estimate JD prevalence need to be further investigated...|$|E

40|$|Domestic Violence, {{particularly}} {{against women}} {{is a social}} phenomenon which tends to increase {{from year to year}} and even from day to day. Many countries enacted special legislation to protect women from domestic violence based on the United Nation Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (CEDAW). Indonesia adopted the conventions based on the Indonesian Act No. 7 of 1984 on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and issued Presidential Decree No. 9 of 1998 concerning the Commission on Violence against Women. Indonesia then enacted special legislation on domestic violence in 2004, namely Domestic Violence Act 23, 2004. This paper aims to understand how the Domestic Violence Act 23, 2004 protects women victims of domestic violence. The sources of law study are the basic rules and regulations, International conventions which have binding force legally. This is a library research using normative judicial approach, and the analysis is descriptive qualitative. The legal protection of women victims of domestic violence is an obligation, especially for countries that uphold human rights, because of the domestic violence constitutes crimes against humanity that are outstanding. This crime happens at any time either known or not, so it is described as an <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> In addition, because this matter is private, many people do not want to intervene the matter.

40|$|Introduction: WHO {{states that}} the {{proportion}} of deaths and casualty registrations of RTA cases represents only the tip of the iceberg. A similar tip of the <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon</b> exists between the visible expenses incurred due to the accidents and the much larger invisible losses are there that imperceptibly disable the family budget. Objective: (1) To estimate the total expenditure on treatment of RTA cases  and its proportion to their monthly family income on treatment. (2) To estimate the loss of wages of  RTA cases and project the other losses. (3) To enquire reimbursement of losses of RTA cases. Materials and methods : A hospital based cross sectional study, conducted at ED and Hospital of S. N. Medical College, Agra. Data were collected by using semi structured questionnaire from RTA cases or their attendants. Results: Out of 425 admitted RTA cases, 318 (74. 8 %) had spent Rs > 5, 000 on the treatment and 304 (71. 5 %) had lost their wages Rs > 1, 000.   73. 2 % had incurred hospital expenses from 1 to 10 times or even more of their monthly family income. About 1 / 4 th cases recovered completely and 64. 01 % recovered with temporary physical deficit. 3. 5 % had health insurance. 75. 8 % cases had remained hospitalized for more than 1 week or up to a month duration and a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 83) was found between the length of stay in the hospital and the amount spent on the treatment.

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{is often described}} as an <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon</b> which can be interpreted as a conflict that occurred in the domestic sphere that can be handled well to completion is a conflict that appears on the surface. Generally, domestic {{violence is}} often done for people who are physically weak, for example, women, even children can also happen to other people living in the house but a sick family household relationship instance. If you listen closely it will be found a lot of the crime of domestic violence is still not revealed and has not got a way out in accordance with applicable law. It is certainly based on many factors such as the idea that domestic violence is a family disgrace unfit to be known by the surrounding environment. This sort of thing impede law enforcement officials acted quickly to handle the conflict not to harm the victim. but it is not rare to find a situation where victims of crimes of domestic violence there who dared to denounce the case to the police in the hope that reason follow varies for example because they are not resistant to the conditions continue to be tortured. In cases where the police have received reports and complaints from victims and police to the public must keep records of the witnesses, victims and other details.

40|$|A high {{frequency}} of sexual violence against children occured in Indonesia undeniably requires {{government to take}} any nesessary and serious steps to handle it. Day to day, the cases of sexual violence against children are just like an <b>iceberg</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The appearance on the surface is so little, but so many cases on the ground actually are still covered. Even, severe punishment imposed to offenders does not make them stopped reoffending it. In response of sexual violence against children, the government of Indonesia eventually issued the Government Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 01 Year 2016 about the second amendment of the Child Protection Law No. 23 Year 2002. Actratively, amongst the provisions regulated, the debatable provision of the Government Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 01 Year 2016 is about the application of chemical castration toward the offender as one of additional punishment. Most {{people as well as}} government agree on the effectiveness of chemical castration in reducing the incidences of sexual violence against children. At glance, this punishment as if provides the best protection for children from either occuring or reoccuring the incidences of sexual violence. However, if we further analyse the nature as well as the impact of chemical castration, this punishment does not protect the interest of children as victims. Concerning the balancing principle, the application of chemical castration does not accomodate the balancing idea of law. It is only oriented to offender without taking into account the interest of victims, considering o child who is victimized to sexual violence tends to suffer psychologial problem such as rape trauma syndrom in her entire life, and he/she may potentially become offender in the future. In this matter, there is no attention or specific treatment such as administering compesation provided for victims as mandated by Declaration of Basic Principle of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. In term of deterrence effect, chemical castration only contains temporary deterrence, and less futuristic­ orientation. We may say that this punishment is sustainable and expensive punishment. The offender must routinely be injected and the effect of chemical castration may endure only in more and less three months. Taking into account the serious impact of sexual violence to the development of children, the legal issues we present in this article is whether the chemical castration sanctions implementation has reflected the victim protection? This research is a legal research with normative as well as conceptual approach. It aims at measuring to what extent the application of chemical castration in protecting children, either as victims or victims-to be...|$|E
