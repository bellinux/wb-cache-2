5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} road haulage had drawn away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track <b>itself</b> <b>was</b> poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.|$|E
5|$|During May 1926, the {{approach}} road between Wentworth and {{the bridge was}} being progressively metalled, but could not be completed in its entirety until construction of the bridge <b>itself</b> <b>was</b> complete.

5|$|In April 2013, {{the horror}} comedy Scary Movie 5 was released, where Lohan appears as herself {{alongside}} Charlie Sheen {{in the opening}} sketch. While the movie <b>itself</b> <b>was</b> panned by critics, a few reviewers found Lohan's and Sheen's {{to be one of}} the better scenes.

5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and that the story <b>itself</b> <b>was</b> very effective.

5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation.

5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville <b>itself</b> <b>was</b> fresh enough to support populations of fish.
