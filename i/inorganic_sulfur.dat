The N-terminal domain coordinates the two [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters in a fold that is almost identical {{to that of other}} known ferredoxins. However, the structure has two unique features.

Our studies reveal a distinct enhancement of GSNO decomposition by compounds such as diallyltrisulfane, which is most pronounced in the presence of cysteine and glutathione and presumably proceeds via the initial release of an inorganic mono- or polysulfides, i. e., hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) or HSx−, from the organic polysulfane. Albeit being of a preliminary nature, our spectrophotometric data also reveals a complicated underlying mechanism which appears to involve transient species such as SSNO−.

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} use <b>inorganic</b> {{nitrogen and}} <b>sulfur</b> compounds for energy metabolism. These compounds are often toxic and so bacteria must adapt to survive their deleterious effects. Bacteria use specific proteins {{in order to}} metabolise, sense and detoxify these compounds. In this thesis protein interactions with <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen and <b>sulfur</b> compounds are examined at the mechanistic level. Intermediates in the Sox sulfur oxidation pathway are covalently attached to a cysteine on the swinging arm of the substrate carrier protein SoxYZ. An interaction between the Sox pathway enzyme SoxB and the carrier protein SoxYZ is demonstrated. A crystal structure of a trapped SoxB-SoxYZ complex at 3. 3 Å resolution identifies two sites of interaction, one between the SoxYZ carrier arm and the SoxB active site channel and the other at a patch distal to the active site. The presence of a distal interaction site suggests a mechanism for promiscuous specificity in the protein-protein interactions of the Sox pathway. Using biophysical methods it is shown that SoxB distinguishes between the substrate and product forms of the carrier protein through differences in interaction kinetics and that the carrier arm-bound substrate group is able to out-compete the adjacent C-terminal carboxylate for binding to the SoxB active site. The thiosulfate dehydrogenase TsdA has an unusual His/Cys coordinated heme. TsdA catalyses oxidative conjugation of two thiosulfate molecules to form tetrathionate. Mass spectrometry and UV/visible spectroscopy are used to identify an S-thiosulfonate reaction intermediate which is covalently attached to the cysteine heme ligand. A catalytic mechanism for TsdA is proposed using a crystal structure of TsdA at 1. 3 Å resolution alongside site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues. Nitric oxide is produced by the mammalian immune response to kill bacterial pathogens. Part of the killing mechanism occurs through the reaction of nitric oxide with protein-bound iron-sulfur clusters. However, {{the same type of}} reaction is also exploited by nitric oxide-sensing bacterial proteins. An infrared spectroscopy approach is developed to detect the products of iron-sulfur protein nitrosylation.

These observations are of physiological relevance because bacteria are often exposed to NO under aerobic conditions during an immune response. This file is not currently available in OR...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to {{gain an understanding of}} the corrosion chemistry and materials behavior in high temperature environments. Of particular interest are the mechanisms of attack in environments containing more than one reactive species, for example sulfur and oxygen. Sulfur is a critical impurity in almost all energy sources and leads to accelerated, and often unacceptable rates of metal degradation. In addition, the competitive formation of potentially more than one phase as a reaction product is an important fundamental problem, and can only be truly understood if the underlying thermodynamic and transport properties of the systems, and their interrelation, are identified. Sulfur can appear in a number of forms. In entirely gaseous environments it can appear as H{sub Z}S when the oxidizing potential of the atmosphere is low, such as might exist in energy conversion systems, or as SO{sub 2 }/SO{sub 3 } at higher oxygen potentials, such as those produced by fuel combustion.
