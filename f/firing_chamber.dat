25|$|A {{revolver}} {{works by}} having several firing chambers {{arranged in a}} circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time. In contrast, other repeating firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, pump-action, and semi-automatic, have a single <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> and a mechanism to load and extract cartridges into it.|$|E
25|$|Semi-automatic {{refers to}} a firearm which uses the force of recoil or gas to eject the empty case and load a fresh {{cartridge}} into the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> for the next shot and which allows repeat shots solely through the action of pulling the trigger. A double-action revolver also requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired but is not considered semi-automatic since the manual action of pulling the trigger is what advances the cylinder, not {{the energy of the}} preceding shot.|$|E
25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|E

5000|$|The epiphany marker {{represents}} an upgraded {{version of the}} Ion.The Epiphany is a more stylized, upgraded Ion which comes with several factory enhancements out of the box, saving the user from buying the more inexpensive Ion and having to buy separate upgraded components for it over time. Besides for the obvious cosmetic difference, Epiphanies feature a metal exoskeleton and frame (with plating, to avoid threading problems), upgraded Firebolt, Freak barrel starter, integrated ASA dovetail, Q-Lock Feed Neck (Eos only), and Smartvalve ASA among other things. Internally the Epiphany also gives the user the ability to alter the marker's internal firing air volume. This is carried out by select from three different internal air volume [...] "inserts" [...] which are used to take up slack space in the marker's <b>fire</b> <b>chamber.</b> The smaller air space in the <b>fire</b> <b>chamber</b> can refill faster, which allows the Epiphany to fire faster without velocity drop-off {{when compared to the}} Ion and SP-8. The <b>fire</b> <b>chamber</b> inserts allow fine-tuning and adjustment that wouldn't be previously available without developing a homemade modification. The Epiphany <b>fire</b> <b>chamber,</b> inserts and valve spring are available as performance upgrades for the Ion and SP-8. Epiphanies are available in multiple colors and cost around $300.|$|R
50|$|TKB-011 (ТКБ-011), TKB-011M (ТКБ-011М) and TKB-011 2M (ТКБ-011 2М) were Soviet bullpup assault rifles, {{capable of}} fully {{automatic}} <b>fire,</b> <b>chambered</b> for the 7.62×39mm round, {{developed by the}} small arms designer Nikolai M. Afanasyev from 1963 to 1965.|$|R
500|$|The {{main battery}} of the Danton-class ships {{consisted}} of four 305mm Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each turret could elevate up to +12° that gave the guns a maximum range of [...] The guns fired [...] armour-piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of [...] {{at a rate of}} 1.5 rounds per minute. Each turret stored eight rounds along the rear wall and their propellant was kept between the floor of the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> and the bottom of the turret. The ships normally stowed 75 rounds per gun, but space was available for an additional 10 rounds. Their secondary armament consisted of twelve 240mm/50 Modèle 1902 guns in six twin-gun turrets, three {{on each side of the}} ship. Maximum elevation of the turrets was +13° and the [...] shell could be fired to a range of [...] The guns could fire at a rate of two rounds per minute. Each turret had space for 12 shells and the necessary 36 propellant charges; 80 rounds per gun was normally carried, but maximum capacity was 100 rounds per gun.|$|E
2500|$|A {{semi-automatic}} firearm, or self-loading firearm, is {{one that}} not only fires a bullet each time the trigger is pulled, but also performs all steps necessary to prepare it to discharge again—assuming cartridges remain in the firearm's feed device. Typically, this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber,</b> re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber.</b> To fire again, the trigger is released and re-pressed.|$|E
2500|$|The single {{two-level}} combat block comprises two firing {{chambers and}} one machine gun turret. [...] The west <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> was {{armed with a}} machine gun embrasure and a machine gun/47mm anti-tank gun embrasure (JM/AC47). [...] The east <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> was equipped with two JM/AC47 embrasures and a JM embrasure. [...] Three automatic rifle cloches (GFM) on the surface provided spotting for ouvrage Métrich, along with a machine gun turret. [...] The integral usine was equipped with two [...] Renault engines.|$|E
50|$|An ancient Byzantine-era bathhouse was {{recently}} discovered in central Ozurgeti and the ruins are under excavation. It is a two storey-structure. The lower, subterranean floor was the <b>fire</b> <b>chamber</b> which heated an upper floor that containing public baths.|$|R
50|$|About 60 {{climbing}} kilns formerly {{operated in}} Tokoname. The Toei kiln operated from around 1887 to 1974, {{and is the}} biggest climbing kiln in Japan. It has eight <b>firing</b> <b>chambers</b> running a 17° incline and ten chimneys of varying height.|$|R
50|$|High heating {{efficiencies}} on closed appliances {{can only}} be attained by controlling the supply of air to the <b>fire</b> <b>chamber</b> (operating the air control correctly). It is not recommended to leave the air control fully open, except when helping the chimney/flue heat up initially. A fully open air control {{will lead to more}} heat being sent straight up the chimney rather than into the room (which reduces efficiency). The biggest problem with leaving the air control fully open is “overfiring”. Overfiring is caused when too much heat is generated within the <b>fire</b> <b>chamber,</b> which will lead to warping, buckling and general damage to the stove and its internal components. Individual stoves will have their own quirks, so it is necessary to learn each new stove's settings.|$|R
2500|$|At this point, a link pivots {{the rear}} of the barrel down, out of locking {{recesses}} in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame's vertical impact surface. [...] As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> and an ejector strikes {{the rear of}} the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber.</b> At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again.|$|E
2500|$|The single {{infantry}} block possessed two firing {{chambers and}} one machine gun turret. The north chamber was equipped for a machine gun/37mm anti-tank gun combination (JM/AC37), and was surmounted by an automatic rifle cloche (GFM). [...] The south <b>firing</b> <b>chamber</b> was equipped similarly. [...] The usine {{was equipped with}} two Baudouin motors, of [...] each.|$|E

50|$|Kelly Kettle, Storm Kettle, Ghillie Kettle, Thermette and Volcano Kettle are {{trade names}} for {{efficient}} portable devices for boiling water outdoors using twigs {{and other small}} combustible materials; these devices consist of a water jacket surrounding a <b>fire</b> <b>chamber</b> which creates an upward chimney draft ensuring efficient and rapid boiling even in windy or wet weather.|$|R
50|$|Wood-fired ovens are {{distinct}} from wood-fired stoves {{that have a}} hot cooking surface for pots and pans, like on a gas or electric stove. A wood stove may also have an oven separate from the <b>fire</b> <b>chamber.</b> Regardless of material they all have an oven chamber consisting of a floor (or hearth), a dome and an entry (oven opening).|$|R
2500|$|The Armstrong breech loaders used a {{vertical}} sliding block, called a vent-piece, {{which had a}} conical copper-ringed plug on its front surface which sealed the <b>firing</b> <b>chamber,</b> to close the breech. To hold both block and plug tightly in place the guns used a hollow breech screw (hence the name [...] "screw breech") behind the block, which the gunner rotated to tighten and seal the breech before firing.|$|E
2500|$|The single combat block has two firing {{chambers}} and a central barracks surmounted by {{a machine gun}} turret.
