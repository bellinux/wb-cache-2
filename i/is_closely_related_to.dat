5|$|Daspletosaurus <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{the much}} larger and more recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} of mitochondrial small-subunit rDNA sequences suggests that B.nobilissimus, which {{belongs in the}} hymenochaetoid clade, <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the genera Oxyporus and Schizopora.

50|$|Bromsgroveia <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Ctenosauriscus, and {{together}} with a few other genera they make up Ctenosauriscidae.

5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{with the}} spinner shark (C. brevipinna), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the graceful shark, the blacktip shark, and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E
5|$|Boletus aereus, {{the dark}} cep or bronze bolete, {{is a highly}} prized and much sought-after edible {{mushroom}} in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is widely consumed in Spain (Basque Country and Navarre), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the Mediterranean. Described as a new species in 1789 by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard, it <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> several other European boletes, including B.reticulatus, B.pinophilus, and the popular B.edulis. Some populations in North Africa have been classified as a separate species, B.mamorensis, although they are phylogenetically very close.|$|E

5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic {{language}} that was first spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.|$|E
5|$|Hope <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification {{of one of}} the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, {{can be interpreted as}} parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses.

5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum, {{commonly}} known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball, is a type of puffball mushroom in the genus Lycoperdon. The saprobic species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in deciduous woods, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, Lycoperdon americanum, but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors. Molecular analysis indicates that L.echinatum <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the puffball genus Handkea.|$|E
5|$|Prestoea is a genus of pinnate-leaved palms {{found in}} Central and South America and the Caribbean. It <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the genus Euterpe.

Four other species, P. decurrens, P. ensiformis, P. longipetiolata and P. pubens are found along the Caribbean coast of Central America.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, a foil for Prospero, <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses.

Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E
