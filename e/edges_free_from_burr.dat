40|$|International audienceThe {{fragmentation}} of a laminar undulating liquid sheet flowing in quiescent air is investigated. Combining various observations and measurements we propose a sequential atomization scenario describing the overall sheet–drop transition in this configuration. The undulation {{results from a}} controlled primary Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. As the liquid travels through the undulating pattern, it experiences transient accelerations perpendicular to the sheet. These accelerations trigger a secondary instability responsible for the amplification of spanwise thickness modulations of the sheet. This mechanism, called the ‘wavy corridor', {{is responsible for the}} sheet <b>free</b> <b>edge</b> indentations <b>from</b> which liquid ligaments emerge and break, forming drops.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{buckling}} behaviour of rectangular Mindlin plates having two parallel edges simply supported, one <b>edge</b> <b>free</b> {{and the remaining}} <b>edge</b> <b>free,</b> simply supported or clamped. The proper boundary conditions at <b>free</b> <b>edges</b> subjected to in-plane loads have been examined. The buckling analysis is performed by applying the concept of state space to the Levy-type solution method to obtain the closed-form critical loads from the governing differential equations. The results, where possible, are compared with existing solutions to verify {{the validity of the}} solution method. The differences between buckling factors obtained with the appropriate and inappropriate <b>free</b> <b>edge</b> conditions are reported.

40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} in materials and structures {{can be studied}} on different length scales. On a structural level, failure can be observed as the propagation of a single crack. However, when zooming into the apparent crack tip, it is revealed that the actual failure process is set by the nucleation and growth of multiple micro-cracks that together form the dominant crack. In crystalline materials, the nucleation of cracks {{can be traced back}} to even smaller levels of observation. The collective glide of dislocations in the atomistic structure of these materials appears to be the driving mechanism for the nucleation of micro-cracks near <b>free</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>From</b> a mathematical point of view the creation and propagation of cracks and the glide of dislocations can be considered as evolving discontinuities in the material. This thesis focuses on the numerical representation of these discontinuities on different length scales, varying from the simulation of delamination growth in fibre-metal laminates to a model that incorporates slip due to the motion of discrete dislocations.

At low temperatures the dimensionless inverse step edge stiffness reduces to the universal value View the MathML source. However, with increasing temperature the dimensionless inverse step edge stiffness increases. Incorporation of an attractive next-nearest neighbour interaction leads to a suppression of the dimensionless inverse step edge stiffness. For a non-zero next-nearest neighbour interaction the dimensionless inverse step edge stiffness even vanishes at zero temperature...|$|R
