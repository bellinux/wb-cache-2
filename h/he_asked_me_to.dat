25|$|Lynn Townsend was at {{odds with}} the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do {{something}} to please them. So in 1965 <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come to his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E
25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{was rather}} taken aback {{when the doctor}} entered the Anfield boot room", Wark said. [...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
2500|$|I {{moved up}} in the world of wingmen by flying Col. Francis Gabreski's wing on a mission. I was {{absolutely}} thrilled to fly on this legend's wing...He was a tiger and went on to become an ace again. When asked who I looked up to the most as a pilot and a gentleman in all my flying, I still have to say it was [...] "Gabby" [...] Gabreski. When he took over the 51st Wing, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move over as a flight leader in his outfit.|$|E

2500|$|John Masters {{noted in}} one of his autobiographies (The Road Past Mandalay) that Pete Rees was an abstinent (he [...] "spoke softly, never swore, never drank, did not smoke." [...] but also, [...] "always wore a small kind smile"). According to Masters, Rees was a {{polyglot}} and spoke English, Welsh, [...] "Urdu, Marathi, Pushtu, Burmese, and Tamil. Now <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> teach him Gurkhali, and soon he knew enough to cause a look of startled pleasure to cross many a stolid Gurung face." [...] Masters also said of Rees that he had a [...] "rare, personal gentleness and unfailing good manners".|$|E
2500|$|Whaley met Tarantino {{while he}} was filming Reservoir Dogs at a lab in Sundance Institute. As he recalled, [...] "we ended up meeting and {{spending}} time together, and I liked him, so I was really happy when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be in this movie." [...] Regarding the reputation of his character, he said: [...] "When I came home, I was walking {{on the streets of}} Manhattan, and people were just screaming, [...] "Check out the big brain on Brett!" [...] And I was, like, [...] "What the fuck are you talking about?" [...] But to this day, that's what people remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|One day <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do his portrait. I {{agreed with}} joy, {{all the more}} so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him in my garden, where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E
6000|$|... "But that isn't {{the same}} thing. I can't always go about with you. Besides <b>he's</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fix my own day, and I'll just go one evening when I'm {{not going out}} with you. It won't make any {{difference}} to you." ...|$|R

2500|$|Friedkin asked Butler {{to be his}} cinematographer on The People vs. Paul Crump, a {{documentary}} that focused on a prisoner who was slated for execution in Illinois. It was a docudrama {{that resulted in the}} governor of Illinois' commuting the prisoner's death sentence. [...] "I was very successful in television, so I had no reason to go into film," [...] Butler said. [...] "But I knew Bill Friedkin was interested in making a film documentary, and he needed a cinematographer. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> assist him. And I did." [...] As a result, Butler's interest shifted from live television to film documentaries. In a 2005 interview, Butler credited Friedkin for giving him his first actual job in the film industry.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{relocated}} to Hiram, Ohio, in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the John Johnson Farm on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: [...] "The next morning I {{went to see}} elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; {{and when he saw}} me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bring his razor. I asked him what he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was a bit surprised when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it. But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} rumoured that Walsh {{was about to}} make a record deal with her band's record label, Fascination Records, {{although}} nothing has been confirmed. Soon after the rumour, Walsh confirmed on Suck My Pop, a programme that she co-hosts on the digital TV station Viva, that she will feature on English rapper Aggro Santos' upcoming single, [...] "Like U Like". The track will be her first step away from Girls Aloud as a singer. Walsh was asked for OK! Magazine: [...] "Kimberley, there are rumours, that you will be releasing a solo album..." [...] and Walsh said: [...] "Gosh! I haven't got any plan to do that. Gary Barlow signed Aggro Santos and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sing Like U Like, and I've done a song for the Horrid Henry film that I'm in titled [...] "Everybody Dance". I'm not sure about doing anything big on my own just yet." [...] In 2012 she made her West End theatre debut, playing Princess Fiona in the London production of Shrek the Musical. The announcement came after Amanda Holden announced her pregnancy in August 2011. Walsh teamed up with Alfie Boe to record a version of Queen's [...] "One Vision" [...] as the Official Olympic Team Great Britain Single. Walsh has also performed with several artists including Neyo with [...] "Hate That I Love You", Ronan Keating's [...] "No Matter What" [...] and James Cullum with [...] "Rainy Days and Mondays".
