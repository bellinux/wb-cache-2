Alexios {{was worried about the}} advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary proliferating Green {{movements}} <b>deeply</b> <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{process of}} globalization and neoliberal politics. With the facilitation of new technology, Green movements seem to become the novel vehicle to transcend the national, class, gender and racial borders. Meanwhile, ecofeminism raises the debates on woman nature nexus and posits woman {{at the forefront of}} fighting environmental crisis. This thesis parallels <b>the</b> two trajectories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temporal and spatial contexts of cyborg space, ???global city??? and international environmental governance. This thesis unfolds the inherent connections, as well as contradictions in these spaces. Through scrutinizing the techniques of subjectivity in Green movements and ecofeminism, it examines the female subjects that are maneuvered, mobilized and displaced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intersectional power dynamics of gender, class, race, sexuality and nationality of the neoliberal politics. Integrating transnational feminism, queer studies and ecofeminism, this thesis endeavors to pave new spaces for rethinking possible grounds for alliances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neoliberal era...|$|R

50|$|The {{theories}} {{regarding the}} dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere can be broadly divided into two classes: shallow and deep. The former hold that the observed circulation is largely confined to a thin outer (weather) layer of the planet, which overlays the stable interior. The latter hypothesis postulates that the observed atmospheric flows are only a surface manifestation of <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> circulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer molecular envelope of Jupiter. As both theories have their own successes and failures, many planetary scientists think that the true theory will include elements of both models.|$|R

25|$|Moreno's second Hollywood feature, Pepe, {{attempted}} {{to replicate the}} success of his first. The film had cameo appearances by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and other stars. His humor, <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spanish language, did not translate well for the American audience and the movie was a notorious box office disappointment. He still earned a Golden Globe nomination for his part. Later in a 1992 American interview, Moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Ceremony {{has been}} called a Grail fiction, wherein the hero overcomes a series of {{challenges}} to reach a specified goal; but this point of view has been criticized as Eurocentric, since it involves a Native American contextualizing backdrop, and not one based on European-American myths.

Fellow Pueblo poet Paula Gunn Allen criticized the book on this account, saying that Silko was divulging secret tribal knowledge reserved for the tribe, not outsiders.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Catholicism in United States is {{historically}} <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-Catholic attitudes of Protestants in Great Britain and Germany after the Reformation. Immigrants brought that hostility {{with them to}} the American colonies. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society and continued into the following centuries. The first, derived from the theological heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the sixteenth century, consisted of the Biblical Anti-Christ and the Whore of Babylon variety and dominated anti-Catholic thought until the late seventeenth century. The second type was a secular variety which derived in part from xenophobic and ethnocentric Nativist sentiments and distrust towards increasing waves of Catholic immigrants, particularly from Ireland, Italy and non-Northwestern European countries, and often focused on the alleged intrigues of Catholic states or Catholic peoples against the majority Protestant United States.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind of Lanying’s family.

She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E

40|$|Beauty {{is not an}} {{independent}} entity. It <b>deeply</b> <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> culture of a particularcommunity. Such a culture is influenced by environmental conditions where thecommunity lives. On that account, beauty poses a social construction created by humanbeings. It changes all <b>the</b> times <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> tastes and interests of thecommunity because it is indeed constructed by <b>the</b> community itself. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Balinesecommunity, it is constructed that woman is considered beautiful if she has physicalbeauty and charming personality (inner beauty). Furthermore, since the modernity engulfs the world, the concept of beauty is morereferring {{to the construction of}} market and capitalistic ideology. The presence ofadvertisement and market does not only offer body care and beauty products, but at thesame time they also offer the concept of ideal woman image. Today, a woman consideredbeautiful if she has white skin, slim body and symmetrical face. Having passed through aseries of battles between capitalism and local values, the concept of beauty puts moreemphasis on physical beauty than any other consideration. Mass media, advertisement,fitness centers and beauty salons become important agents of change. The presence ofcapitalism has resulted in revitalization of Balinese culture, including the beauty ofwomen coming into view not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> religious and customary moment but also inday-to-day life.
