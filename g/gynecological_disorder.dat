40|$|Adenomyosis is {{characterized}} by invasion of endometrial glands and stromal cells into the myometrium. It is a common <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorder</b> that usually occurs in women during their reproductive years. The primary clinical manifestations of adenomyosis are menorrhagia and progressive dysmenorrhea. The pathogenesis of adenomyosis-associated dysmenorrhea is complicated. However, it is predicted that oxytocin, inflammatory factors, and prostaglandin F 2 α are responsible for adenomyosis-associated dysmenorrhea via the induction of uterine smooth muscle contractions. Additionally, the pain conductivity of the pelvic viscera (internal organs) involves both the sympathetic (T 10 –L 1) and parasympathetic (S 2 – 4) nervous systems located in the abdominal region.

40|$|Endometriosis, one of {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring gynecological disorders, is estrogen dependent and is often associated with immunological changes. These include increased macrophage activation and infiltration into the endometriotic implants themselves as well as the peritoneal cavity where the implants often develop. Despite the critical role estrogens play in the development of endometriosis, the biochemical mechanisms of their action remain unclear. In the present study we report that estradiol (E 2) enhances endometriotic cell responsiveness to the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 � by up-regulating interleukin- 1 -induced monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) expression at the level of both protein secretion and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) synthesis, whereas progesterone had no significant effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} and {{degenerative}} disease developing typically in the elderly; nonetheless, {{a condition of}} accelerated atherosclerosis can be observed precociously {{in the presence of}} some diseases. Endometriosis, a chronic benign <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorder,</b> shows some characteristics, such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation and a pro-atherogenic lipid profile, which could increase the risk of developing accelerated atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in young European women with endometriosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 37 women with endometriosis and 31 control subjects. The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis was investigated by ultrasound evaluation of common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD); in addition, serum levels of lipids, inflammatory and coagulation parameters, as well as markers of endothelial inflammation and activation, were determined. RESULTS: Women with endometriosis showed significantly lower values of FMD compared with controls [mean difference: - 4. 62, 95...|$|E

40|$|Endometriosis is a <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorder</b> {{defined by}} the {{presence}} of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. Several studies have found an epidemiological correlation between endometriosis and migraine, probably due to the association of both diseases with female hormones. Progestins or combined oral contraceptives are the first-line medical therapy in women with endometriosis; however, {{it is well known that}} in some women the use of combined oral contraceptives could exacerbate migraine. This observation poses a challenge to clinicians who must concomitantly treat endometriosis- related symptoms and migraine. This review summarizes the available literature on the medical treatment of endometriosis in women suffering concomitant migraine without aura until March 2012. Due to the lack of available studies on this topic, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies evaluating hormonal therapies are needed; in particular, progestin therapy should be reconsidered in women with migraine and concomitant endometriosis...|$|E

Conditional analysis identified five secondary association signals, including two at the ESR 1 locus, resulting in 19 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with endometriosis, which together explain up to 5. 19 % of variance in endometriosis. These results highlight novel variants in or near specific genes with important roles in sex steroid hormone signalling and function, and offer unique opportunities for more targeted functional research efforts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Endometriosis is a <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorder</b> {{characterized}} as the implantation of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Psychological {{symptoms such as}} anxiety, bipolar disorder, depressive symptom and impaired quality of life are common in these women. Sleep quality had not been considered in these women as it should be. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate sleep quality in women with endometriosis. Methods: In this cross-sectional study 61 married women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis asked to fill valid and reliable Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Mean age and mean education level were 31. 4 ± 6. 7 years and 11. 7 ± 3. 1 years, respectively. Dysmenorrhea followed by dyspareunia was the most common symptoms (68. 8 % and 40. 3 %). Mean PSQI score was 6. 1 ± 3. 4, twenty eight (45. 9 %) had PSQI score equal or less than 5 and 33 (54. 1 %) had PSQI score more than 5 (poor sleep). Mean PSQI was significantly different between cases with and without dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. Conclusion: Sleep quality should be considered in women with endometriosis...|$|E

40|$|Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is {{a proinflammatory}} enzyme and a marker for {{neutrophil}} activation and oxidative stress. Since oxidative stress and inflammation {{are linked to}} the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we hypothesized that the total, active, and specific (active/total) MPO levels were significantly different in plasma of women with and without endometriosis. Samples were selected from our biobank from women with endometriosis (n = 212) and controls without endometriosis (n = 121) across the menstrual cycle. Total MPO plasma levels were measured by immunoassay and MPO activity by enzymatic assay. Total and active MPO levels did not differ significantly among endometriosis cases and controls, whereas the specific MPO activity was significantly lower in women with endometriosis than that in controls (p = 0. 0159). After the subdivision of control patients into women with a normal pelvis and women with other benign <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorders,</b> a significant difference was observed only between women with endometriosis and women with other benign <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorders</b> (p = 0. 0266).

40|$|Endometriosis is a {{debilitating}} <b>gynecological</b> <b>disorder</b> with an enigmatic pathogenesis. Current treatment strategy mainly involves surgery and medications, which provide only temporary relief. Endometriosis {{is associated with}} an abnormal inflammatory response, one of the recent pathogenesis is RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) in endometriotic stromal cells, {{which is responsible for}} 70 % of monocyte migration in the peritoneal fluid. This RANTES can be inhibited by the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor system. Thiazolidinediones (PPAR Gamma Agonists) exhibited the ability shown to suppress existing endometriotic lesions without suppressing ovulation. In vivo studies have shown some promising results which could be incorporated in humans. These results have promised new avenues of treatment emerging from older drugs. Since the existing conventional drugs have undesirable side effects, there is always a need for highly efficacious and better tolerated drugs acting through novel mechanisms of action.
