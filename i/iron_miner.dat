His father was an {{agricultural}} worker at that time but had formerly served in the Royal Navy and was later {{to work as a}} coal and <b>iron</b> <b>miner.</b> Macdonald, who adopted the longer spelling of his name in the 1870s, had little formal education as a boy, but in his twenties he attended evening classes, learning Latin and Greek.

He worked as a {{bricklayer}} and an <b>iron</b> <b>miner</b> in the Brazilian States of Amapá and Pará and in French Guiana. Following a positive intradermal leishmanin test, {{he had been given}} 220 meglumine and five pen-tamidine injections in another facility, obtaining poor results. On admission, he presented with an infiltrat-ed, partly ulcerated plaque involving the left ear and adjacent areas (Figure 1). Blood cell counts, FAN, VDRL, FTA-Abs, anti-HIV and anti-HTLV yielded normal/negative results. A biopsy from the pre-auric-ular area showed a tuberculoid granulomatous infil-trate of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasmocytes involving vessels, adnexa, and a nerve (Figure 2).

50|$|House Orlock {{is known}} as the House of Iron because its {{foundations}} lie upon deep ferrous slag pits. This massive resource has led to the largest profession in the house to be miners.

5000|$|In {{the northeastern}} {{section of the}} state, in the region collectively known as the Iron Range, the Mesabi Range area is known for Cornish pasties. The pasty, a meat and {{vegetable}} combination in a pastry crust, was brought to Minnesota by way of early Finnish <b>iron</b> <b>miners</b> as an easy lunch for miners working deep in the iron mines.

The houses in the district are one- and -story gable-roofed buildings of horizontal log construction.

50|$|The {{opening of}} the Bute & Mwyndy iron ore works during the 1850s had {{a huge impact on}} the small hamlet of Groes Faen. The census of 1861 shows that Groes Faen had become a village. Its {{population}} was now 83 people divided in 17 households, of these 83 residents 17 were <b>iron</b> ore <b>miners,</b> meaning that on average each household had 4.9 residents with one being an <b>iron</b> ore <b>miner.</b> The village centre was the pub The Dynefor Arms, and the cottages surrounding it.In the seventies, a nearby quarry was used as a dump for chemicals. In 2007 research began to assess the potential environmental impact of seepage from the Quarry. The Environment Agency summary is at: Monsanto used the quarry for the disposal of PCBs.|$|R

5000|$|Spurred by the 2003 study, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) {{studied the}} {{relationship}} of fibrous minerals in taconite and taconite dust, and lung conditions similar to asbestosis, pleural mesothelioma and other pleural conditions which occur following asbestos exposure. Because these conditions can be triggered by industrial asbestos, which was also used in taconite mining and processing, the study attempted to determine what, if any, influence naturally occurring fibrous minerals in taconite may have played. The lengthy epidemiological study of Minnesota <b>iron</b> <b>miners</b> concluded in December 2014 that those working 30 years in the iron mines had a lifetime chance of having a mesothelioma of 3.33 cases per thousand people, {{more than double the}} background rate of 1.44 cases per thousand people.|$|R

5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among <b>iron</b> <b>miners,</b> and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|R
5000|$|Consequently, Furness, {{instead of}} finding the main line on its doorstep, had to make its own {{arrangements}} to join its local rail network to the national one. Any short connection southwards would necessarily involve a locally financed crossing of Morecambe Bay {{and this was a}} daunting prospect [...] - [...] the quicksands and fierce tides of the bay are still notorious. The 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster reminded many people of the dangers. Nevertheless the <b>iron</b> <b>miners</b> needed a good connection in order to make their product competitive. The directors of the Furness Railway were not in a hurry to take it on so it was promoted by John Brogden and Sons, a Manchester-based firm of railway contractors and promoters who had expanded into iron mining activity in the Furness area.|$|R
