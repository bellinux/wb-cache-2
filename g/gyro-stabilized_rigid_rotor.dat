50|$|Lockheed began {{developing}} its <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> concept with the CL-475 helicopter design in 1959. The {{choice of a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> meant that the helicopter was more agile {{than it would have}} been with a flapping rotor. The performance of the CL-475 encouraged Lockheed to seek further development. Lockheed submitted the CL-475 to the Army as a candidate to replace the Bell OH-13 Sioux and Hiller OH-23 Raven observation helicopters. Lockheed also tested the commercial market waters without success. However, in February 1962, Lockheed's Model 186, a new design based on the CL-475 <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor,</b> was selected as the winner for a joint Army-Navy program to evaluate the <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> for high-speed flight capability.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "rigid rotor" [...] usually {{refers to}} a {{hingeless}} rotor system [...] with blades flexibly attached to the hub. Irv Culver of Lockheed developed {{one of the first}} <b>rigid</b> <b>rotors,</b> which was tested and developed on a series of helicopters in the 1960s and 1970s. In a <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> system, each blade flaps and drags about flexible sections of the root. A <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> system is mechanically simpler than a fully articulated rotor system. Loads from flapping and lead/lag forces are accommodated through rotor blades flexing, rather than through hinges. By flexing, the blades themselves compensate for the forces that previously required rugged hinges. The result is a rotor system that has less lag in control response because of the large hub moment typically generated. The <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> system thus eliminates the danger of mast bumping inherent in teetering rotors.|$|R
