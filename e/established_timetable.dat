5000|$|Deviations {{from the}} {{timetable}} operation would be enacted through train orders sent {{from the train}} dispatcher to block operators. These orders would override the <b>established</b> <b>timetable</b> priorities and provide trains with explicit {{instructions on how to}} run. Train orders consisted of two types, Protection and Authority. Protective train orders would be used to ensure that no trains would be at risk of colliding with another along the line. Once the protective orders had been delivered to block operators (who might in turn pass them on to the train crews), an authority could be issued to a train to move over the line where protection had been established. Normally the timetable established both protection and authority for scheduled trains so train orders were only used for extra trains, which were not in the timetable, and scheduled trains moving contrary to their normal authorities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to supply a {{freeware}} PC-based CAD environment (named WinVLSI) {{for the design of}} full-custom VLSI microelectronic circuits, from schematic capture to foundry database, for educational purposes. There are two problems related with CAD laboratories for microelectronic design education: (i) the high cost of the required hardware and the high cost of annual license maintenance for the available microelectronic CAD and (ii) the time consuming training of both the CAD software and the UNIX system. Usually students are more familiar using a PC-environment than a UNIX-environment and this is directly related with the efficiency on time used for doing the practical work. In order to overrule this problem a freeware PC-based CAD environment is being used for the design of analog integrated circuits during two courses for the electronic engineering studies. Additionally with WinVLSI, students are able to do the laboratory design work from their home, this is especially interesting for students who can not assist to <b>established</b> <b>timetable.</b> Finally the PC-based CAD environment will help to spread the microelectronic design skills for recycling engineers who {{will be able to use}} that environment from their home. 2.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research study which had the objective of investigating the effect of a sprinkler system coupled with forced ventilation on the heat stress of dairy cows bred in a free stall barn without paddock. To this aim, an experiment was carried out inside a free-stall dairy house equipped with two different cooling systems: a fogging system associated with forced ventilation in the resting area and a sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation in the feeding alley. The experiment regarded two adjacent pens of the barn and was constituted by three different trials carried out in the following periods: 27 th June - 7 th July (P 1), 25 th July - 4 th August (P 2), 24 th August - 3 rd September (P 3). The experimental protocol of each trial required that the treatment group was housed in one pen where the two cooling systems were always activated following an <b>established</b> <b>timetable,</b> whereas the control group was housed in the other pen, where the sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation was always deactivated. Climatic parameters were measured inside each pen of the barn and outside. Then, thermal humidity index (THI) was calculated. Rectal temperature and respiration rate of a sample of dairy cows were monitored each day during the three periods considered (P 1, P 2 and P 3). During the three trials the cows of both groups were subjected to climatic conditions that resulted in average daily THI values between 72. 8 and 74. 7, corresponding to mild or moderate heat stress. However, during daytime, air temperature and relative humidity reached values corresponding to a severe heat stress, as attested by the maximum THI values that were higher than or very close to 80. Furthermore, it was observed that the sprinklers do not influence the microclimatic conditions. However, the physiological parameters values of the treatment group were always significantly lower than the corresponding ones of the control group. Specifically, the system especially influenced the respiration rate that, in the treatment group, was close to 50 breath/min, while in the control group it reached 70 breath/min. The sprinkler system had more limited effects on rectal temperature that, however, in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group (38. 7 °C to 38. 8 °C vs 39. 1 °C to 39. 4 °C) in all the three periods of the experiment. These results show that the sprinkler system could be useful to mitigate heat stress in dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|In a hard-hitting report {{released}} on the August 22 nd 2002, Oxfam UK criticised the EU sugar regime for destroying livelihoods {{in developing countries}} such as Mozambique (not a traditional beneficiary of ACP sugar preferences, although a recent beneficiary of EBA sugar access). While recognising the benefits gained by ACP countries from the existing EU sugar regime, the Oxfam report highlighted the anomaly {{of one of the}} least efficient sugar producers being one of the world's leading refined sugar exporters. The report argues that the EU's sugar export regime encourages the supply of high cost EU sugar to the world market (with the benefit of export refunds) in ways which depress the world market price and undermine the development of competitive sugar production and value added sugar processing in developing countries. The report also highlight the exceptionally high profits generated by sugar sector millers that are virtual monopoly producers in many EU member states. The case of British Sugar in the UK which, {{as a result of the}} current EU sugar regime, makes exceptionally high profits compared to other food-sector enterprises in the same corporate family, was highlighted. Oxfam's immediate call was for an end to subsidised EU sugar exports and for additional market access for LDC and ACP suppliers. The web site of the Sugar Traders Associations of the United Kingdom maintained that this demand was not 'inconsistent with keeping a higher price in Europe than on the world market in order to permit remunerative prices for sugar growers'. Comment: Oxfam's call to end subsidised exports needs to be seen against the background of the CAP mid-term review's renewed emphasis on moving over to an extended system of de-coupled farm support, which would cover a wide range of products and leave farmers involved in the scheme free to choose which crops to grow depending on market signals. Such an ultimate objective would inevitably require a substantial reduction in the EU sugar price, perhaps by amounts similar to those currently being proposed in the rice sector. While there is no suggestion that sugar should be included in this multi-product system in the short term, beyond 2007 it is evident that the European Commission would like to see sugar included in this single multi-product scheme of de-coupled farm support. The web site of the Sugar Traders Association of the UK draws an analogy between future developments in the EU sugar sector and current proposals for reform of the EU rice regime. With an <b>established</b> <b>timetable</b> for the phasing in of duty free access for least-developed-country sugar exports and a challenge to the EU sugar regime in the WTO being mounted which would limit the EU's capacity to dispose of sugar on world markets with the benefit of export refunds, an acute market situation similar to that currently faced on the EU rice market could in due course emerge in the EU sugar market. A shift towards increased direct aid-payments to EU sugar-beet farmers linked to a dramatic reduction in the EU sugar price beyond 2006 should not therefore be ruled out. In a hard-hitting {{report released}} on the August [...] ...|$|E
