In 1995, Midway had {{flights to}} Boston, Hartford, Long Island, Newark, Newburgh, New York, Philadelphia and Washington in the Northeast, and to Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach in Florida. American subleased its gates at RDU to Midway {{in order to}} repay $113million in American-guaranteed bonds which {{had been used to}} construct the hub facilities. Midway suspended service for some time after the September 11, 2001 attacks, ceased operations in 2002 and filed for bankruptcy in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a <b>hub</b> <b>carrier,</b> with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name Hamburg Airport „Helmut Schmidt“ (IATA: HAM, ICAO: EDDH) {{is the fifth}} biggest and oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912 and located about [...] from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like Newark, New Jersey on United Airlines, Dubai on Emirates, and Tehran on Iran Air; Lufthansa is the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier,</b> with the most flights and [...] operates one of its biggest maintenance facilities at the Hamburg airport (Lufthansa Technik). The second airport is located in Hamburg-Finkenwerder, official name Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (IATA: XFW, ICAO: EDHI). It is about [...] from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the Airbus plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after Toulouse, and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after Seattle and Toulouse; the plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A320, A321 and A380 aircraft.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{studying}} the medium and long run dynamic effects of horizontal mergers. Our method builds on the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007). Policy functions are estimated on historical pre-merger data, and then future industry outcomes are simulated both with and without the proposed merger. In our airline entry model, an airline’s entry/exit decisions are made jointly across route segments, and depend on features of its own route network {{as well as the}} networks of the other airlines. We also allow for city-specific profitability shocks that affect all route segments out of a given city, as well as segment-specific shocks. Using data for 2003 - 2008, we apply our model to three recently proposed airline mergers. We find that a merger between two major <b>hub</b> <b>carriers</b> leads to increased entry by the other <b>hub</b> <b>carriers,</b> and can lead to substantial increased entry by low cost carriers, both effects offsetting some of the initial concentrating effects of the merger. Our model also suggests that a merger between two <b>hub</b> <b>carriers</b> can in certain cases lead to dismantling of a hub. ∗This draft is preliminary and incomplete.

50|$|Each {{lower link}} is {{fabricated}} from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} lower link pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} <b>hub</b> <b>carrier.</b> The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} differential casing. Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier.</b> This prevents the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|E

50|$|A 47%/53% front/rear weight {{distribution}} {{was achieved by}} setting the engine behind the front axle, inside the wheelbase (front-mid-engine layout) and {{the adoption of a}} transaxle layout. With the later automatic transmission - fitted in the conventional position in block with the engine - {{weight distribution}} changed to 49%/51% front/rear.The suspension system consists of unequal length control arms with forged aluminium arms and <b>hub</b> <b>carriers,</b> coil springs and anti-roll bars on both axles.|$|R
50|$|A MacPherson strut uses a wishbone, or a {{substantial}} compression link stabilized by a secondary link, {{which provides a}} bottom mounting point for the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> or axle of the wheel. This lower arm system provides both lateral and longitudinal location of the wheel. The {{upper part of the}} <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> is rigidly fixed {{to the bottom of the}} outer part of the strut proper; this slides up and down the inner part of it, which extends upwards directly to a mounting in the body shell of the vehicle. The line from the strut's top mount to the bottom ball joint on the control arm gives the steering axis inclination. The strut's axis may be angled inwards from the steering axis at the bottom, to clear the tyre; this makes the bottom follow an arc when steering.|$|E

50|$|Brakes {{were the}} same across the range using a hub {{integrated}} (i.e. not a hat rotor) front ventilated disc design of 287 mm and single piston callipers sliding on the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier.</b> The rear used solid discs also at 287 mm and the rear callipers carried over the Ford handbrake system using a threaded piston applying the handbrake cable forces to the rear disc pads.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and radius arm configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. Rear <b>hub</b> <b>carriers</b> were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} double-wishbone front suspension {{was replaced}} with a dual joint multilink design, with an all-electric system. To increase rigidity and lower unsprung weight, forged aluminum is now used for the suspension links, front steering knuckles, and rear <b>hub</b> <b>carriers.</b> along with a single-piece hollow die-cast aluminum front subframe with machined mounting points, and {{approximately half of the}} body uses high-tensile steel. Overall the amount of laser welding has been doubled compared to the previous model.|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{on market}} power conferred by airport {{dominance}} and the debates of hub premiums have attracted longstanding attention from governments and academics alike.

40|$|We examine {{two factors}} that explain air traffic congestion: network {{benefits}} due to hubbing and congestion externalities. While both factors impact congestion, {{we find that}} the hubbing effect dominates empirically. <b>Hub</b> <b>carriers</b> incur most of the additional travel time from hubbing, primarily because they cluster their flights in short time spans to provide passengers as many potential connections as possible with a minimum of waiting time. Non-hub flights at the same hub airports operate with minimal additional travel time. These results suggest that an optimal congestion tax might have a relatively small impact on flight patterns at hub airports. (JEL L 2, L 5, L 9, D 6) ...|$|R

50|$|As it {{requires}} a drive shaft, the Chapman strut can only be used at the driven end of the vehicle. For the Lotus designs to which it was applied, this was their rear. MacPherson struts are most commonly used for front suspension and the strut axis forms the kingpin bearing, for steering movement. There is little reason why a Chapman strut {{could not be used}} similarly, although there is no record of this being tried on a front-wheel or four-wheel drive car. Both designs are struts, where the strut base is rigidly attached to the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Four {{wheel drive}} for heavy {{vehicles}} {{in this period}} was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the steering joints of the front axle. Rather than the common system of articulated drive shafts to the front hubs (the shaft either inside an axle casing or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the axle casing carried power {{to the ends of}} the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself.|$|E
50|$|H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 Runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an {{independent}} front suspension system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide {{up and down a}} fixed pillar that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tire and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.|$|E

(2) In general, Taiwanese airports and airlines have benefited more from liberalization compared to airports and airlines on the mainland and Hong Kong. Such asymmetric effect {{is due to the}} larger size of the Mainland Chinese aviation market, which allows Taiwanese airlines to exploit network-related benefits.

50|$|In 1987, the Honda Civic was {{significantly}} redesigned for model year 1988. The suspension had a radical re-configuration with double-wishbone suspension {{in the front}} and an independent suspension in the rear, wheelbase was increased to 98.4 inches (250 cm), and the body was redesigned with a lower hood line and more glass, giving less drag. The front suspension incorporates an extended <b>hub</b> <b>carrier,</b> so the upper arm is relatively short. The rear suspension is a multi-link trailing arm suspension with upper and lower lateral control links (with the spring/damper strut carried on the lower link) near the axle line and a short lateral link for toe control ahead of the pivot of the main trailing arm.|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the Rover 2000 was {{the design of the}} front {{suspension}} system, in which a bell crank (an L-shaped rotating bracket trailing the upper <b>hub</b> <b>carrier</b> joint) conveyed the vertical motion of the wheel to a fore-and-aft-horizontally mounted spring fastened to the rear wall of the engine compartment. A single hydraulically damped arm was mounted on the firewall for the steering.The front suspension was designed to allow as much width for the engine compartment as possible so that Rover's Gas Turbine engine could be fitted. In the event, the engine was never used for the production vehicle, but the engine compartment width facilitated the accommodation of the V8 engine adopted years after the P6's initial launch.|$|E
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end.

5000|$|For {{the first}} 32 years of {{production}} {{of the first generation}} IRS, the disc brakes were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end. The hydraulic brake calipers were mounted directly onto the differential. Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful. [...] The parking brake used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.For the 1993-1996 model XJS, the brakes were moved to the outboard position. This was achieved using the <b>hub</b> <b>carriers</b> from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the XJ6 (XJ40).
