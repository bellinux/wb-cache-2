We postulated {{that the following}} two hypotheses may be applicable for juvenile fishes associate with drifting seaweeds, the “concentration of food supply” hypothesis: juvenile fishes are attracted by phytal animals on the drifting seaweeds and the “indicator-log” hypothesis: fish use accumulations of drifting seaweed {{as an indicator of}} productive <b>areas</b> (e. g. <b>frontal</b> <b>areas)</b> for food. We investigated the <b>frontal</b> <b>areas,</b> zooplankton abundance around the drifting seaweed, and the food availability of fish juveniles associated with drifting seaweed accumulations in the East China Sea in 2012 and 2013. A total of 14 drifting seaweed mass and 22 species (n = 408) of fish juveniles were collected. We found that 49. 7 - 99. 7 % of the individual fed on planktonic food and the feeding incidence on phytal animals was less than 50 %. Although drifting seaweeds were aggregated around the <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> of surface currents, the zooplankton abundance was not significantly different between these <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> and other areas. Our findings indicate that ecological significance of drifting seaweeds as feeding habit is relatively low for juvenile fishes associated with drifting seaweeds. 流れ藻には多くの水産上重要種の稚魚が付随するが，流れ藻の稚魚にとっての生態学的意義は明らかにされていない。筆者らは次の 2 仮説のいずれかが流れ藻付随稚魚に当てはまると考え，“concentration of food supply hypothesis”（流れ藻葉上生物を摂餌するため）と“indicator log hypothesis”（流れ藻をフロント域のような餌豊度の高い海域の目印とするため）を検証するため， 2012 年と 2013 年に東シナ海の流れ藻周辺の海洋環境，フロント域，動物プランクトン豊度，流れ藻付随稚魚の摂餌個体率を調べた。流れ藻は表層流の収束帯に集積されていたが，収束帯のプランクトン豊度は高くなかった。合計 14 個の流れ藻を採集し，合計 22 種（ 408 尾）の稚魚の胃内容物を調査した結果，稚魚の 49. 7 - 99. 7 %の個体はプランクトンを選択的に摂餌していたが，葉上生物の摂餌個体率は高くなかった（ 50 %未満）。以上の結果から流れ藻の稚魚にとっての生態学的意義は摂餌場でないことが示唆された...|$|R

40|$|Semantic {{retrieval}} consistently activates left inferior frontal regions, yet lesions {{to these}} areas do not typically result in semantic deficits. This discrepancy {{has led to}} the hypothesis that left prefrontal areas are primarily involved in executive processes while semantic information is retrieved from temporal cortices. We investigated semantic executive processing by changing, over trials, the semantic association to a stimulus. Using fMRI and PET, we demonstrate that changes in semantic association increased activation in temporal as well as <b>frontal</b> <b>areas.</b> The similar effects in temporal and <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> suggest that semantic executive processes are not confined to the left inferior frontal cortex but might be distributed throughout the semantic system...|$|R
40|$|We were {{interested}} in gaining insight into the functional properties of frontal networks based upon their anatomical inputs.

40|$|The dorsal, parietal visual {{stream is}} {{activated}} when seeing objects, but {{the exact nature}} of parietal object representations is still under discussion. Here we test 2 specific hypotheses. First, parietal cortex is biased to host some representations more than others, with a different bias compared with ventral areas. A prime example would be object action representations. Second, parietal cortex forms a general multiple-demand network with <b>frontal</b> <b>areas,</b> showing similar task effects and representational content compared with <b>frontal</b> <b>areas.</b> To differentiate between these hypotheses, we implemented a human neuroimaging study with a stimulus set that dissociates associated object action from object category while manipulating task context to be either action- or category-related. Representations in parietal as well as prefrontal areas represented task-relevant object properties (action representations in the action task), with no sign of the irrelevant object property (category representations in the action task). In contrast, irrelevant object properties were represented in ventral areas.

40|$|Numerosity and {{duration}} processing have been modeled by a functional mechanism taking {{the form of}} an accumulator working under two different operative modes. Separate investigations of their cerebral substrates have revealed partly similar patterns of activation, mainly in parietal and <b>frontal</b> <b>areas.</b> However, the precise cerebral implementation of the accumulator model within these areas has not yet been directly assessed. In this study, we asked participants to categorize the numerosity of flashed dot sequences or the duration of single dot displays, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the common neural correlates of these processes. The results reveal a large right-lateralized fronto-parietal network, including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and areas in the precentral, middle and superior frontal gyri, which is activated by both numerosity {{and duration}} processing. Complementary psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses show a functional connectivity between the right IPS and the <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> in both tasks, whereas the right IPS was functionally connected to the left IPS and the right precentral area in the numerosity categorization task only. We propose that the right IPS underlies a common magnitude processing system for both numerosity and duration, possibly corresponding to the encoding and accumulation stages of the accumulator model, whereas the <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> are involved in subsequent working-memory storage and decision-making processes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Two-row designs often had cooling problems with the rear bank of cylinders, but a variety of baffles and fins were introduced that largely eliminated these problems. The downside was a relatively large <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> that had to be left open to provide enough airflow, which increased drag.

25|$|A fit adult {{creates a}} wake. Drag {{due to a}} wake is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} with {{the square of the}} velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and <b>frontal</b> <b>area,</b> yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E
25|$|The F40 was {{designed}} with aerodynamics in mind. For speed the car relied more on its shape than its power. <b>Frontal</b> <b>area</b> was reduced, and airflow greatly smoothed, but stability rather than terminal velocity was a primary concern.

It had a partial undertray to smooth airflow beneath the radiator, front section, and the cabin, and a second one with diffusers behind the motor, but the engine bay was not sealed. Nonetheless, the F40 had an impressively low drag coefficient of 0.34 with lift controlled by its spoilers and wing.|$|E

25|$|Memory is {{required}} in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and <b>frontal</b> cortical <b>areas</b> for working memory in music appreciation. This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks. Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs, and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes. These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.|$|R
50|$|Joseph LeDoux focuses {{much of his}} {{research}} on the emotion fear. Fear can be evoked by two systems in the brain, both involving the thalamus and the amygdala: one old, short and fast, the other more recently evolved, more circuitous and slower. In the older system, sensory information travels directly and quickly from the thalamus to the amygdala where it elicits the autonomic and motor responses we call fear. In the younger system, sensory information travels from the thalamus to the relevant cortical sensory areas (touch to the somatosensory cortex, vision to the visual cortex, etc.) and on to <b>frontal</b> association <b>areas,</b> where appraisal occurs. These <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> communicate directly with the amygdala and, in light of appraisal, may reduce or magnify the amygdala's fear response. If you glimpse {{what looks like a}} snake, long before your younger <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> have had time to determine it is a stick, the old thalamus-amygdala system will have evoked fear. LeDoux hypothesizes that the old fast system persists because a behavioral response at the first hint of danger is of little consequence when mistaken but may mean {{the difference between life and}} death when appropriate.|$|R
