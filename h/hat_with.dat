5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a violet <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on each side.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the box was a hole {{perhaps an}} inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most {{marvelous}} picture.

25|$|Hard {{felt hats}} {{are made by}} {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and felt <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. <b>Hats</b> <b>with</b> 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. Felt <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide brimmed felt <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear felt <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> very small brims, the present day fashion tending {{to do away with the}} brim altogether.|$|R

SpongeBob was designed to be a child-like character who was goofy and optimistic in a style similar to that made famous by Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} regiment's life, the 52nd Foot wore {{traditional}} British Army red coats, with buff facings. During the American wars, {{the coat}} was long tailed, with buff facings, buff waistcoat and breeches. The grenadier company wore a bearskin <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> the King's Crest and the regimental number. Officers wore crimson sash, gorget and silver epaulettes.|$|E

The business owner is bearded and wears a crocus flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the caduceus, the staff carried by Hermes Trismegistus in Egyptian mythology and Hermes in Greek mythology. In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses.|$|E

5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup {{in the third}} round and are drawn {{randomly}} out of a <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn, a replay comes into force, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her thighs during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E

This was the first season that The Football Association introduced guidelines to prevent the withdrawal of clubs from the competition. The final was scheduled a week before the final weekend of the Premier League, to aid any successful club playing European football.|$|E
5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. It was first held in 1871–72 with only 15 teams entering; {{the growth of}} the sport and changes to the competition's {{structure}} meant that by 2000, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn it is replayed, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In the case of Arsenal, all but one of their ties (fourth round) was televised to the British audience.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the <b>HAT,</b> <b>with</b> several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a <b>hat</b> <b>with</b> a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|The quest {{begins when}} Link is {{chosen by the}} king of Hyrule to seek {{the help of the}} Picori after Vaati had {{destroyed}} the Picori Blade and petrified Princess Zelda. With the blade shattered, evil monsters were released into Hyrule and Vaati was able to create chaos in his search for the Light Force. Link was chosen because only children can see the Picori. On the voyage he rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green cap with a bird-like head, who joins him and can make Link shrink {{to the size of the}} Minish. Although it is not revealed at first, he and Vaati are Minish (Picori)—Ezlo a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati his apprentice. Vaati became corrupted by the madness and hatred of men and took a magic hat Ezlo had made for the people in Hyrule. The hat grants any wish made by the bearer, and Vaati wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned his old master, who had tried to stop them, into a <b>hat.</b> <b>With</b> the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and uses them to restore the Picori Blade to the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati.|$|E

50|$|In most British regiments {{prior to}} 1914, certain Regimental Staff {{officers}} in full-dress uniform wore cocked hats {{in place of}} the usual regimental headdress. Since then, the use of full dress has been largely restricted to the Household Division, which maintains the tradition: quartermasters wear cocked <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> a feather of regimental colour, whilst Veterinary Officers and Medical Officers wear cocked <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> a red feather plume and black feather plume respectively.|$|R

5000|$|For several decades, all NFL {{officials}} wore white hats. In 1979, {{the referees}} changed to black <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> white stripes, {{while the other}} officials continued to wear white ones. Finally, in 1988, the NFL switched to the high-school and college football style: the referee wears a white hat (which now includes the NFL logo, first added for Super Bowl XXXIX), and the other officials wear black <b>hats</b> <b>with</b> white stripes. This has led to referees being referred to as [...] "white hats".|$|R
