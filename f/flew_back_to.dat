5|$|In 1972, {{sessions}} for the album started, with recording {{taking place at}} three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica: Dynamic Sound, Harry J's and Randy's. Engineer Sylvan Morris put the songs on eight-track tape, and allocated tracks with the drum mixes on one track and piano and guitar together on another. In the winter of 1972, Marley <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London to present the master tapes. The deal with Island led to a dispute with CBS and Sims, to whom the band were already contracted. The Island Records label won the resulting court case, and it received US$9,000 and two percent of royalties from the band's first six albums, and Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} saw the notable loss of Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Weber, {{commander}} of III./JG 1 {{who was shot}} down and killed by Mustangs. It was from Le Mans that JG 1 started to perform fighter-bomber (Jagdbomber or Jabo) missions, even though I. nor II./JG 1 had any specialised training. On 8 June 1944 both gruppen were sent off on ground-attack missions. 25 Fw 190s of II./JG 1 attacked Allied shipping off the Normandy coast unmolested. RAF aircraft bombed Le Mans airfield {{on the night of}} 9 June, resulting in II./JG 1 losing seven aircraft and five damaged. Oberleutnant Rüdiger von Kirchmayr <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> 4./JG 1 after hospitalization on 12 June in Störmede, and en route he was attacked by Spitfires over Flers, claiming an unconfirmed kill as a result. There was a follow-up bombing attack on 15 June resulting in a loss of two more Fw 190s.|$|E

5|$|While at Deraa on 21 September {{during his}} {{withdrawal}} from Nazareth to Damascus, Liman von Sanders ordered the Fourth Army to withdraw. They were to move {{without waiting for}} the II Corps/Southern Force, which had also begun to withdraw north from Ma'an and the southern Hejaz railway. The army was in general moving northwards from Amman along the railway towards Deraa by 22 September, where they were ordered to form a rearguard line from Deraa to Irbid. Aerial reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Ottoman army withdrawal from Amman towards Deraa. Ottoman units in the hills to the south west, and a column of all arms, were seen moving from the Es Salt area towards Amman. The aircraft bombed and machine gunned this column, then <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> report at Ramleh.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham still flew on operations. Flying the new Beaufighter II {{powered by}} Merlin engines on an {{interception}} in July, {{he was hit}} by return fire from a He 111. The engines spluttered and one caught fire. Already far out to sea he <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> base, extinguished the fire and made a wheels-down landing. The following month he had greater success. On the night of the 22 August 1941 he intercepted two He 111s. One was claimed as damaged but the second was confirmed. The Heinkel He 111, an H-5 model, Werknummer 4081, coded F8+BS belonging to 8./Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40), fell into the sea north-west of Wells, Somerset at 22.05. Gefreiter G. Dohmen, H. Hädrich, and K. Dändel were never found. The body of Rudolf Faath was washed ashore at Burnham Overy on 31 August. On 1 September Cunningham caught and downed a Ju 88—his 15th victory. He was awarded a bar to his DFC on 19 September, by which time he was an acting wing commander.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both the new constitution and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the new constitution in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a cinéma vérité style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting {{with the film}} team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior shots in the city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome. Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City. During principal filming with Kerman, {{the father of the}} actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Bogotá to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} {{tempered}} this achievement. Despite shooting down two more aircraft, {{it was the}} first time he had lost his wingman. Unteroffizier Johann Kalb had to bail out over the Volga River and was captured by Soviet troops. On 17 September he claimed three more victories but a 20mm Soviet cannon-shell went through his canopy, narrowly missing his head. On 23 September, he scored a remarkable ten victories in three missions, taking him to 197. On 26 September, he became the first pilot in aviation history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down. The 62 victories he claimed in that single month (of September) remain a record unbeaten in aviation history. Elevated to hero status by the Luftwaffe, he was promoted to Major on 29 September and forbidden from flying further combat missions. The whole of JG52 gathered at Soldatskaja to congratulate him before he <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Berlin a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Partition of India in 1947, Manekshaw's unit, the 4th {{battalion}} of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, {{became part of}} the Pakistan Army, so Manekshaw was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. While handling the issues relating to partition in 1947, Manekshaw demonstrated his sound planning and administrative skills in his capacity as GSO1. At the end of 1947, Manekshaw was posted as the commanding officer of the 3rd {{battalion of}} 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force). However, before he moved on to his new appointment, on 22 October, Pakistani forces infiltrated Kashmir, capturing Domel and Muzaffarabad. The following day, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, appealed for India to send troops. But the Indian government replied that they would send troops only if Jammu and Kashmir acceded and became part of India. On 25 October, V. P. Menon, then-political advisor to the Viceroy of India, along with Manekshaw flew to Srinagar, with the Instrument of Accession. While Menon was with the Maharaja, Manekshaw carried out an aerial survey of the situation in Kashmir. After the Maharaja had signed the document, they <b>flew</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Delhi the same night. Soon a briefing was held with Lord Mountbatten, and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, where Manekshaw suggested immediate deployments of troops to save Kashmir from being captured.|$|E
