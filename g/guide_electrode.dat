Using computational modeling, we predicted the dosimetric impact of post-treatment 90 Y PET/CT-guided percutaneous ablation of the portions of a tumor receiving the lowest absorbed dose. A cohort of fourteen patients with non-resectable liver cancer previously treated using 90 Y radioembolization were included in this retrospective study. Each patient exhibited potentially under-treated areas of tumor following treatment based on quantitative 90 Y PET/CT. 90 Y PET/CT was used to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> placement for simulated adjuvant radiofrequency ablation in areas of tumor receiving the lowest dose. The finite element method was used to solve Penne’s bioheat transport equation, coupled with the Arrhenius thermal cell-death model to determine 3 D thermal ablation zones. Tumor and unablated tumor absorbed-dose metrics (average dose, D 50, D 70, D 90, V 100) following ablation were compared, where D 70 is the minimum dose to 70 % of tumor and V 100 is the fractional tumor volume receiving more than 100  Gy.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the magnitude of}} an impulsive voltage on the propagation of a guided surface discharge is well known, as is the miluence of the magnitude and polarity of surface charge. In this study it has been observed that the propagation of the discharge is retarded by the presence of DDot probes inserted into the underlying <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> that act as the conductor return. This is observed as a reduction in the discharge current at the time when the discharge head is in the proximity of the probes. The effect is observed for all impulse voltages investigated and for both polarity combinations of initiating impulse voltage and surface charge. The duration of the initiating pulse is such that it is only present for the initial period of the discharge propagation and consequently thereafter the energy to drive the discharge is provided by charge stored on the insulator surface. It is therefore concluded that the observed effect is associated with charge distribution in the neighbourhood of the probe...|$|E

Study Design: Ex vivo animal study combined with computer modeling to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> placement and polarity selection. Methods: Rabbit costal cartilages were secured in a jig that approximated {{the shape of}} the rabbit auricle framework. Fi-nite element modeling was used to select the initial electrode geometry, polarity, spacing, and estimate dosimetry parameters. Porcine costal cartilage was utilized to refine the selection of dosing parameters. Parametric analysis was performed to deter-mine the effect of voltage and application time on tissue shape change. Next, rabbit rib cartilage was reshaped, varying volt-age and application time to identify the lowest parameters to produce acceptable shape change mimicking native auricular cartilage. Acceptable qualitative shape change was determined on a five-point Likert scale analyzed using one-way general linear analysis of variance. Confocal microscopy with live/dead cell viability analysis determined the degree of injury and the distribution of live and dead cells. Results: The minimum acceptable deformation of rabbit costal cartilage was found at 4 V– 3 minutes. Viability analysis of cartilage reshaped at 4 V– 3 minutes demonstrates cell injury extending 2 mm away from each electrode with viable cells found between the electrodes. Conclusions: The EMR parameters of 4 V– 3 minutes demonstrates appropriate shape change producing grafts that resemble the native auricle and contains the viable cells adequate for clinical evaluation.

Previous studies in the rat and pig have shown that controlled necrosis can be safely produced by inserting platinum electrodes into normal liver' parenchyma and liver tumours. As with any new treatment it is mandatory to investigate the 'worst-case scenario' of inadvertent intravascular electrode placement in a large animal model before progressing to clinical trials. METHODS: Under ultrasound control in six pigs, electrodes were inserted into, or immediately adjacent to, an hepatic vein. An electrolytic 'dose' of 100 C was then administered {{and the evolution of}} the lesion was monitored using ultrasound. Venous blood was collected before and during the electrolysis to evaluate potential acid/base disturbances and animals were closely monitored during electrolysis and during their recovery until a full autopsy was performed 4 - 7 days after treatment. RESULTS: Gas bubbles were seen to enter the hepatic veins or interior vena cava during treatment in five of the six animals. There were no major complications as a consequence and all animals recovered and remained in a healthy state until they were killed. At autopsy one animal had complete thrombotic occlusion of the left hepatic vein. Otherwise, findings were normal. CONCLUSION: In the clinical setting, due to the use of ultrasound to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> placement into the centre of a tumour, the electrodes should rarely juxtapose an hepatic vein. Nevertheless, in this extreme situation, electrolysis is surprisingly safe with only one major vascular occlusion and no morbidity or mortality...|$|E
40|$|Multipuncture {{radiofrequency}} ablation {{is expected}} to produce a large ablated area and reduce intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it requires considerable skill. This study evaluated the utility of a new simulator system for multipuncture radiofrequency ablation. To understand positioning of multipuncture electrodes on three-dimensional images, we developed a new technology by expanding real-time virtual ultrasonography. We performed 21 experimental punctures in phantoms. Electrode insertion directions and positions were confirmed on computed tomography, and accuracy and utility of the simulator system were evaluated by measuring angles and intersections for each electrode. Moreover, to appropriately assess placement of the three electrodes, puncture procedures {{with or without the}} simulator were performed by experts and non-experts. Technical success was defined as maximum angle and distance ratio, as calculated by maximum and minimum distances between electrodes. In punctures using 2 electrodes, correlations between angles on each imaging modality were strong (ultrasound vs. simulator: r = 0. 991, p< 0. 001, simulator vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 991, p< 0. 001, ultrasound vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 999, p< 0. 001). Correlations between distances in each imaging modality were also strong (ultrasound vs. simulator: r = 0. 993, p< 0. 001; simulator vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 994, p< 0. 001; ultrasound vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 994, p< 0. 001). In cases with 3 electrodes, distances between each electrode correlated strongly (yellow-labeled vs. red-labeled: r = 0. 980, p< 0. 001; red-labeled vs. blue-labeled: r = 0. 953, p< 0. 001; yellow-labeled vs. blue-labeled: r = 0. 953, p< 0. 001).

We report microelectrode data from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and globus pallidus externa (GPe) in children undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for dystonia and investigate whether GPi and GPe firing rates differ between dystonia types. METHODS: Single pass microelectrode data were obtained to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> position in 44 children (3. 3 - 18. 1  years, median 10. 7) with the following dystonia types: 14 primary, 22 secondary Static and 8 progressive secondary to neuronal brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Preoperative stereotactic MRI determined coordinates for the GPi target. Digitised spike trains were analysed offline, blind to clinical data. Electrode placement was confirmed by a postoperative stereotactic CT scan. FINDINGS: We identified 263 GPi and 87 GPe cells. Both GPi and GPe firing frequencies differed significantly with dystonia aetiology. The median GPi firing frequency was higher in the primary group than in the secondary static group (13. 5  Hz vs 9. 6  Hz; p= 0. 002) and higher in the NBIA group than in either the primary (25  Hz vs 13. 5  Hz; p= 0. 006) or the secondary static group (25  Hz vs 9. 6  Hz; p= 0. 00004). The median GPe firing frequency was higher in the NBIA group than in the secondary static group (15. 9  Hz vs 7  Hz; p= 0. 013). The NBIA group also showed {{a higher proportion of}} regularly firing GPi cells compared with the other groups (p< 0. 001). A higher proportion of regular GPi cells was also seen in patients with fixed/tonic dystonia compared with a phasic/dynamic dystonia phenotype (p< 0. 001). The GPi firing frequency showed a positive correlation with 1 -year outcome from DBS measured by improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-m) score (p= 0. 030). This association was stronger for the non-progressive patients (p= 0. 006). INTERPRETATION: Pallidal firing rates and patterns differ significantly with dystonia aetiology and phenotype.

Fluorescence imaging <b>guided</b> <b>electrode</b> placement and pacing of the inferior and superior approaches to the AV node.

Electroencephalography (EEG) -functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography are helpful in <b>guiding</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation and surgical treatment, and high-frequency oscillations help defining {{the extent of the}} epileptogenic dysplasia. Ultra high-field MRI has a role in understanding the laminar organization of the cortex, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is highly sensitive for detecting FCD in MRI-negative cases. Multimodal imaging is clinically valuable, either by improving the rate of postoperative seizure freedom or by reducing postoperative deficits. However, there is no level 1 evidence that it improves outcomes. Proof for a specific effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in FCD is lacking. Pathogenic mutations recently described in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes in FCD have yielded important insights into novel treatment options with mTOR inhibitors, which might represent an example of personalized treatment of epilepsy based on the known mechanisms of disease. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in children with epilepsy caused by structural abnormalities, especially FCD. It attenuates epigenetic chromatin modifications, a master regulator for gene expression and functional adaptation of the cell, thereby modifying disease progression. This could imply lasting benefit of dietary manipulation. Neurostimulation techniques have produced variable clinical outcomes in FCD.

40|$|International audienceElectric chronic {{stimulation}} of the human motor cortex (ECSM) {{has been reported to}} alleviate chronic severe pain. However the mechanism of action of ECSM is still hypothetical. This is due mainly to the poor knowledge of, 1) the electric diffusion through the multiple structures beneath the epidural contacts (i. e. dura matter, cerebrospinal fluid space, arachnoid membrane, grey and white matter layers, pie mere and vascular tree), 2) the absence of consensus concerning the stimulation parameters (mono versus bipo-lar stimulation, cathodic or anodic current) and 3) the detailed cortical topography of the contacts. In this study we focused on the precise identification of the cortical areas covered by the electric contacts in a series of twelve patients operated on for ECSM. We propose a new automatic tool for topographic analysis able to compute 2 D maps from the 3 D anatomic MRI with bijective transformation (point-to-point correspondance). Anatomical regions of interest (AROIs) were visually identified, manually outlined and extracted (Iplan, BrainLab, Germany) for further analysis: 1) for the anatomic structures, on pre operative T 1 -weigthed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the frontal (superior or F 1, intermediate or F 2 and inferior or F 3), the pre central and the post central gyrus; 2) for the electrode contacts (Resume, Medtronic, USA), on post operative computerized tomography (CT). After getting white and gray matter membership maps by automatic segmentation, we produced a cortical mask to build a triangular mesh. We defined a homeomorphism between the 3 D mesh and a subset of R 2 and could apply in consequence the circle packing algorithm. We built depth maps (distance to the skull), distance-to-contact maps (distance to a given electrode contact) and anatomic structure maps. Results showed that it was easier to accurately define the location of the contact projection on the cortex allowing physicians to correlate the benefit with the topography. In particular, because of the unfolding, it was easier to integrate the cytoarchitectonics (i. e. the manually identified AROIs) knowledge in the analysis.

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is a widespread}} machining method for the die and mold industry. This method can machine all conductive materials, including hard-to-cut metals, because the machining process uses electro-thermal energy without a cutting force. During EDM, discharge sparks remove not only the material of a workpiece but also the material of an electrode. This machining mechanism thereby causes electrode wear, which creates serious problems, including make-shape errors and low productivity. In order to overcome such problems, a new EDM method using a strip electrode (strip EDM) was developed in this study. Strip EDM uses a continuously applied strip electrode similar to the wire electrode in wire EDM. In the suggested strip-electrode method, a conductive strip moves on the <b>electrode</b> <b>guide.</b> The worn strip is removed, and a new one is supplied continuously. Therefore, the tool electrode acquires no wear during the machining process. This method uses a conductive strip that is made of brass.

Polytetrafluoroethylene, resin (PTFE, Teflon®) <b>electrode</b> <b>guides</b> are built into the electrode housings to reduce friction with the spring-loaded electrode rods, which {{move in and out}} to conform to the body-surface. By applying pressure with metal springs, approximately the same electrode pressure can be achieved on the chest, side, and back. When a subject breathes during measurement, the contour of the body is physically altered. Since each spring-loaded electrode applies pressure independently, electrode lateral position shift is minimized and spring-loaded extension and retraction during breathing allows each electrode to follow body movement and maintain a consistent state of contact. Each electrode rod has a copper-zinc alloy hemispherical head that increases the contact area to reliably detect electric potential induced on the body-surface. Electrode diameter is 1.0  cm with a 35  mm spacing between center-points of adjacent electrodes. With this electrode design, manual thus time-consuming adhesive-attachment of individual electrodes in conventional body-surface electrocardiograph system is avoided, and since the electrodes are reusable, there is no waste of resources and no additional recurring costs.|$|R
40|$|Neurostimulation is an {{emerging}} treatment for refractory epilepsy. To date the precise {{mechanism of action}} remains to be elucidated. Better insight in the mechanism of action may identify seizure types or syndromes that respond to such a treatment and may guide the search for optimal stimulation parameters and finally improve clinical efficacy. In {{the past ten years}} some progress has been made through neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, neurochemical and cerebral blood flow studies in patients and animals undergoing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Interesting results have been found in VNS-treated patients that underwent evoked potential measurements, cerebrospinal fluid investigation, neuropsychological testing and PET, SPECT and fMRI testing. Desynchronisation of abnormal synchronous epileptic activity is one of the hypotheses on the mode of action that might primarily be responsible for an anti-seizure effect. There is however increasing evidence from research and clinical observation that VNS might establish a true and long-term anti-epileptic effect. It has been shown that VNS influences neurotransmission in the brain and provokes long-term changes in cerebral blood flow in areas crucial for epileptogenesis such as the thalamus and medial temporal lobe structures. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for epilepsy has regained interest. Central nervous system structures known to {{play a key role in}} the epileptogenic network such as the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus have been targeted. Another approach is to target the ictal onset zone such as the medial temporal lobe. At Ghent University Hospital 10 patients have been treated with long-term amygdalohippocampal DBS. Several hypotheses have been raised for the mechanism of action of DBS for refractory seizures. Seizure reduction may be due to a microlesion caused by electrode insertion or by provoking a reversible functional lesion due to the effect of electrical current on hyperexcitable tissue. Neurophysiological techniques such as evoked potentials monitoring and intraoperative single unit potential recordings may <b>guide</b> correct <b>electrode</b> placement, individual DBS titration and elucidation of the mechanims of action of DBS for epilepsy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This was an 84 -year-old male patient, with {{worsening}} {{functional class}} from NYHA III/IV to IV/IV and palpitations. No syncope. Physical examination revealed bradycardia, {{the rest was}} uneventful. Electrocardiogram showed Mobitz II atrioventricular block. Patient was scheduled for permanent pacemaker implantation. Subclavian vein access was performed via direct puncture. The guide wire was advanced, entered the subclavian vein and descended parallel to the spine without crossing over to the right side. Subsequently, the guide wire traversed the coronary sinus and ended in the right atrium. Persistent left superior vena cava was diagnosed. During fluoroscopic observation, another feature that aids in the diagnosis is left paravertebral shadow above the aortic bow. The electrode was initially introduced with a straight guide reaching into the right atrium (RA). Afterwards, the straight guide {{was replaced by a}} conventional J <b>guide</b> and the <b>electrode</b> was pushed towards the anterolateral wall of the RA. The electrode tip was thus lying against the tricuspid valve. Subsequently, the guide was withdrawn 3 cm. The guide withdrawal, without moving the electrode, is associated {{with the passage of the}} electrode through the tricuspid valve. The electrode was advanced and finally the active fixation mechanism was deployed 1. Author contributions Conception and design of the research, Acquisition o...|$|R
500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and <b>guided</b> by the <b>electrode</b> conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} on {{topics such as}} effective connectivity, neuronal coding strategy or signal propagation in the central nervous system requires simultaneous recordings from multiple sites within functionally grouped but topologically distributed neuronal clusters. We have addressed this issue by characterization of the cortical functional architecture using optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OI) and subsequent placement of multiple, individually adjustable electrodes into pre-selected domains. In order to achieve maximum precision and flexibility for the positioning of electrodes, a plastic cylinder containing channels of an extremely high aspect ratio (density > 20 channels/mm(2)) was fixed above the cortex and individual channel positions were superimposed onto the functional maps of orientation columns obtained previously with OI. Subsequently, channels corresponding to the desired locations in the functional map were used as <b>guide</b> tubes for <b>electrode</b> insertion. The spatial precision of this approach was in the range of 100 mum and experiments in cat primary visual cortex revealed a close correlation between the desired and the actually recorded orientation preferences of the targeted columns. The method is applicable to all cortical areas in which OI is feasible and offers a high degree of flexibility with respect to the number and geometry of applicable probes. It is, thus, an excellent tool for studying distributed codes and interactions between multiple predefined recording sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
