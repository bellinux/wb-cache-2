40|$|Recognizing {{differences}} in the physiology of fish is essential to understanding {{the problems associated with}} <b>drug</b> <b>approval</b> <b>for</b> the aquatic environment. A wide variety of experiments and the use of drugs in fish have been elucidated in various literatures. Antibacterial, antiparasitic and anaesthetic drugs, besides the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters have been well experimented on the fish. Several groups of drugs, such as tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, immunostimulants, anticancer agents, herbal drugs and vaccines, have been successfully experimented or used in fish. Hence, fish is also used as a new model organism for different experimental studies of pharmacology and toxicology. The potential for the application of research findings to both human and environmental health issues makes fish species attractive and valuable alternative models in various diseases, including cancer, and pharmacological and toxicological research.

In addition, rainbow trout are also reared for direct shipment to commercial markets. Until 2007, the U. S.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To evaluate, {{across a}} {{spectrum}} of diseases, how often surrogate outcomes are used as a basis <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> <b>approvals</b> by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and whether and how the rationale for using treatment effects on surrogates as predictors of treatment effects on patient-centred outcomes is discussed. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We used the Drugs@FDA website to identify <b>drug</b> <b>approvals</b> produced from 2003 to 2012 by the FDA. We focused on four diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 1 or 2 diabetes, glaucoma and osteoporosis) for which surrogates are commonly used in trials. We reviewed the drug labels and medical reviews to provide empirical evidence on how surrogate outcomes are handled by the FDA. RESULTS Of 1043 approvals screened, 58 (6 %) were for the four diseases of interest. Most drugs for COPD (7 / 9, 78 %), diabetes (26 / 26, 100 %) and glaucoma (9 / 9, 100 %) were approved based on surrogates while for osteoporosis, most drugs (10 / 14, 71 %) were also approved for patient-centred outcomes (fractures). The rationale for using surrogates was discussed in 11 of the 43 (26 %) <b>drug</b> <b>approvals</b> based on surrogates. In these <b>drug</b> <b>approvals,</b> we found <b>drug</b> <b>approvals</b> <b>for</b> diabetes {{are more likely than}} the other examined conditions to contain a discussion of trial evidence demonstrating that treatment effects on surrogate outcomes predict treatment effects on patient-centred outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the FDA did not use a consistent approach to address surrogates in assessing the benefits and harms of drugs for COPD, type 1 or 2 diabetes, glaucoma and osteoporosis. For evaluating new drugs, patient-centred outcomes should be chosen whenever possible. If the use of surrogate outcomes is necessary, then a consistent approach is important to review the evidence for surrogacy and consider surrogate's usage in the treatment and population under study...|$|R
