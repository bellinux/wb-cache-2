5000|$|As the 1974-75 {{dry season}} opened, the already hard-pressed MNK saw its {{effectiveness}} being immediately curtailed by the Khmer Rouge's extensive mine-laying {{campaign on the}} Bassac and Mekong rivers, intended at blocking {{the passage of the}} supply convoys that allowed the beleaguered Khmer Republic to receive much-needed ammunition, fuel and non-lethal aid (including food and medical supplies) transported upriver from South Vietnam to Phnom Penh.Chinese-made naval floating mines had been employed early in the war by the North Vietnamese against both military and civilian commercial shipping along the Mekong River, but never at such a scale. Although the MNK did possessed minesweeping capabilities, its five river MSR/MSM Minesweepers lacked the proper equipment that would allow their crews to carry out the task successfully. In addition, the insurgents' control of the riverbanks rendered any mine-sweeping operations virtually impossible or, at best extremely costly. On 18 January 1975, the MNK riverine forces and the Marines conducted their last <b>joint</b> <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> - codenamed Operation [...] "Sailor" [...] -, in an effort to clear Khmer Rouge units from some strategic islands in the Mekong close to Phnom Penh. [...] By 17 February, the MNK Fleet Command was forced to abandon any attempts to re-open the lower Mekong and Bassac corridors and all convoy escort operations were suspended.|$|E

During June and July, York County {{received}} alterations at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. On 13 August, the ship lifted the 3rd Marine Light Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion to Vieques and reembarked the unit on 17 September for the return passage. Ten days later, she returned to Little Creek and commenced preparations for an overseas exercise. On 7 October 1964, York County got underway to join in Operation [...] "Steel Pike I," [...] the largest <b>joint</b> <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> held since World War II. The ship returned home on 28 November 1964 and operated locally into the following spring. On 30 April 1965, York County sailed for the Dominican Republic and transported marines and equipment to Bajos de Haina. She conducted surveillance duties during the crisis in that nation before returning to Norfolk on 7 June and remaining in the Virginia Capes-Hampton Roads area for most of the summer. From September until December 1965, York County was deployed to the Caribbean and participated in numerous amphibious assault exercises and a major fleet exercise, [...] "Phibaswex/Meblex 2-65." ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Unmanned Ground Vehicle/System Joint Project Office is currently developing {{a family of}} untanned ground systems that may {{have the potential to}} give the ground combat commander the ability to gain a decisive advantage in the battle for information dominance. By harnessing the power of robotics in a reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition role, the UGV is designed to provide the maneuver battalion commander with the ability to extend his influence beyond the capabilities of traditional scouts. This thesis examined the Unmanned Ground Vehicle Medium (UGVM) using the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) model to evaluate the impact of changes to performance characteristics of the system. The scenario used for the simulation was based on Exercise KERNEL BLITZ (KB), a biennial <b>joint</b> <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> conducted on the West Coast of the United States. The UGVM's communication limitations and speed were varied in the JCATS simulations. Measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for these changes included total blue detections, blue detections over time, total blue kills, and blue losses over time. [URL] United States Marine Corps...|$|E

40|$|The current historiography of the Mexican War {{does not}} give due credit to the {{significance}} of the landing at Collado Beach. No one source addresses all aspects of the landing, nor have any included an analysis of the logistical side of the operation. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of the operation from conception to execution in an attempt to fill the gap in the historiography. Additionally, the lessons learned and lessons forgotten from this landing are addressed as to how this landing shaped American military doctrine regarding <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> and <b>amphibious</b> <b>operations.</b> The conclusion drawn from the historical sources supports the argument that this operation {{had a significant impact on}} the American military. The influence of this operation shows itself throughout American military history, including the establishment of amphibious doctrine by the Unites States Marine Corps and during World War II...|$|R
40|$|For a {{while now}} defence {{officials}} and analysts {{on both sides of}} the Tasman have been looking for ways to re-energise the Australia-New Zealand relationship. It’s almost as if the two neighbours were becoming too comfortable with where things between them were at. Finding concrete measures hasn’t proven easy so far but some cause for optimism might be on the horizon; cooperation on <b>amphibious</b> <b>operations</b> could breathe new life into ANZAC links. But to do so, some obstacles will need to be cleared out of the way. The development of an amphibious capability is one of key themes of Australia’s new Defence White Paper (DWP). With the arrival of the LHDs, the ambition is to maintain ‘an enduring <b>joint</b> <b>amphibious</b> presence in the South Pacific’. For its part, New Zealand is prioritising the development of a <b>Joint</b> <b>Amphibious</b> Task Force by 2015. Wellington’s 2011 Defence Capability Plan tells us that the Task Force will be designed primarily for ‘responding to security tasks and defence tasks in New Zealand and its environs, security challenges to New Zealand’s interests in the South Pacific, and challenges to New Zealand and Australia’s common security concerns’.

50|$|During the Mexican-American War the U.S. Navy {{blockaded}} Mexican ports, capturing or {{burning the}} Mexican fleet in the Gulf of California and capturing all major cities in Baja California peninsula. In 1846-1848 the Navy successfully used the Pacific Squadron under Commodore Robert Stockton and its marines and blue-jackets {{to facilitate the}} capture of California with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the California Battalion. The Navy conducted the U.S. military's first large-scale <b>amphibious</b> <b>joint</b> <b>operation</b> by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at Veracruz, Mexico. When larger guns were needed to bombard Veracruz, Navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city. This successful landing and capture of Veracruz {{opened the way for}} the capture of Mexico City {{and the end of the}} war. The U.S. Navy established itself as a player in United States foreign policy through the actions of Commodore Matthew Perry in Japan, which resulted in the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854.|$|R
