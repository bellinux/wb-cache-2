Ponting's arm was so badly damaged {{that it had to be}} pinned. Told to endure a 14-week lay-off, he never played competitive football again. He later wrote: [...] "At one stage I was concerned that the arm injury might also stop me from playing cricket but they [...] did a pretty <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>on</b> pinning the bones—and it hasn't bothered me since." ...|$|E

The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who {{would go on to}} provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time.

I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>on</b> the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory.

Praising the directors' decision to [...] " [...] big-name stars {{in favor of}} lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as [...] "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi [...] "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that [...] "the cast's names are less than household stature". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as [...] "terrific". ABC Online appreciated the fact that [...] "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, [...] "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do a really <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>on</b> the voices". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi [...] "creates {{a significant amount of}} range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn [...] "one the better [...] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's [...] "quick-tongued delivery", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor [...] "does a nice job" [...] as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore [...] "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as [...] "excellent as the rogueish hero". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi [...] "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that [...] "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest". Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as [...] "impressive".|$|E

They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of Darkman. After filming Darkman, they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan [...] "has {{a good sense of}} character" [...] and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, [...] "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.|$|E

30|$|The methods {{implemented}} {{in this study}} do not prove {{whether or not the}} environmental policies of South Korea are doing a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> based <b>on</b> the classical inferential statistics, nor do they provide truly marketable values of ecological resources because there is no specific market to trade ecological resources with the “invisible-hands”.

It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.'
