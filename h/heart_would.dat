5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the <b>Heart</b> <b>would</b> reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

25|$|HR = 1,500/RR {{interval}} in millimeters, HR = 60/RR interval in seconds, or HR = 300/number {{of large}} squares between successive R waves.

However, because the above formula is almost always mentioned, students determine HR this way without looking at the ECG any further.|$|E

Sonic's friends gather the emeralds and Tikal appears, demanding that Chaos be sealed {{back in the}} Master Emerald.

Chaos discovers the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling its anger. Tikal and Chaos disappear before Sonic chases a fleeing Eggman.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} chapter, Harvey {{estimated}} {{the capacity of}} the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. From these estimations, he demonstrated that according to Gaelen's theory that blood was continually produced in the liver, the absurdly large figure of 540 pounds of blood would have to be produced every day. Having this simple mathematical proportion at hand – which would imply a seemingly impossible role for the liver – Harvey went on to demonstrate how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up.|$|E

500|$|Although Ireland {{was one of}} her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and {{in places}} {{virtually}} autonomous, Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. Her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England. In the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued scorched-earth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. During a revolt in Munster led by Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death. The poet and colonist Edmund Spenser wrote that the victims [...] "were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> have rued the same". Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, [...] "that rude and barbarous nation", be well treated; but she showed no remorse when force and bloodshed were deemed necessary.|$|E
500|$|Smetana's biographers {{describe}} him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted {{him to become a}} brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the [...] "Wagnerism" [...] in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although [...] on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was [...] "crying as though her <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> break".|$|E

500|$|If all the {{obstacles}} of the Duat could be negotiated, the deceased would be judged in the [...] "Weighing of the Heart" [...] ritual, depicted in Spell 125. The deceased {{was led by}} the god Anubis into the presence of Osiris. There, the dead person swore {{that he had not}} committed any sin from a list of 42 sins, reciting a text known as the [...] "Negative Confession". Then the dead person's heart was weighed on a pair of scales, against the goddess Maat, who embodied truth and justice. Maat was often represented by an ostrich feather, the hieroglyphic sign for her name. At this point, there was a risk that the deceased's <b>heart</b> <b>would</b> bear witness, owning up to sins committed in life; Spell 30B guarded against this eventuality. If the scales balanced, this meant the deceased had led a good life. Anubis would take them to Osiris and they would find their place in the afterlife, becoming maa-kheru, meaning [...] "vindicated" [...] or [...] "true of voice". If the heart was out of balance with Maat, then another fearsome beast called Ammit, the Devourer, stood ready to eat it and put the dead person's afterlife to an early and unpleasant end.|$|E
500|$|In its year end {{review of}} albums {{released}} in 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rebel Heart at number 45 noting: [...] "How {{did it take}} this long for Madonna to write herself a theme song titled 'Unapologetic Bitch'? No apologies offered or needed—Rebel Heart was the queen's finest album in a decade, picking up the disco-stick baton of her 2005 Confessions on a Dance Floor as Madonna voyages back into the groove and reflects on where she's been lately". It was also listed at number six on its ranking of the 20 Best Pop Albums of 2015. Similarly, in its year end review, Spin magazine listed the album at number 21 as Andrew Unterberger noted that: [...] "For most artists who spent whole decades defining the mainstream, titling an album Rebel <b>Heart</b> <b>would</b> seem misguided at best, but for Madonna, it's truer now than ever: A fifty-something refusing to bend to public demands about how she should age gracefully... is as big an act of defiance as you can stage in contemporary pop music". AllMusic called Rebel Heart {{as one of their}} Favorite Pop Albums of 2015, describing it as: [...] "Bold, messy, and life-affirming record that finds Madonna simultaneously looking forward and back".|$|E
500|$|The Heart is a {{human heart}} {{modified}} with technology and the supernatural, that helps the player to find collectible items in the levels, and [...] "plays a part related to informing [...] decisions about when to apply violence or not, making it a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." [...] The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or history of a character, and its own origins. The Heart was originally designed {{as a method of}} identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game, the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the <b>Heart</b> <b>would</b> result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.|$|E
