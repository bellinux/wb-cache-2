5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor Rathbone led {{the society}} as its {{secretary}} from 1897, especially in campaigning in the 1910 elections. Three campaign shops were opened around Liverpool, asking men to vote <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> who supported votes for women, especially Alexander Gordon Cameron. In 1911, Rathbone and Stewart-Brown {{set up a}} branch of the society to educate women who would soon get the vote. When the society disagreed with the NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.|$|E

He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> of the Nacionalista Party. After Magsaysay's election, he joined the government as {{special assistant to the}} Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs.|$|E

5|$|Prior to her holding elected office, Rivers led AMR Consulting, a {{political}} consulting firm which aided candidates in their elections for offices, {{as well as}} providing political consultation to corporate clients.

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{period for}} parties and candidates began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was {{split into two}} phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage dialogue between parties and their constituents, these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements <b>for</b> <b>candidates),</b> but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, {{the last}} day <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> to file, Bevin {{announced}} he would seek the Republican nomination for governor. During his announcement, he introduced his running mate, Jenean Hampton, a Tea Party activist who lost her bid to unseat State Representative Jody Richards the previous year. Bevin joined a field that included Commissioner of Agriculture James Comer, former Louisville Councilman Hal Heiner, and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott. The National Journal predicted that Bevin would draw support away from Comer, the early front-runner, who had been appealing to Tea Party groups and already secured Congressman Massie's endorsement. The crowded primary was also projected to damage the Republican nominee's chances in the general election, since Attorney General Jack Conway was the only major Democratic candidate, allowing him to conserve resources for the general election. McConnell allies also predicted that Bevin's refusal to endorse McConnell would hurt him with primary voters.|$|E

50|$|A {{plurality}} vote (in North America) {{or relative}} majority (in the United Kingdom) describes the circumstance when a candidate or proposition polls more votes than any other, {{but does not}} receive a majority.

5|$|Williams {{suggested}} that McKinley's campaign {{of education of}} the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions <b>for</b> <b>candidates,</b> were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard.|$|E
5|$|Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 (1991) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that {{confirmed}} the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due {{to the death of}} H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidates. John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> and delegated that power to political parties.|$|E
