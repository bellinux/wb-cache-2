5000|$|An <b>isochrone</b> map (<b>isochrone</b> plan, <b>isochrone</b> diagram) {{in science}} and urban {{planning}} is a map showing areas related to s between different points. An <b>isochrone</b> is defined as [...] "a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time". Such a map is sometimes termed simply an <b>isochrone.</b> In hydrology and transportation planning <b>isochrone</b> maps are commonly used to depict areas of equal travel time. The term is also used in cardiology {{as a tool to}} visually detect abnormalities using body surface distribution.|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a new set}} of <b>isochrones,</b> called the Y 2 <b>Isochrones,</b> that represent an update of the Revised Yale <b>Isochrones</b> (RYI), using improved opacities and equations of state. Helium diffusion and convective core overshoot have also been taken into consideration. This first set of <b>isochrones</b> is for the scaled solar mixture. A subsequent paper will consider the effects of α-element enhancement, believed to be relevant in many stellar systems. Two additionally significant features of these <b>isochrones</b> are that (1) the stellar models start their evolution from the pre-main sequence birthline instead of from the zero-age main sequence, and (2) the color transformation has been performed using both the latest table of Lejeune et al., and 1 Current address the older, but now modified, Green et al. table.

40|$|The Yale stellar {{evolution}} code {{has been}} modified {{to use the}} OPAL equation of state tables (Rogers 1994). Stellar models and <b>isochrones</b> were constructed for low metallicity systems (- 2. 8 < [Fe/H] < - 0. 6). Above M∼ 0. 7, the <b>isochrones</b> {{are very similar to}} those which are constructed using an equation of state which includes the analytical Debye-Huckel correction at high temperatures. The absolute magnitude of the main sequence turn-off () with the OPAL or Debye-Huckel <b>isochrones</b> is about 0. 06 magnitudes fainter, at a given age, than derived from <b>isochrones</b> which do not include the Debye-Huckel correction. As a consequence, globular clusters ages derived using are reduced by 6 [...] 7 % as compared to the ages determined from the standard <b>isochrones.</b> Below M∼ 0. 7, the OPAL <b>isochrones</b> are systematically hotter (by approximately 0. 04 in B-V) at a given magnitude as compared to the standard, or Debye-Huckel <b>isochrones.</b> However, the lower mass models fall out of the OPAL table range, and this could be the cause of the differences in the location of the lower main-sequences.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{determined}} {{the age of}} a sample of nearby main-sequence stars with spectral types B 9 –K 9. We have derived the stellar ages from five different age estimators: the location in the HR diagram compared to theoretical <b>isochrones,</b> the rotational velocity, the strength of chromospheric calcium emission lines, the stellar metallicity, and their space velocity. New calibrations consistent with recent theoretical <b>isochrones</b> are provided {{for the last four}} indicators. For hot stars, <b>isochrones</b> are the best indicator, while stellar rotation is best for cool stars. However, many stars require in fact a combination of different methods to properly bracket their actual age. We also discuss the uncertainties involved, in particular those in using <b>isochrones,</b> and we find that these uncertainties are often underestimated in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Reliable temperature-colour transformations are a {{necessary}} ingredient for <b>isochrones</b> {{to be compared}} with observed colour-magnitude-diagrams of globular clusters. We show that both theoretical and empirical published transformations to (V-I) to a large extend exhibit significant differences between them. Based on these comparisons we argue for particular transformations for dwarfs and giants to be preferred. We then show that our selected combination of transformations results in fits of V-(V-I) -CMDs of a quality which is {{comparable to that of}} our earlier V-(B-V) <b>isochrones</b> {{for a wide range of}} cluster metallicities. The cluster parameters, such as reddening, are consistent with those derived in (B-V). Therefore, at least in the case of the fit with our own <b>isochrones</b> - based on the particular distance scale provided by our own horizontal branch models, and on the treatment of convection by the mixing-length theory having l/H_p calibrated on our solar model - the chosen transformations appear to lead to self-consistent (V-I) <b>isochrones.</b> Our <b>isochrones</b> are now well tested and self-consistent for B, V and I photometric data.

40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{important}} contributions of red giants to the integrated light in evolutionary synthesis calculations of old stellar populations in clusters and galaxies, we provide a comparison of theoretical <b>isochrones</b> computed from the Padova, Geneva, and Yale evolutionary tracks, respectively. Using the most recent version of the colorcalibrated library of theoretical stellar spectra by Lejeune et al. (1999), the <b>isochrones</b> are converted {{in a uniform manner}} to the observational color-magnitude diagrams, (M(T 1), C −T 1) and (M(I), V −I), and compared with observed giant branches of typical globular clusters spanning a large range of metallicities. We find that the three different <b>isochrones</b> of the red giant branch provide significantly different slopes and curvatures, where in general, the differences tend to be larger for metallicities decreasing below [M/H] ∼ − 1. Throughout the full metallicity range (− 2 < ∼ [M/H] < ∼ 0), the Yale <b>isochrones</b> are the only ones which show very good matches of both the observed giant branches and the associated metallicity scale derived from the color of the RGB, while the Padova <b>isochrones</b> exhibit significant discrepancies for low-metallicities. The effects of these differences on the integrated model colors of single stellar populations, in particular for age and metallicity determinations, are briefly addressed. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Isochrone</b> maps {{have been}} used in {{transportation}} planning since 1887 or earlier. Early examples of <b>Isochrone</b> maps include the Galton´s Isochronic Postal Charts and Isochronic Passage Charts of 1881 and 1882, Bartholomew's Isochronic Distance Map and Chart first published 1889 or earlier and Albrecht Penck's Isochronenkarte first published 1887. Where as Galton and the Bartholomews published maps depicting the days or weeks it took to travel long distances, Albrecht further developed the idea to not only depict long distances and world travel but also smaller areas. Penck also created a series of maps that only depict the travel times of a certain transportation mode, for example Rail transport. <b>Isochrone</b> maps are commonly used in the UK in connection with development control.

40|$|We have {{calculated}} theoretical <b>isochrones</b> for the photometric Delta {{a system}} to derive astrophysical parameters such as the age, reddening and distance modulus for open clusters. The Delta a system samples the flux depression at 520 nm which is highly efficient to detect chemically peculiar (CP) objects of the upper main sequence. The evolutionary status of CP stars is still {{a matter of debate}} and very important to test, for example, the dynamo and diffusion theories. In fact, the dynamo or fossil origin of the magnetic fields present in this kind of stars it still not clear. Using the stellar evolutionary models by Claret (1995), a grid of <b>isochrones</b> with different initial chemical compositions for the Delta a system was generated. The published data of 23 open clusters were used to fit these <b>isochrones</b> with astrophysical parameters (age, reddening and distance modulus) from the literature. As an additional test, <b>isochrones</b> with the same parameters for Johnson UBV data of these open clusters were also considered. The fits show a good agreement between the observations and the theoretical grid. We find that the accuracy of fitting <b>isochrones</b> to Delta a data without the knowledge of the cluster parameters is between 5 and 15 %. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted by A&...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend our}} {{theoretical}} computations for low-mass stars to intermediate-mass and massive stars, for which few databases {{exist in the}} literature. Evolutionary tracks and <b>isochrones</b> are computed for initial masses 2. 50 - 20 ~Msun for a grid of 37 chemical compositions with metal content Z between 0. 0001 and 0. 070 and helium content Y between 0. 23 and 0. 40 to enable users to obtain <b>isochrones</b> for ages as young as about 107 years and to simulate stellar populations with different helium-to-metal enrichment laws. The Padova stellar evolution code is identical to that used in the first paper of this series. Synthetic TP-AGB models allow stellar tracks and <b>isochrones</b> to be extended {{until the end of}} the thermal pulses along the AGB. We provide software tools for the bidimensional interpolation (in Y and Z) of the <b>isochrones</b> from very old ages down to about 107 years. This lower limit depends on chemical composition. The extension of the blue loops and the instability strip of Cepheid stars are compared and the Cepheid mass-discrepancy is discussed. The location of red supergiants in the H-R diagram is in good agreement with the evolutionary tracks for masses from 10 to 20 ~Msun.
