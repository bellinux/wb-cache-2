25|$|Decisions can be complex {{admixtures}} {{of facts}} and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted {{in the exercise of}} authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell, he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”. A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.|$|E

25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E

2500|$|The science {{revolution}} {{attributed to}} Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered {{a warning to}} the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the sophists, by dramatizing {{a situation in which}} humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, {{the fact that they have}} been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares [...] "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random.

2500|$|Recognition {{of group}} {{activities}} is {{fundamentally different from}} single, or multi-user activity recognition in that the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{the behavior of the}} group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it. [...] Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different then the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior. [...] The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic [...] and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel. [...] Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds. [...] Group activity recognition has applications for crowd management and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and Quantified Self applications.|$|E
