5|$|Although all {{the colossal}} <b>heads</b> are broadly similar, there are {{distinct}} stylistic {{differences in their}} execution. One of the <b>heads</b> from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the <b>heads</b> were originally brightly decorated. <b>Heads</b> did not just represent individual Olmec rulers; they also incorporated {{the very concept of}} rulership itself.|$|E

5|$|The colossal <b>heads</b> {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. However, the San Lorenzo <b>heads</b> were buried by 900BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The <b>heads</b> from Tres Zapotes {{had been moved}} from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the <b>heads</b> from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. The period of production of the colossal <b>heads</b> is therefore unknown, as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span during which colossal <b>heads</b> were produced vary from 50 to 200 years. The San Lorenzo <b>heads</b> {{are believed to be}} the oldest, and are the most skillfully executed. All of the stone <b>heads</b> have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic (1500–1000BC), although the two Tres Zapotes <b>heads</b> and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC).|$|E
