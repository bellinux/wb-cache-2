40|$|This work {{presents}} an investigation on a flow phenomenon marked by <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocity</b> non-uniformity {{associated with a}} ported shroud turbocharger compressor observed upstream of the compressor inlet at lower operating speeds. The effect of structural struts in the ported shroud (PS) cavity {{and the location of}} the volute tongue on velocity non-uniformity is studied in this paper by numerically modelling the complete compressor stage using a (Un) steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS & URANS) approach. The results show that the amplitude of <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocity</b> non-uniformity is reduced by removing the struts from the PS cavity. Furthermore, the change in location of the volute tongue is shown to either substantially diminish or enhance the amplitude of velocity non-uniformity based on the relative position of the volute tongue and the struts.

From the variations of the <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocity</b> with the Galactocentric radius for the young and old red clump stars, {{we are able to}} identify two types of peculiar velocities: 1) both the two red clump populations show that the radial velocity is negative within R= 9. 0 kpc and becomes positive beyond (denoted as the long-wave mode); and 2) the young red clump stars show larger mean radial velocity than the old population by about 3 km s^- 1 between R= 9 and 12 kpc (denoted as the short-wave mode). We find that the elliptical disk induced by the rotating bar can well explain the long-wave mode peculiar velocity. The axis ratio of the elliptical disk is around 0. 8 - 0. 95 and the disk keeps circular at R= 9. 24 ± 0. 2 kpc, which should be the location of the outer Lindblad resonance radius (OLR). Adopting the circular speed of 238 km s^- 1, the pattern speed of the bar is then derived as 48 ± 3 km s^- 1 kpc^- 1 from the location of OLR. On the other hand, the short-wave mode is likely the perturbation of the spiral arms as density waves. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, Submitted to Ap...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} power {{spectral}} analysis of Spitzer {{images of the}} Large Magellanic Cloud. The power spectra of the FIR emission show two different power laws. At larger scales (kpc) the slope is ~ - 1. 6, while at smaller ones (tens to few hundreds of parsecs) the slope is steeper, with a value ~ - 2. 9. The break occurs at a scale around 100 - 200 pc. We interpret this break as the scale height of the dust disk of the LMC. We perform high resolution simulations with and without stellar feedback. Our AMR hydrodynamic simulations of model galaxies using the LMC mass and rotation curve, confirm that they have similar two-component power-laws for projected density and that the break does indeed occur at the disk thickness. Power spectral analysis of velocities betrays a single power law for in-plane components. The vertical component of the velocity shows a flat behavior for large structures and a power law similar to the <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocities</b> at small scales.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a string of}} vehicles where the local control law uses {{the states of the}} vehicle's immediate predecessor and follower. The coupling towards the preceding vehicle can be chosen different to the coupling towards the following vehicle, which {{is often referred to as}} an asymmetric bidirectional string. Further, the asymmetry for the <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> can be chosen differently to the asymmetry in the position coupling. It is investigated how the effect of disturbance on the control errors in the string depends on the string length. It is shown, that in case of symmetric position <b>coupling</b> and asymmetric <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling,</b> linear scaling can be achieved. For symmetric interaction in both states, i. e., in symmetric bidirectional strings, the errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in position is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even become unstable. The paper thus gives a comprehensive overview of the achievable performance in linear, asymmetric, bidirectional platoons. The results reveal that symmetry in the position coupling and asymmetry in <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> qualitatively improves the performance of the string. Extensive numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings. Comment: submitted, 10 page...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{physical}} {{measurements of the}} sound radiated by stringed musical instruments. The radiation efficiency, defined as the ratio of acoustical power output to mechanical power input, was measured to study the acoustical behaviour of the instruments between 80 Hz and 2000 Hz. The research used spherical-harmonic decomposition to determine the power output from monopole and dipole sources. On classical guitars, monopole power produced by the low-frequency resonance triplet provided the greatest contribution to the power output below 300 Hz. At higher frequencies, where the body modes have more complex shapes, dipole sources dominated the total power output. As the dipole contribution to the power output increases, the radiation efficiency of the instrument decreases. The research demonstrated that the resonance frequencies of the body modes of the instruments do not correspond with either a large or small value of radiation efficiency. Instead it is the mode shape that determines the radiation efficiency. Modes with similar-sized anti-nodal areas, of opposite phase, {{were found to be}} less efficient than modes which had unequal-sized anti-nodal areas. Measurements of the <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocity</b> of these modes, made with a 3 D scanning laser vibrometer, showed that the less-efficient modes had greater values of <b>in-plane</b> <b>velocity.</b> The largest values of radiation efficiency for classical guitars occurred between 200 Hz and 600 Hz. The upper frequency limit of this range was determined by the resonance frequency of a particular mode. This was confirmed by experiments on a purpose-built guitar in which the cross-grain stiffness could be adjusted. Experiments on classical guitars, steel-string guitars and violins produced characteristically different radiation efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much dispute about {{triggering}} of non-linear combustion instability(CI). The norm has been to use ad hoc models to include second order combustion terms most notably <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling.</b> This term arose due to classical linear analyses predicting stable motors necessitating another driving function. However there is no practical universally accepted experimental method that can obtain the <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> response function. The solid rocket motor (SRM) designer is left to his own devices {{as to what the}} contribution of <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> may be. This has led to much confusion and rocket motors that have been predicted stable but in practice were not. Flandro and co workers provide an alternative interpretation into the cause of non-linear combustion instability by including rotational terms into the linear analysis. This has been shown to improve the linear stability prediction by predicting unstable systems i. e. CI is always present but at low amplitudes growing too slowly to form a steep fronted wave. A pulse in this context needs to be of high enough amplitude to induce rapid growth. No criterion exists to predict such an amplitude. This study uses a newly developed analysis methodology using tubular grain SRMs to investigate both interpretations i. e. a linearly stable system with <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> or linearly unstable system. This method when combined with response data can be used to obtain a <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> response function from pulse tests. From this analysis it was possible to obtain reasonable <b>velocity</b> <b>coupling</b> response function. When using these constants to predict it was possible to predict a trigger point. Interestingly this point changes significantly with the initial higher order mode amplitudes. It then becomes vital to understand the likely wave structure of a pulse and what influence it has on the triggering amplitude. The system dynamics did not follow that of the experimental data but {{this may be due to}} truncation errors and assumptions made in the mathematical model. However the limiting amplitude is predicted correctly. The Flandro interpretation can be evaluated using this new method and applying a systematic study to evaluate criteria for the triggering amplitude. The linearly unstable values seem to capture the system dynamics better. However, in theory any pulse should cause CI. Regardless whether it is true or perceived triggering there seems to be an amplitude value at which non-linear CI is induced. The boundary layer pumping term here seems to be the key to interpreting triggering. The boundary layer acts as a piston that drives the acoustic oscillations when in phase. Thus for non-linear CI to occur the pulse must be of such an amplitude to cause the boundary layer to oscillate and maintain a high enough amplitude until the boundary layer starts to oscillate in phase. Regardless of interpretation this method shows great promise in allowing SRM designers to obtain quantitative response data and investigate triggering quickly and cheaply.
