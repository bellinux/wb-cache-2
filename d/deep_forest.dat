5|$|The bobcat is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the <b>deep</b> <b>forest.</b> It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{this project}} of Éric Mouquet, a member of <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest,</b> and Guilain Joncheray is to treat Breton music {{in the same way}} that <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest</b> treated African music, with {{traditional}} lyrics and electronic accompaniments. Michel Sanchez, the other member of <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest,</b> also worked on the album, recorded and mixed by Erwin Autrique. Breton singers Arnaud Maisonneuve and Manu Lann Huel also appear on the album, as well as Tri Yann. It is Prigent's first experience combining Breton lyrics and electronic music.|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{describes}} the Suebi as pressing the German tribes of the Rhine, {{such as the}} Tencteri, Usipetes and Ubii, from the east, forcing them from their homes. While emphasizing their warlike nature he writes {{as if they had}} a settled homeland somewhere between the Cherusci and the Ubii, and separated from the Cherusci by a <b>deep</b> <b>forest</b> called the Silva Bacenis. He also {{describes the}} Marcomanni as a tribe distinct from the Suebi, and also active within the same alliance. But he does not describe where they were living.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} album {{version and}} subsequent radio edit {{of the song}} had a much slower tempo than the more well-known remixes and was essentially structured like a pop song, with the characteristic synthetic instrumentation of the more melodic side of ambient music — though including darker overtones, such as the prominently featured Gregorian chant (Gloria in Excelsis Deo). This last element often invites comparison to popular ambient/new age/world music projects of the 1990s like Enigma and <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest</b> who routinely sample chants from various ethnicities worldwide, though in contrast such vocals featured on Karma were all original recordings.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian group Muzsikás played {{numerous}} American {{tours and}} participated in the Hollywood movie The English Patient while the singer Márta Sebestyén worked with the band <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest.</b> The Hungarian táncház movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs. However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania. The táncház movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created {{a new kind of}} music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities elsewhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The next leg of {{the journey}} takes the prince into a <b>deep</b> <b>forest</b> {{inhabited}} by the evil Spânul, or Bald Man. There follow three consecutive encounters between the protagonist and the Bald Man: after twice refusing the latter's insidious offer of services, the prince is eventually forced by dire circumstance into accepting it. After another elaborate deception, the creature is able to trap the prince into a well, and only leaves him out in exchange for swearing on his backsword that they would exchange roles: the Bald Man will be introduced as the king's son to his uncle, while the young man will become a slave {{under the name of}} Harap Alb. They proceed to the Green Emperor's palace, who innocently welcomes the Bald Man as his son. During the meeting, the master makes a point of mistreating and hitting his slave. This upsets the emperor's daughter, who asks him to behave with more reserve, and secretly begins to wonder about his actual identity.|$|E

The inside of the cottage includes obstacles such as trapdoors the player can fall through and robbers who can steal the player's valuables, while the cottage's surroundings include [...] "mysterious creatures" [...] that the player can encounter.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1941, the Brown County Game Preserve and Brown County State Park were unified as {{a single}} state park. Since that time, two {{portions}} of the park have been designated as nature preserves—giving them additional protection from development. [...] Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve was established in 1970 and consists of [...] in Ogle Hollow containing the rare yellowwood tree. [...] The second preserve is the [...] Ten O'Clock Line Nature Preserve. [...] This preserve was designated in 2010, and is Indiana's largest. [...] It also contains yellowwood trees, and {{is the home of}} some of Indiana's <b>deep</b> <b>forest</b> species, including the red bat, timber rattlesnake, and broad-winged hawk.

500|$|During this period, Anggun {{also did}} {{a string of}} collaborations, soundtrack projects, and charity albums.

Among her charity projects were Solidays in 2000 (featuring her collaboration with Peter Gabriel and several international acts), Les voix de l'espoir in 2001, and Gaia in 2002 (featuring a duet with Zucchero on the song [...] "World"). Anggun also collaborated with Bryan Adams in writing a song entitled [...] "Walking Away" [...] which remains unreleased for unknown reason.|$|E
500|$|International {{music was}} chosen as the primary music style of Strange Days due to its variety of sounds and instruments. According to music {{supervisor}} Randy Gerston, who previously worked on True Lies, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that [...] "the world is shrinking and people are getting acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular." [...] Musicians featured on the soundtrack also included French duo <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest,</b> British trip hop artist Tricky, and British alternative rock band Skunk Anansie. The latter was encouraged to jam between takes at the film's New Year event so that Bigelow could record them live and give the rave a greater authenticity. Although the band would have a live sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync. A soundtrack album was released shortly before the film's opening. In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, was made available only through the [...] "College Special" [...] issue of Rolling Stone magazine that was sold at record stores.|$|E

John Lennon's work [...] "Imagine" [...] owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track [...] "The Inner Light" [...] sets to Indian raga music a verse from the Tao Te Ching that [...] "without going out of your door you can know the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie The Mission the guilty {{conscience and}} penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone ("On Earth {{as it is in}} Heaven") The song Sweet Lullaby by <b>Deep</b> <b>Forest</b> is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called [...] "Rorogwela" [...] in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother.
