5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clause</b> of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three.

The constitutional analysis of Part II begins with a discussion of Takings Clause issues presented by the former 2 ̆ 2 appropriation 2 ̆ 2 approach.

Part II then examines the criminal law protections embodied in the Excessive Fines and Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clauses</b> and evoked by the latter 2 ̆ 2 civil penalty 2 ̆ 2 approach. Next, Part III argues for specific statutory adoption of the civil penalty approach and discusses the practice and policy issues that that approach presents.

40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} how the multiple-punishment {{prohibition}} of section 654 applies to the enhancements of one particular California statute: the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention (2 ̆ 2 STEP 2 ̆ 2) Act, a piece of anti-gang legislation passed in 1988 {{in the wake of}} rampant gang-related violence in the Los Angeles area. Specifically, this discussion centers on the imposition of multiple gang-enhancement provisions on a single defendant who engages in a single crime spree. If section 654 does apply to gang enhancements, then the prosecutorial practice of attaching them to every criminal charge in an indictment violates the intent of this Penal Code section, an intent rooted in the Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>clauses</b> of both the California and United States Constitutions. The question potentially affects thousands of inmates who are now serving additional pnson time because of gang enhancements...|$|R

These decisions, and civil forfeiture schemes generally, have faced strong criticism from scholars and civil libertarians.

40|$|In 1996, the Supreme Court issued two opinions, Bennis v. Michigan and United States v. Ursery, {{emphasizing}} {{the constitutionality of}} civil forfeiture schemes under both the Due Process and Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clauses</b> of the Fifth Amendment. These decisions, and civil forfeiture schemes generally, have faced strong criticism from scholars and civil libertarians.

Those opposed to today 2 ̆ 7 s forfeiture laws have seized upon this history to demonstrate the supposedly senseless origins of forfeiture. The Supreme Court also has invoked the history of civil forfeiture, but for a different purpose. Although the Court has sometimes acknowledged that the fiction underlying civil forfeiture may seem unfair, it has nevertheless upheld forfeiture schemes based on the historical prevalence and acceptance of the practice. Thus, while both the critics and the Court have used the history of forfeiture actions to support their conclusions, neither side has made any serious attempt to understand this history. This Article closely examines the widespread historical practice of conducting legal actions against both inanimate objects and animals. It is unsatisfying simply to conclude that these trials were the product of irrationality or superstitiousness. Instead, this Article speculates on whether these trials may have performed important social functions for the community. In particular, the trials may have permitted the community to heal itself after the breach of a social norm by creating a narrative whereby a symbolic transgressor of the established order was deemed to be 2 ̆ 2 guilty 2 ̆ 2 of a 2 ̆ 2 crime 2 ̆ 2 and cast beyond the boundaries of the society. This Article then suggests that at least some aspects of modern civil forfeiture law may fulfill a similar function. Still today, a forfeiture proceeding can serve to remove an offensive symbol of wrongdoing from the community, a function that is quite distinct from the desire to punish the culpable individual who may have used the object. Indeed, the importance of this symbolic aspect of civil forfeiture may provide a way of thinking about the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent jurisprudence in this area...|$|R

Justice McLean dissented in both cases on constitutional grounds. The Court was not called on to consider a case in which dual prosecution had actually occurred.|$|E
25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will run afoul of the double <b>jeopardy</b> <b>clause</b> if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a probationer of the court as a whole, and not that of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a probationer, to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not reviewable on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to abuse of discretion.|$|E

500|$|In three opinions, the Marshall Court {{considered}} {{questions of}} double jeopardy, without ever clearly {{referring to the}} Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clause</b> of the Fifth Amendment. First, in United States v. Perez (1824), the Court held {{that there was no}} bar to a second prosecution after a mistrial was declared for [...] "manifest necessity." [...] (Justice Story authored the opinion of the Court, espousing the position taken by Justice Thompson below.) Next, in United States v. Wilson (1833), the Court held that the protection of prior jeopardy extended to lesser included offenses; [...] "fter the judgment , no subsequent prosecution could be maintained for the same offence, nor for any part of it." [...] But, Wilson held that, in order to receive the protection of a pardon, a defendant must accept the pardon and affirmatively plead its existence in court. And, finally, in United States v. Randenbush (1834)where the defendant had first been acquitted of counterfeiting one note, and then convicted of counterfeiting a different note (which had been introduced as evidence at the first trial)the Court held that double jeopardy did not run from the use of the same evidence for [...] "entirely a distinct offence." ...|$|E

[...] (Even if these charges could be considered similar, this would not violate the double <b>jeopardy</b> <b>clause</b> in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as prosecutions under state and federal laws are considered distinct prosecutions.) [...] Justice La Forest wrote for the majority, [...] "I do not think our constitutional standards can be imposed on other countries." [...] The majority found that the charge would be in accordance with [...] "traditional procedures" [...] in Ohio. [...] Finally, it found that [...] "It is interesting that, as we saw, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that successive prosecutions at the federal and state level do not automatically offend against the due process clause, the spirit and content of which bears some resemblance to s. 7 of the Charter, although the courts would act to prevent oppressive behaviour." ...|$|E
2500|$|After an eight-and-a-half-month trial the U.S. District Court of South Dakota (Fred Joseph Nichol, {{presiding}} judge) {{dismissed the}} charges against Banks and Means for conspiracy and assault (both Banks and Means were defended by William Kunstler and Mark Lane). The jury had voted 12-0 to acquit both defendants of the conspiracy charge, but before the second vote one juror suffered a stroke and could not continue deliberations. The government refused to accept a verdict of eleven jurors and sought a mistrial; [...] "n the meantime the defense team filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, thus giving this court the alternative of granting a mistrial or ruling on the motion." [...] The judge ruled to dismiss citing prosecutorial misconduct, {{the basis of the}} defense's move to acquit. [...] "Because I am ruling on the motion through use of the supervisory power and am not making an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence, a judgment of acquittal would be inappropriate. It is true that a judgment of dismissal is not the only possible remedy in this situation, i. e. a new trial could be ordered. It is my belief, however, that the misconduct by the government in this case is so aggravated that a dismissal must be entered in the interests of justice." [...] In 1975 the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government's appeal was barred by the Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clause</b> and dismissed it, [...] "despite Government's argument that jurisdiction should be assumed due to the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turning to {{the second}} issue {{regarding}} the constitutional limits of increased sentences upon reconviction, the Court found that neither the Double <b>Jeopardy</b> <b>Clause</b> of the Fifth Amendment nor the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes a trial judge from increasing a sentence upon reconviction. [...] Since a trial judge is not “constitutionally precluded…from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence,” the trial court is free to consider issues that have emerged after the original trial that have “thrown new light upon the defendant's ‘life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.’” As a result, the Court did not impose “an absolute constitutional bar” to an increased sentence upon retrial, since these considerations may properly justify an increased sentence. [...] Nonetheless, the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes limits on the trial judge’s ability to increase sentences. [...] The Court reasoned {{that it would be}} a “flagrant violation” of due process for a state court to follow a policy of increasing sentences upon every reconvicted defendant, and it would be a violation of due process for trial courts to impose that type of punishment on defendants who successfully exercise their constitutional rights. The Court further extended this protection to a defendant who prevails on statutory (rather than constitutional) claims, to ensure that a defendant who exercises his right of appeal [...] "be free and unfettered.” Thus, vindictiveness, or choosing to punish a defendant who exercises his right to appeal, must not be considered when a judge imposes a new sentence.|$|E
