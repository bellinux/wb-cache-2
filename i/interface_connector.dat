50|$|Reverse-polarity BNC (RP-BNC) is a {{variation}} of the BNC specification which reverses the polarity of the <b>interface.</b> In a <b>connector</b> of this type, the female contact normally found in a jack is usually in the plug, while the male contact normally found in a plug is in the jack. This ensures that reverse polarity <b>interface</b> <b>connectors</b> do not mate with standard <b>interface</b> <b>connectors.</b> The SHV connector is a high-voltage BNC variant that uses this reverse polarity configuration.|$|R

Below the primary interface a test <b>interface</b> <b>connector</b> was available, {{making it possible to}} connect test equipment without having to disconnect the main downstream signal from the network. The frequency of the downstream signal was configurable via the management interface.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{version of}} that standard, called TIA-968-A, {{specifies}} the modular connectors at length, but not the wiring. Instead, TIA-968-A incorporates a standard called T1.TR5-1999, [...] "Network and Customer Installation <b>Interface</b> <b>Connector</b> Wiring Configuration Catalog", by reference to specify the wiring. With the publication of TIA-968-B, the connector descriptions have been moved to TIA-1096-A.

50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{upgrades}} became available. The PCW 8256's RAM could be expanded to 512 KB for a hardware cost of about £50. An additional internal floppy disk drive for the 8256 would cost about £100, and installation was fairly easy. Alternatively one could add external drives, for example if a 3½-inch drive was needed. Graphical user interface devices such as light pens, mice and graphic tablets could {{be attached to the}} expansion socket {{at the back of the}} monitor. Adding a serial <b>interface</b> <b>connector,</b> which cost about £50, made it possible to attach a modem or non-Amstrad printer.|$|E

50|$|The {{size and}} shape of any device is largely driven by the {{size and shape}} of the {{components}} used to make that device. Traditional HDDs and optical drives are designed around the rotating platter(s) or optical disc along with the spindle motor inside. If an SSD is made up of various interconnected integrated circuits (ICs) and an <b>interface</b> <b>connector,</b> then its shape is no longer limited to the shape of rotating media drives. Some solid state storage solutions come in a larger chassis that may even be a rack-mount form factor with numerous SSDs inside. They would all connect to a common bus inside the chassis and connect outside the box with a single connector.|$|E

40|$|Jigsaw patterns, a {{graphical}} architecture description notation, will {{be presented}} in this paper. The jigsaw patterns shows components and <b>connectors</b> with their <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Connectors</b> are structures or objects implementing the interfaces.

The semantics of the jigsaw patterns in terms of ML is also described. The application of this notation is illustrated by a case study " 3 D-Med" prototype system. The jigsaw patterns differs from other architecture description languages (ADLs) and supporting tools in that it focuses on the overall system structure, how subsystems interface and how they decompose further. Other ADLs and tools supports mainly the description and analysis of style-based components and their connections.

Hammond modified their <b>interface</b> <b>connectors</b> to be [...] "Leslie-proof", but Leslie quickly engineered a workaround. The Leslie company was sold to CBS in 1965 and was finally bought by Hammond in 1980. Hammond-Suzuki acquired the rights to Leslie in 1992; the company currently markets a variety of speakers under this name. As well as faithful reissues of the original 122 speaker, the company announced in 2013 that they would start manufacturing a standalone Leslie simulator in a stomp box.|$|R
