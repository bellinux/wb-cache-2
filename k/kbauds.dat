40|$|The {{transmission}} of digitally encoded speech at 1. 2 <b>Kbaud</b> for mobile personal communication networks (PCN) is investigated both analytically and by computer simulations. Speech was encoded at 4. 8 Kbit/s using a low complexity transform binary pulse excited LPC codec. A 64 -level QAM modem was used having 3 sub channels that operated with different BERs. The {{sensitivity of the}} encoded speech bits to transmission errors was identified, and the bits classified into 3 groups. Each group was then individually coded by BCH codec of differing power. The output of the BCH coders were grey coded onto 3 QAM channels. By this arrangement the protection given to the speech bits was dependent on their vulnerability. The 6 bit QAM symbols were transmitted at 1. 2 <b>Kbaud</b> over Rayleigh fading channels with pedestrian mobiles travelling upto 4 mile/h. For microcells using a propoagation frequency of 1. 9 GHz and operating with channel SNRs in excess 26 dB we achieved good communication quality speech when second-order diversity and AGC were used...|$|R

The template, {{based on the}} provisionally agreed template (T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 099), has been modified to better accommodate more "squared off" PSDs, like those of CAP and QAM, while tightening up other portions of the template to improve ADSL margins.

40|$|The {{image quality}} and {{compression}} ratio trade-offs of five different 176 × 144 pels quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) fractal image codes are investigated by simulation. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) ranges from 29 dB to 37 dB, while the coding rate from 0. 24 bit/pel (bpp) to 1. 22 bit/pel, {{as seen in}} Table 1. Two of the candidate codecs, a 0. 28 bit/pel and a 1. 1 bit/pel codec, were subjected to bit-sensitivity analysis and projected by the source-sensitivity matched shortened binary BCH(122, 80, 6) and BCH (122, 52, 11) codes and transmitted using coherent pilot symbol assisted (PSAM) square-constellation 16 -level quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM). The proposed fractal video communications required a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of about 15 dB {{in order to maintain}} a video peak SNR (PSNR) of 31 dB and 35 dB at signaling rate of 39 <b>kBaud</b> and 156 <b>kBaud,</b> respectively, over Rayleigh-fading channels having a propagation frequency of 1800 MHz and a pedestrian speed of 2 mph...|$|R

Overall MU/ABTS project {{objectives}} are to provide a biotelemetry system that can collect data from and send commands to an implanted biotransceiver. This system will provide for studies of rodent development in space. The system must be capable of operating in a metal animal cage environment. An important goal is the development of a small, "smart", micropower, -channel data output and single channel command implantable biotransceiver with eight input capabilities with the flexibility for easy customization for a variety of physiologic investigations. The NASA Ames/Marquette University Joint Research work has been devoted to the system design of such a new state of the art biotelemetry system, having multiple physiologic inputs, and bi-directional data transfer capabilities. This work has provided a successful prototype system that connects, by two-way radio links, an addressable biotelemetry system that provides communication between an animal biotelemeter prototype and a personal computer.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if the {{communication}} channel is bandlimited to W Hz one can transmit at most 2 W independent symbols per second. Generalized sampling theorems, nevertheless, do not restrict such a signaling to be uniform [1], [2], [3]. That is, it is theoretically possible to distribute the data symbols non-uniformly in time as long as the average signaling rate does not exceed 2 W. Since the average baud rate remains the same, non-uniform signaling techniques are rarely used in normal communication scenarios. Recently, based on the observation that almost all of the public telephone network is digital, it has been proposed that 56 kb/s transmission is theoretically possible over voice band channels [7]. The proposed signaling is a nonuniform one which makes it possible to receive independent data symbols using available 8 kHz PCM samplers while the average baud rate is kept limited to 7 <b>kbaud</b> (W= 3500 Hz).

40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{demonstrate}} a wireless communications system capable of simultaneous, high speed data communications {{from a variety of}} sensors. We have previously reported on the design and application of 2 KHz data logging transceiver nodes, however, only one node may stream data at a time, since all nodes on the network use the same communications frequency. To overcome these limitations, second generation data logging transceivers were developed with software programmable radio frequency (RF) communications. Each node contains on-board memory (2 Mbytes), sensor excitation, instrumentation amplifiers with programmable gains & offsets, multiplexer, 16 bit A/D converter, microcontroller, and frequency agile, bi-directional, frequency shift keyed (FSK) RF serial data link.

40|$|Software thread {{integration}} (STI) is {{a compilation}} technique which enables the {{efficient use of}} an application’s fine-grain idle time on generic processors without special hardware support. With STI, a primary function (with real-time requirements on specific instructions) is automatically interleaved with a secondary function to create a single implicitly multithreaded function which minimizes context switching and hence both improves performance and also offers very fine-grain concurrency. In this paper we extend STI techniques to address two challenges. First, we reduce response time for interrupts or other high-priority threads by introducing polling servers into integrated threads. Currently integrated threads disable interrupts, delaying all other work until their completion. Second, we enable integration with long host threads, expanding the domain of STI. With current techniques, if there are frequent interrupts, only host threads which can finish execution before the next interrupt can be integrated. We derive methods to evaluate the response time for threads in systems with and without these new integration methods. We demonstrate these concepts with the integration of various threads in a sample hard-real-time system on a highly-constrained microcontroller. We use an inexpensive 20 MHz AVR 8 -bit microcontroller to generate monochrome NTSC video while servicing a high-speed (115. 2 <b>kbaud)</b> serial communication link.

To overcome these limitations, 2 nd generation data logging transceivers were developed with software programmable radio frequency (RF) communications. Each node contains on-board memory (2 Mbytes), regulated sensor excitation, instrumentation amplifiers with programmable gains & offsets, multiplexer, 12 bit A/D converter, microcontroller, and frequency agile, bi-directional, frequency shift keyed (FSK) RF serial data link.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{system has}} been {{developed}} to simultaneously sample and transmit digital data from five remote geophysical data receiver stations to a control station that processes, displays, and stores the data. A microprocessor in each remote station receives commands from the control station over a single telemetry channel. The commands adjust the sensing amplifier’s input voltage range (1 microvolt to 2 volts peak-to-peak), the number of samples (128 to 30, 000), the sampling rate (256 to 32, 768 samples/sec), {{and the number of}} signals (1 to 16) to average at the remote stations. A 12 bit analog-to-digital converter samples data with bandwidths of 100 Hz to 10 kHz for time periods selected from 100 seconds to 1 second, respectively. Each remote station begins sampling geophysical signals when it receives a synchronizing pulse relayed from the control station. Digitized geophysical data is transmitted to the control station over broadband (100 kHz bandwidth) UHF telemetry channels using standard asynchronous serial (19. 2 <b>kbaud)</b> techniques and hardware dropout detection and recovery. The amount of data (480 kbits) and the maximum time to transmit data (30 secs) dictate using broadband telemetry (even though most geophysical telemetry is less than 10 kHz in bandwidth). Header information (transmitted before the data) contains station number, digital sampling parameters, transmission block size, and checksum. This information is used by a computer program (in a PDP- 11 / 23 (***) minicomputer) to maintain up to 5 simultaneous Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers from the remote stations into 5 separate data buffers. Filled buffers are transfered (via an IEEE- 488 bus) to an interactive analysis and display system (HP 9845 C (***)) for selecting data to be stored on magnetic media for subsequent laboratory analysis...|$|R

As Canada is expected to provide at least four alpha stations, and a significant number of beta stations, the financial resources that will be needed are substantial, even though in many respccts the GSC is, with the recent modernization of the Yellowknife array and the ongoing installation of the Canadian National Seismograph Network (CNSN), well positioned to make a significant contribution to GSETT 3. The CNSN currently (October 1993) consists of 17 broad band stations and will grow to 23 and 33 such stations by December 1993 and December 1994 respectively. Some 40 50 short period stations will complete the network. Data from all sites are continuously telemetered in real time to network acquisition centres in Ottawa and Sidney, British Columbia, archived to optical disk, and kept on line in a 72 h ring buffer. Most of the broadband sites could serve as either alpha or beta stations once the necessary software for continuous data transfer, or on request provision, of data from the selected sites has been completed. This software wili be configured so that changes in station selection are easy to implement, and this will provide considerable flexibility to the GSETT 3 planning and operations working groups in selecting the optimum network. Backup stations can be designated in the case of station failures, and the network centre in British Columbia will serve, at least for beta stations, as a backup NDC to that in Ottawa. Data from. the Yellowknife array are collected in Yellowknife and forwarded in ten minute files to Ottawa, where processing is completed and the results archived. This arrangement would not meet the deadlines for receipt of alpha station data at the IDC and new hardware and software will be needed to forward the data more immediately from Yellowknife to Ottawa. Although the procedures and formats for both alpha and beta station data have not yet been agreed upon, or even discussed, by the GSE, it is apparent that new facilities will be re quired in Ottawa to multiplex and reformat data for transmission to the IDC.
