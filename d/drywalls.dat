Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, void-free and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like <b>drywalls.</b> To distinguish this kind of construction from conventional <b>drywalls</b> with wall studs and gypsum panels or gypsum fiber boards, the construction with gypsum blocks {{is often referred to}} as massive drywall construction.|$|E

Tex is constantly having to stop Dez and Casey from installing the floors upside-down and backwards (i.e. tongue-on-tongue), while Charmaine and Joe install the drywall vertically instead of horizontally, leading to a structural weakness.

Penetrants may increase in length, push and pull as a result of operational temperature changes (e.g., hot and cold water in a pipe), particularly in a fire.

Different from the two other types of gypsum waste described above, this type of gypsum waste from renovation, refurbishment and demolition works {{is more likely to}} present a certain degree of contamination, which can be in the form of nails, screws, wood, insulation, wall coverings etc. For this waste to be recyclable it is required that the equipment processing the waste is capable of separating such contamination from the gypsum to arrive at a pure recycled gypsum.

Use of waste <b>drywalls</b> with flyash, as cement replacement in concrete and CLSM, have resulted in low strength mixes at initial & later ages, respectively. In this paper powdered <b>drywalls</b> with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), was used as secondary cementitious material along with stone dust as fine aggregates, to produce sustainable CLSM mixtures with varying binder ratios and water contents. Reduction in compressive strength at later ages was not observed for mixes with low water contents, hence use of GGBS instead of flyash with lesser water contents, is effective in resisting detrimental effects of sulfates present in <b>drywalls...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Drywalls</b> are {{the typical}} infill or {{partitions}} used in new structures. They are usually located within structural frames and/or between {{upper and lower}} floor slabs in buildings. Due to the materials used in their construction, unlike masonry blocks, they {{can be considered as}} light non-structural infill/partition walls. These types of walls are especially popular in New Zealand and the USA. In spite of their popularity, little is known about their in-plane cyclic behaviour when infilled within a structural frame. The cause of this lack of knowledge {{can be attributed to the}} typical assumption that they are weak nonstructural elements and are not expected to interact with the surrounding structural system significantly. However, recent earthquakes have repeatedly shown that <b>drywalls</b> interact with the structure and suffer severe damage at very low drift levels. In this paper, experimental test results of two typical drywall types (steel and timber framed) are reported in order to gather further information on; i) their reverse cyclic behaviour, ii) inter-storey drift levels at which they suffer different levels of damage, iii) the level of interaction with the surrounding structural frame system. The drywall specimens were tested using quasi-static reverse cyclic testing protocols within a full scale precast RC frame at the Structures Laboratory of the University of Canterbury...|$|E
30|$|However, for the De Vijvers building, an {{environment}} mainly consisting of concrete walls (versus the lighter layered <b>drywalls</b> in the Zuiderpoort building), the loss when propagating around corners {{appeared to be}} higher than for the Zuiderpoort building. The interaction loss for this environment was tuned to a value of 0.1946 dB/° or 17.5 dB/ 90 ° for concrete walls (see Figure 6, 'concrete'). In fact, it was only tuned for one of the twelve trajectories (T 5, a trajectory where the dominant path made a propagation direction change), so all other measured trajectories in this building can be considered as validation trajectories as well (see Table 1, column 'goal').|$|E
40|$|In most design codes, infill {{walls are}} {{considered}} as non-structural elements {{and thus are}} typically neglected in the design process. The observations made after major earthquakes (Duzce 1999, L’Aquila 2009, Christchurch 2011) have shown that even though infill walls {{are considered to be}} non-structural elements, they interact with the structural system during seismic actions. In the case of heavy infill walls (i. e. clay brick infill walls), the whole behaviour of the structure may be affected by this interaction (i. e. local or global structural failures such as soft storey mechanism). In the case of light infill walls (i. e. non-structural <b>drywalls),</b> this may cause significant economical losses. To consider the interaction of the structural system with the ‘non-structural ’infill walls at design stage may not be a practical approach due to the complexity of the infill wall behaviour. Therefore, the purpose of the reported research is to develop innovative technological solutions and design recommendations for low damage non-structural wall systems for seismic actions by making use of alternative approaches. Light (steel/timber framed <b>drywalls)</b> and heavy (unreinforced clay brick) non-structural infill wall systems were studied by following an experimental/numerical research programme. Quasi-static reverse cyclic tests were carried out by utilizing a specially designed full scale reinforced concrete frame, which {{can be used as a}} re-usable bare frame. In this frame, two RC beams and two RC columns were connected by two un-bonded post tensioning bars, emulating a jointed ductile frame system (PRESSS technology). Due to the rocking behaviour at the beam-column joint interfaces, this frame was typically a low damage structural solution, with the post-tensioning guaranteeing a linear elastic behaviour. Therefore, this frame could be repeatedly used in all of the tests carried out by changing only the infill walls within this frame. Due to the linear elastic behaviour of this structural bare frame, it was possible to extract the exact behaviour of the infill walls from the global results. In other words, the only parameter that affected the global results was given by the infill walls. For the test specimens, the existing practice of construction (as built) for both light and heavy non-structural walls was implemented. In the light of the observations taken during these tests, modified low damage construction practices were proposed and tested. In total, seven tests were carried out: 1) Bare frame, in order to confirm its linear elastic behaviour. 2) As built steel framed drywall specimen FIF 1 -STFD (Light) 3) As built timber framed drywall specimen FIF 2 -TBFD (Light) 4) As built unreinforced clay brick infill wall specimen FIF 3 -UCBI (Heavy) 5) Low damage steel framed drywall specimen MIF 1 -STFD (Light) 6) Low damage timber framed drywall specimen MIF 2 -TBFD (Light) 7) Low damage unreinforced clay brick infill wall specimen MIF 5 -UCBI (Heavy) The tests of the as built practices showed that both <b>drywalls</b> and unreinforced clay brick infill walls have a low serviceability inter-storey drift limit (0. 2 - 0. 3 %). Based on the observations, simple modifications and details were proposed for the low damage specimens. The details proved to be working effectively in lowering the damage and increasing the serviceability drift limits. For <b>drywalls,</b> the proposed low damage solutions do not introduce additional cost, material or labour and they are easily applicable in real buildings. For unreinforced clay brick infill walls, a light steel sub-frame system was suggested that divides the infill panel zone into smaller individual panels, which requires additional labour and some cost. However, both systems can be engineered for seismic actions and their behaviour can be controlled by implementing the proposed details. The performance of the developed details were also confirmed by the numerical case study analyses carried out using Ruaumoko 2 D on a reinforced concrete building model designed according to the NZ codes/standards. The results have confirmed that the implementation of the proposed low damage solutions is expected to significantly reduce the non-structural infill wall damage throughout a building...|$|E

For a broader assessment, the effects of three phase-change zones (narrow, intermediate and wide) of the PCM sample were considered. The results showed that the laminated PCM sample with a narrow phase-change zone was capable of increasing the minimum room temperature by about 17 % more than the randomly mixed type. Even though there was some display of a non-isothermal phase-change process, the laminated system proved to be thermally more effective in terms of evolution and utilisation of latent heat.

40|$|Past {{earthquakes}} {{have shown}} that the damage to non-structural elements can severely limit the functionality of most affected buildings and cause substantial economic losses. Among the non-structural building components, the ceiling-partition systems represent a large economic investment in construction sector. Nevertheless, their seismic performance is poorly understood, because information and specific guidance are very limited. In the last years, international studies have been conducted on the seismic behaviour of light gage steel stud partition walls (Lee et al. [1], Restrepo and Bersofsky [2], Tasligedik et al. [3], Retamales et al. [4], Magliulo at al. [5]), suspended ceilings (Badillo et al. [6], Magliulo et al. [7], Gilani et al. [8], Soroushian et al.

40|$|Non-structural drywall {{partitions}} are {{the most}} common lightweight partition type used in buildings (especially in US and NZ). They are usually bounded by either a structural frame or by two floor slabs, which makes them damage prone due to imposed inter-storey deformations. The loss of serviceability occurs at very low drift levels, sometimes lower than the design limits set by the current international standards. As part of a research programme for the development of low damage seismic solutions for non-structural vertical elements, experimental and numerical studies have been carried out. This paper will initially report the inherent low seismic performance of <b>drywalls</b> constructed as per typical practice. Then, the developed low damage solutions, capable of reaching high levels of drift without loss of serviceability will be reported.
