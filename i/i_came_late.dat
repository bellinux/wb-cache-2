One evening, as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> into Siena, the fire-flies were flying high on a stormy sirocco wind,--the stars themselves no brighter, and all their host seeming, at moments, to fade as the insects faded.|$|E
60|$|July 11.--The {{last day}} of the session, and as toilsome a one as I ever saw. There were about 100 or 120 cases on the roll, and most of them of an {{incidental}} character, which gives us Clerks the greatest trouble, for it is the grasshopper that is a burthen to us. Came home about four, tired and hungry. I wrought little or none; indeed I could not, having books and things to pack. Went in the evening to sup with John Murray,[299] where I met Will Clerk, Thomson, Henderland, and Charles Stuart Blantyre, and had of course a pleasant party. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> home, though, for me, and was not in bed till past midnight; it would not do for me to do this often.|$|E
6000|$|And little Dagonet on the morrow morn, High {{over all}} the {{yellowing}} Autumn-tide, Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall. Then Tristram saying, [...] "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?" [...] Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet replied, [...] "Belike for lack of wiser company; Or being fool, and seeing too much wit Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip To know myself the wisest knight of all." [...] "Ay, fool," [...] said Tristram, [...] "but 'tis eating dry To dance without a catch, a roundelay To dance to." [...] Then he twangled on his harp, And while he twangled little Dagonet stood, Quiet as any water-sodden log Stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook; But when the twangling ended, skipt again; Then being ask'd, [...] "Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?" [...] Made answer, [...] "I had liefer twenty years Skip to the broken music of my brains Than any broken music ye can make." [...] Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come, [...] "Good now, what music have I broken, fool?" [...] And little Dagonet, skipping, [...] "Arthur, the king's; For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt, Thou makest broken music with thy bride, Her daintier namesake down in Brittany-- And so thou breakest Arthur's music too." [...] "Save for that broken music in thy brains, Sir Fool," [...] said Tristram, [...] "I would break thy head. Fool, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late,</b> the heathen wars were o'er, The life had flown, we sware but by the shell-- I am but a fool to reason with a fool Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down, Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears, And hearken if my music be not true.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{the dreadful}} little old tradition, {{one of the}} platitudes of the human comedy, that people's moral scheme DOES break down in Paris; that nothing is more {{frequently}} observed; that {{hundreds of thousands of}} more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons annually visit the place {{for the sake of the}} probable catastrophe, and that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> in the day to work myself up about it. There was in fine the TRIVIAL association, one of the vulgarest in the world; but which give me pause no longer, I think, simply because its vulgarity is so advertised. The revolution performed by Strether under the influence of the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with any betise of the imputably [...] "tempted" [...] state; he was to be thrown forward, rather, thrown quite with violence, upon his lifelong trick of intense reflexion: which friendly test indeed was to bring him out, through winding passages, through alternations of darkness and light, very much IN Paris, but with the surrounding scene itself a minor matter, a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the philosophy of Woollett. Another surrounding scene would have done as well for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether's errand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him. The LIKELY place had the great merit of sparing me preparations; there would have been too many involved--not at all impossibilities, only rather worrying and delaying difficulties--in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome's interesting relation, his so interesting complexity of relations. Strether's appointed stage, in fine, could be but Chad's most luckily selected one. The young man had gone in, as they say, for circumjacent charm; and where he would have found it, by the turn of his mind, most [...] "authentic," [...] was where his earnest friend's analysis would most find HIM; as well as where, for that matter, the former's whole analytic faculty would be led such a wonderful dance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bravissimo!" [...] she cried. [...] "There {{is a word}} {{well said}} at last, and I will reward you for it with my story. That same night of your {{desertion}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> from a friend's house--where I was excessively admired, whatever you may think of it--and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me? She had been there an hour or better, said the servant-lass, and she grat in {{to herself as she}} sat waiting. I went to her direct; she rose as I came in, and I knew her at a look. ('Grey Eyes!' says I to myself, but was more wise than to let on.) You will be Miss Grant at last? she says, rising and looking at me hard and pitiful. Ay, it was true he said, you are bonny, at all events.--The way God made me, my dear, I said, but I would be geyan obliged if ye could tell me what brought you here at such a time of the night.--Lady, she said, we are kinsfolk, we are both come of the blood of the sons of Alpin.--My dear, I replied, I think no more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kale-stock. You have a better argument in these tears upon your bonny face. And at that I was so weak-minded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do dearly, and I wager will never find the courage of. I say it was weak-minded of me, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it was the wisest stroke I could have hit upon. She is a very staunch, brave nature, but I think she has been little used with tenderness; and at that caress (though to say the truth, it was but lightly given) her heart went out to me. I will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb, because it is the same she will use to twist yourself. Ay, it is a fine lass! She is as clean as hill well-water." ...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> to {{the academy}} and am still more of a trade unionist than a scholar, so I am going to start my remarks from this perspective. When Jim wrote Values and Assumptions I was in my earlier life as a union staffer with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), a great, democratic, {{independent}} left-wing union. Like everyone else on the union staff, I was a generalist and an itinerant. I received organizing and bargaining assignments in New England, the Carolinas, and Baltimore, corporate campaign assignments in South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and California, political and legislative assignments in Washington, {{and a dozen other}} projects. It was nonstop action from the time I started working for the UE after finishing law school in 1973...|$|E
40|$|I {{came into}} this {{dialogue}} “sideways. ” I was neither a panel member nor did I {{take part in the}} subsequent conversation because <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>late</b> to the Academy symposium, missing all of Jennifer’s presentation and most of Tammar’s. I did really enjoy the part of the conversation on institutional theory and organizational culture for which I was able to be present. Moreover, it was good to sit and listen to others. However, when I got back to Alberta I found myself reflecting on some aspects of the session and so sent an email to Jennifer, Mary Jo, Majken, and Tammar to share my reflections with them. Those reflections must have struck a chord as, somewhat to my surprise, I was asked to take part in this dialogue! So, my aim is to develop further the very outline remarks that I made in my email. The questions that are posed in this dialogue primarily relate to the absence of interplay between cultural studies of organizations and institutional approaches and how this might be changed. The issue was raised, “Why don’t organi-zational scholars who study ‘culture ’ also study ‘institutions,’ and vice versa? ” Of course, the answer might be that they do, but they use different concepts. It is this possibility, with respect to institutional theory, that I wish to explore here. This situation arises from increasing interest in beliefs, val-ues, and systems of meaning and the way they shape fields, organizations, and institutional work. Indeed, Greenwood, Oliver, Sahlin, and Suddaby (2008) suggest that there is a stream of institutional theory that is cognitive and social con-structivist in emphasis. The Greenwood, Oliver, Sahlin, et al. (2008) introductory chapter in the Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism outlines a number of stages in the development of institutional theory. Much of the development has been from a rich por-trayal of institutional fields and institutionalized organizations (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977), through a somewhat limited notion of institutional theory (see Mizruchi & Fein, 1999), to an increasing rediscovery of the original richness of concepts and processes within the theory (cf...|$|E

The devil of jealousy, {{and that}} of avarice, both, I believe, possest him; or your son was innocently talking with his wife, and he perhaps had found them; this I guess, but saw it not, because <b>I</b> <b>came</b> too <b>late.</b> <b>I</b> only viewed the sweet youth just expiring, and Towerson stooping down to take the ring; she {{kneeling}} by to help him: when he saw me, he would, you may be sure, have sent me after, because I was a witness of the fact.

And to aggravate my trouble, the Tempter presented to my mind those good people of Bedford, and suggested thus unto me, that these being converted already, they were all that God would save in those parts; and that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> too <b>late,</b> for these had got the blessing before <b>I</b> <b>came.</b>|$|R
