5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
2500|$|In the Pine Barrens, forest <b>fire</b> <b>has</b> been {{a common}} {{occurrence}} before habitation by humans. <b>Fire</b> <b>has</b> played a major ecological role in the Pinelands, and the ecotypes [...] "suggest that short <b>fire</b> intervals may <b>have</b> been typical in the Pine Plains for many centuries, or millennia."

5|$|At {{about this}} time, Nasu's left wing battalions {{finally began to}} reach the Marine defenses. At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under Captain Jiro Katsumata found and {{attacked}} Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's attack was impeded by heavy barbed wire {{in front of the}} Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> killed most of Katsumata's company.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{military}} involvement, the Orel also temporarily provided {{shelter for}} some of the residents who had evacuated the town.

5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> been admitted, many {{suffering}} from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E

5|$|Despite the near-debacle, the {{commitment}} of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> made the main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.|$|E
5|$|During the ten and a {{half hours}} that it burned, the <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> {{destroyed}} buildings from Broad Street below Wall Street to Stone Street, up Whitehall Street to Bowling Green, and up Broadway to Exchange Place. Four firefighters and 26 civilians lost their lives, and buildings were reported destroyed on Broadway, New Street, Broad Street, Exchange Place, Beaver Street, Marketfield Street, Whitehall Street, and South William Street. All told, the fire destroyed 345 buildings {{in the southern part of}} what is now the Financial District, resulting in property damage estimated at the time between $5 million and $10 million. In today's currency, damages would be between $ and $.|$|E
5|$|Failed {{oxygen and}} {{ethylene}} glycol pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters {{were able to}} open the hatch, the <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch {{was found in the}} horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.|$|E
50|$|Investigations by {{specialist}} {{crews of}} the extent of damage <b>fires</b> <b>have</b> wrought commenced in February with the first focus on fire grounds near Cradle Mountain and Lake Mackenzie in the Central Plateau.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center.

5|$|On 3 April, {{given the}} {{deterioration}} in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians {{over the next seven}} days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105mm artillery and 107mm rocket fire each day. By 10 April Khmer Rouge <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> become so heavy that the fixed-wing evacuation was ended.|$|E
5|$|On Nørregade, another {{fire started}} at a brewery Wednesday evening – {{possibly}} between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just {{prior to that}} the original <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> reached Gammeltorv, where people fought to keep the fire back. For that reason, help was sent late {{to deal with the}} new fire. Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day Nørre Voldgade towards Nørreport (North Gate).|$|E

5|$|Operation Donnerkeil {{had been}} an {{outstanding}} success for the Luftwaffe. The measure of success lay not in the ratio of losses, which amounted to 2:1 in the German favour, but {{the failure of the}} RAF, FAA and Royal Navy to intercept or at least inflict severe damage to the German warships. The meagre forces committed by the Navy had been repulsed easily by the German warships and their escorts. Heavy AAA <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> offered a helpful defence against air attack, but the German air defence had succeeded, along with poor weather, in breaking up RAF assaults on the ships. Galland, responsible for the plan, called it the high point of his career.|$|E
5|$|The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an {{organisation}} run {{by several}} insurance {{companies in the}} absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00pm, by which time the <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrate}} {{also made}} {{a survey of the}} spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749former residents of the parts touched by <b>fire</b> <b>had</b> found new lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of dead and wounded is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, but the number remains uncertain. It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire, though.|$|E
