An <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection</b> concept has been developed by Sandia National Laboratories that uses a robotic vehicle rather than a conventional pig for <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection.</b> This vehicle could be capable of negotiating tight bends, obstructions, varying pipe diameter, and out-of-round sections.

Technical Perspective Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) is a common technique used to inspect large diameter gas transmission pipelines. With {{hundreds of thousands of}} miles of transmission pipeline in service, high inspection velocities are desirable. Also, the typical product flow velocity in transmission pipelines often exceeds 10 miles per hour, and tool velocity during an inspection can fluctuate widely.

40|$|International audienceIn {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, <b>in-line</b> <b>inspections</b> {{are necessary}} to monitor processes, products and tools {{in order to reduce}} excursions and achieve high yields of final products. However, capacity is limited and inspections directly impact the cycle times of products. Sampling strategies are used to improve product yields while limiting the number of inspections, and thus the impact on the cycle times of the inspected lots. Dynamic sampling has been recently introduced and new models are required to estimate the associated inspection capacity. In this paper, we focus on micro defect inspections and the risk on process tools in terms of Wafers at Risk (W@R), which is the number of wafers processed on a tool since its latest defect inspection. A linear programming model that estimates the required defect inspection capacity to satisfy the W@R limits on process tools is proposed. Our model can be used at different decision levels. At the tactical level, it shows if W@R limits can be satisfied when the product mix changes and/or if planned W@R reductions can be met with the available inspection capacity. At the strategic level, the model helps to justify capacity investments if the objectives in terms of W@R reduction cannot be achieved with the available capacity.

40|$|Abstract. While data {{acquisition}} for MFL-Inspection {{is not an}} especially complex method, the off-line analysis and defect size reconstruction requires more sophisticated methods. It has been established that a full reconstruction of the flaw geometry is rarely possible. However the approaches that exist differ by the degree of reliability. The experimental side is represented here by data of intelligent pigs obtained by <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection</b> of pipelines. The problem with <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection</b> is, {{that the number of}} flaws usually does not allow for an in-depth treatment of every single item. Lengthy iterative or 3 D-FEM solutions are not practical. Methods that have earlier been developed for magnetic flux leakage have more commonly been applied to crack-like features in component testing. Sherbinin [1] has given formulas for the stray flux expected on crack-like features depending on crack opening and depth. In <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection</b> this type of flaw is rarely found due to the small crack opening of typical pipeline cracks. For corrosion-type flaws the profile of the flaw is too irregular to apply closed form formulas. In the <b>in-line</b> <b>inspection</b> industry methods have thus been established, that quickly convert characteristic signal features into measures for flaw depth, flaw length and flaw width. Deconvolution methods with a transfer function are not very common. In this work we compare the efficiency of a method based on a simple signal parameter conversion to a neural network based method. In both cases the parameters are set by actual tool measurements obtained by pulling an inspection tool through a pipe with known artificial defects. It is discussed how the methods perform when interpolating and extrapolating to flaw sizes, that are not previously tested. 1...|$|E

These defects were manufactured with different opening width and orientation. After full-scale burst tests, the real morphology of the girth weld defects were examined by fracture analysis. The defect data and experimental results were obtained and used to FFS assessment, where FFS methods included API 579, BS 7910, Miller, Kastner etc. Error analysis results were illustrated by comparing the experimental data and the assessment results, and suggested that fracture failure should be considered for girth-weld defects assessment in a conservative view at last...|$|R

This paper presents signal amplitude model in inspection of steel plate in terms of magnetic current, static magnetic field and thickness of plate using response surface methodology. The established equation shows that the magnetic current was found to be main influencing factor on the signal amplitude. The variance analysis for the polynomial model reveals that the interaction terms and the square terms for static magnetic field except the interaction with magnetic current were statistically insignificant. However, it could be seen that the second-order effect of static magnetic field is significant. After magnetic current, thickness of plate is the most influencing factor on signal amplitude while the impact of static magnetic field is negligible...|$|E
