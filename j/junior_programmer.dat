5000|$|Diskworld was {{originally}} designed and created by Sean Golden (Managing Editor), Jeff Billings (Senior Programmer) and Lynda Fowler (<b>Junior</b> <b>Programmer).</b> Sean Golden wrote the original Diskworld [...] "shell" [...] program which provided {{access to the}} monthly disk contents. He also wrote most of the editorial content each month. Jeff Billings and Lynda Fowler developed monthly productivity, utility or game programs which were published on the disk. Jeff and Lynda also provided some editorial content, and Sean also contributed programs. Free-lance programmers also provided content for a fee. The product was broken down into editorials, articles, reviews, artwork and software, all presented with the custom [...] "shell" [...] program which allowed users to run the disk without having to swap out system disks on the original Macintosh. The early issues were published on 400K disks, but moved to 800K disks when the 400K disks become obsolete.|$|E
40|$|A SAS mentor {{can be a}} {{valuable}} resource to junior programmers just starting out, or programmers who may have used other high level languages and {{are just starting to}} use SAS. The paper will focus on preparing a plan for a hypothetical <b>junior</b> <b>programmer,</b> with the goal of becoming a more proficient programmer over a one or two year period. SAS, unlike some other languages does not lend itself to being self-taught and some things that might look like an obvious choice can actually lead to performance penalties. The most important thing that mentors can provide is guidance – for things worth studying more and things that might be interesting, but you might only use infrequently...|$|E
40|$|Recently and I {{have had}} reason to look through some old {{software}} engineering textbooks, {{the kind of thing}} I used to read as an undergraduate and <b>junior</b> <b>programmer.</b> This is reminded me of a few concepts I haven't thought about in several years. One of these is egoless programming. As I recall my university lecturers where very keen on this concept, {{it seemed to be a}} good thing. Although, to be honest, I’ve always had my doubts [...] . What exactly is egoless programming? I guess it all depends on what you mean by ego, so I turned to my favourite text on management and psychological (and all that kind of stuff) where I found the following definition: “ego has to make sense of the internal conflict in our mind between the id and superego and the external world. The ego is the decision-making part of personality and is engaged in rational and logical thinking. It is governed by the reality principle. " (Mullins, 2002) Now this looks a bit confusing. Does egoless programming mean programming without rational and logical thinking? Well, I’ve seen my fair share programs and I must say a lot of them do seem a lack rational and logical thinking, but I really don't think anyone wants to advocate this is a design and programming technique. What would an irrational program look like? What would an illogica...|$|E
