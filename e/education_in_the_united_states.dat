5|$|Georgetown is {{the oldest}} Catholic and Jesuit-affiliated {{institution}} of higher <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The Jesuits {{have participated in the}} university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805; however, the university has always been governed independently of the church. At present, the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the {{property}} was sold and the Chana School was nearly demolished. Citizens formed the Chana School Foundation to save the building. It was relocated to City Park East in Oregon, Illinois and volunteers began the process of refurbishing the building in August 1998. Five years later, in September 2003, the school had its grand opening. Since then, it has operated as a museum to help illustrate 1880s <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jesuit {{settlers}} from England {{founded the}} Province of Maryland in 1634. However, the 1646 {{defeat of the}} Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary Andrew White, {{and the destruction of}} their school at Calverton Manor. During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until {{after the end of the}} American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> were realized.|$|E

5|$|Kahin {{helped develop}} Indonesian {{studies in the}} United States {{at a time when}} the {{majority}} of material on Indonesia was held at Leiden University in the Netherlands. At Cornell, he introduced a postgraduate education program for diplomats from around the world who were in the middle of their careers. He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals, including Deliar Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan, obtain <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Several of Kahin's students and associates, including Herbert Feith, went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught.|$|E
5|$|De Mena {{was born}} into a Creole family in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and {{obtained}} her <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> before marrying a Nicaraguan and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became {{one of the leaders of}} the pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization in the Caribbean and Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.|$|E
5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E

5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Supporters rallied and {{collected}} funds for Johnson to complete her <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and she enrolled at New York University, completing her Doctor of Education in 1962. When suffrage passed in 1961, Johnson immediately entered the fray, accepting a nomination as a PLP {{candidate for the}} Eleuthera District. She wrote a booklet entitled The Next Step: Votes for Women in which she explained useful information for voting, {{such as how to}} register to vote and cast a ballot. She lost the race, but three years later participated in a debate in the push for majority rule on the parliamentary imbalance in the Bahamas with a delegation from the PLP at the United Nations. At that meeting, she met the president of her alma mater from Virginia Union, and agreed to accept a teaching post at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A little over a year later, Johnson left Louisiana and came back to the Bahamas to participate in the 1967 elections. The PLP won the majority of seats and she became the first woman appointee to serve in the Bahamian Senate. One of her first acts was to form a committee to help the Haitian diaspora who had fled to the Bahamas because of unrest in their own country. With an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees and a government decree to stop issuing work permits to Haitians, the situation was critical. The following year, PLP had a landslide victory in the 1968 election and Johnson was reappointed to the Senate, and appointed as the first woman to lead government business.|$|E
