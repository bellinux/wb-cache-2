50|$|From 1912, Krauch was {{employed}} at BASF, later I.G. Farbenindustrie AG. He was a longstanding {{member of the}} board and general committee, and chairman of the supervisory board, 1940 to 1945, succeeding Carl Bosch as chairman. From 1936, Krauch was head of the Research and Development Department of the Amt für Deutsche Roh- und Werkstoffe. From 1939, he was head of the renamed Reichsamtes für Wirtschaftsausbau (Reich Office for Economic Expansion), established in 1936 as part of the Four-Year Plan to achieve national economic self-sufficiency and promote industrial production especially for rearmament. The Amt für Deutsche Roh- und Werkstoffe was nicknamed the Amt für IG-Farben Ausbau ("Office for the Expansion of IG Farben"), due to his <b>dual</b> <b>head</b> positions.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of lathes within the metalworking field. Some variations {{are not all}} that obvious, and others are more a niche area. For example, a centering lathe is a <b>dual</b> <b>head</b> machine where the work remains fixed and the heads move towards the workpiece and machine a center drill hole into each end. The resulting workpiece may then be used [...] "between centers" [...] in another operation.The usage of the term metal lathe may also be considered somewhat outdated these days, plastics and other composite materials are in wide use and with appropriate modifications, the same principles and techniques may be applied to their machining as that used for metal.|$|E

40|$|In data {{gathering}} wireless sensor networks, data loss often happens due to external faults such as random link faults and hazard node faults, since sensor nodes have constrained resources {{and are often}} deployed in inhospitable environments. However, already known fault tolerance mechanisms often bring new internal faults (e. g. out-of-power faults and collisions on wireless bandwidth) to the original network and dissipate lots of extra energy and time to reduce data loss. Therefore, we propose a novel <b>Dual</b> Cluster <b>Heads</b> Cooperation (CoDuch) scheme to tolerate external faults while introducing less internal faults and dissipating less extra energy and time. In CoDuch scheme, <b>dual</b> cluster <b>heads</b> cooperate {{with each other to}} reduce extra costs by sending only one copy of sensed data to the Base Station; also, <b>dual</b> cluster <b>heads</b> check errors with each other during the collecting data process. Two algorithms are developed based on the CoDuch scheme: CoDuch-l for tolerating link faults and CoDuch-b for tolerating both link faults and node faults; theory and experimental study validate their effectiveness and efficiency. ...|$|R

50|$|Most DVI {{connector}} types - {{the exception}} being DVI-A - contain pins that pass digital video signals. These {{come in two}} varieties: single link and dual link. Single link DVI employs a single 165 MHz transmitter that supports resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 at 60 Hz. Dual link DVI adds six additional pins (located {{in the center of}} the connector) for a second transmitter increasing the bandwidth and supporting resolutions up to 2560 × 1600 at 60 Hz. A connector with these additional pins is sometimes referred to as DVI-DL (dual link). Dual link should not be confused with dual display (also known as <b>dual</b> <b>head),</b> which is a configuration consisting of a single computer connected to two monitors, sometimes using a DMS-59 connector for two single link DVI connections.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{primarily}} shot in Canberra over a two-week period {{during the winter}} of 1996 and additional scenes were shot during early 1997. Post-production on the film was completed in 1998. A large number of the interior locations were shot in the (now demolished) Royal Canberra Hospital which was de-commissioned in 1991 and remained vacant for many years before the building was imploded in July 1997. Cthulhu was produced on a very low budget and was shot on 16mm film and was later transferred to digital Betacam for finishing. A rough cut, <b>dual</b> <b>head</b> print was screened for Miramax in the Australian Film, Television and Radio School's theatre in the hopes of obtaining finishing funds but was not ultimately purchased.
