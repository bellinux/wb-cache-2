25|$|The Metropolitan Transit Authority {{provides}} bus transit {{within the}} city, {{out of a}} newly built <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> downtown. Routes utilize a hub and spoke method. Expansion plans include use of Bus rapid transit for new routes, with the possibility for local rail service {{at some point in}} the future.|$|E
25|$|Plans for the {{restoration}} were threatened in 2103 when the route of High Speed 2, a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and York, were published. This envisaged an East Midlands <b>Hub</b> <b>station</b> at Toton, which would have destroyed part of the canal route, but revised plans were published on 15 November 2016, with the station moved to avoid the canal. The chairman of the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust, Chris Madge, was still concerned that a tramway to link the station to Derby would impinge upon the canal, but was hopeful that the canal in this area could be reopened before tramway construction began, and that {{the plans for the}} tramway would therefore have to accommodate the canal.|$|E
25|$|A {{commuter}} train system, the Long Island Rail Road, operates 22 stations in Queens with service to Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. Jamaica station is a <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> {{where all the}} lines in the system but one (the Port Washington Branch) converge. It is the busiest commuter rail hub in the United States. Sunnyside Yard {{is used as a}} staging area by Amtrak and NJ Transit for intercity and {{commuter train}}s from Penn Station in Manhattan. 61st Street – Woodside acts as one of the many LIRR connections to the New York City Subway. The elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road along the Van Wyck Expressway; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems. Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport itself in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities, and this project would accommodate the new AirTrain connection.|$|E

5000|$|Meredith Corporation {{controls}} {{all of its}} <b>stations</b> {{from two}} <b>hubs.</b> <b>Stations</b> east of the Rockies are operated from WGCL in Atlanta, Georgia, {{and all of its}} stations out West are controlled from KPHO in Phoenix, Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|Nashville International Airport - American saw a {{decrease}} in passenger traffic and closed its Nashville hub in the mid 1990s to cut costs. Former AA CEO, Bob Crandall, stated in a 2006 interview that he wished American never closed their Nashville hub. As of 2017, BNA is one of American's largest non <b>hub</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|One {{long-term}} possibility {{might be}} an underground extension of another mile or two to a future high-rise housing district, or to a multi-modal transportation <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, a distance of approximately four miles. It would possibly go under Vineland Avenue and Vanowen Street. In 2006 {{a large number of}} housing units, including a high-rise tower was completed very near the North Hollywood (NoHo Arts District) station.|$|E
2500|$|The Jamaica {{station is}} a major <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> and {{transfer}} point in Jamaica, Queens. It has eight tracks and five platforms, plus yard and bypass tracks. Passengers can transfer between trains on all LIRR lines except the Port Washington Branch. Transfer is also made to separate facilities for three subway services at the Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK station (...) , a number of bus routes, and the AirTrain automated electric rail system to JFK Airport. The railroad's headquarters are next to the station.|$|E
2500|$|Miller Beach {{is served}} by the Route 13 buses of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation (GPTC), which do a full circle of the {{neighborhood}} and terminate at the GPTC <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> at Gary Metro Center in downtown Gary. [...] At the Metro Center, passengers can transfer to buses serving other parts of Gary and towns as distant as Hammond and Crown Point.

2500|$|On February 7, 2007, CBS {{agreed to}} sell seven of its smaller-market {{stations}} to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., for $185 million. Cerberus then formed a new holding company for the stations, Four Points Media Group, {{who took over the}} operation of the stations through local marketing agreements in late-June 2007. The deal closed on January 10, 2008. Although the URL for the WWHB website has not changed since the sale to Four Points, it now redirects to a separate section of WTVX's website. [...] As of February 25, 2008, the station is now being operated out of Four Points' <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> KUTV in Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E
2500|$|The St. Louis {{metro area}} {{is served by}} Metrolink (known as Metro) and is the 11th-largest light rail system {{in the country with}} 46mi (74km) of double track light rail. The Red Line and The Blue Line both serve all the {{stations}} in the inner city, and branch to different destinations beyond in the suburban areas. Both lines enter the city north of Forest Park on {{the western edge of the}} city or on the Eads Bridge in downtown St. Louis to Illinois. All of the system track is in independent right of way, with both surface level and underground subways track in the city. All stations are independent entry, while all platforms are flush-level with trains. Rail service is provided by the Bi-State Development Agency (also known as Metro), which is funded by a sales taxes levied in the city and other counties in the region. The Gateway Multimodal Transportation Center acts as the <b>hub</b> <b>station</b> in the city of St. Louis, linking the city's light rail system, local bus system, passenger rail service, and national bus service. [...] It is located just east of the historic grand St. Louis Union Station.|$|E

2500|$|Transportation {{advocates in}} Boston {{have complained that}} rail transit riders cannot travel from one {{outlying}} area to another without first traveling to the downtown <b>hub</b> <b>stations,</b> changing lines, and traveling outbound again. Some of the radial transit lines, notably the Green Line, are so overcrowded that service is very slow, unreliable, and capacity-limited because of rush-hour [...] "crush loads". There are several crosstown bus lines, such as the #1, #66, CT1, CT2, and CT3 routes, but they are slow, unreliable, and subject to bus bunching because they must operate in mixed street traffic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In cities, {{there are}} {{a large number of}} bus routes and stations. Bus {{information}} management system is a public system that people often use, and the route query {{is one of the key}} technologies. This paper mainly discusses a transfer algorithm based on set theory, and the design process of the algorithm is given. Then, improved algorithms are presented. The transfer algorithm based on <b>hub</b> <b>stations</b> greatly reduce the amount of calculation, and may be the most practical algorithm. These algorithms are simple and effective, and may improve the speed of the system...|$|R
50|$|On 27 March 1985 SFR {{presented}} the Transport Department {{with a new}} project draft. This was met with a positive response from the political parties and associations; the Neue Zürcher Zeitung called the concept attractive, flexible and evolutionary. The aim of the concept was to connect the main <b>hub</b> <b>stations</b> {{in less than an}} hour (particularly Zürich, Bern and Lausanne) so that trains could arrive before the hour or half hour and depart again shortly thereafter. Trains therefore would have to run as fast as necessary to meet this object, not as fast as possible.|$|R

5000|$|The city's main railway <b>hub,</b> Nagano <b>Station,</b> and {{the smaller}} Shinonoi Station, were {{expanded}} for the Olympics. The Hokuriku Shinkansen opened in 1997 (initially named the [...] "Nagano Shinkansen"), connecting Nagano to Takasaki, Gunma.|$|R
2500|$|All four subway lines cross downtown, {{forming a}} {{quadrilateral}} configuration, and the Orange and Green Lines (which run approximately parallel in that district) also connect directly at two stations {{just north of}} downtown. The Red Line and Blue Line are the only pair of subway lines which {{do not have a}} direct transfer connection to each other. Because the various subway lines do not consistently run in any given compass direction, it is customary to refer to line directions as [...] "inbound" [...] or [...] "outbound". [...] Inbound trains travel towards the four downtown transfer stations, and outbound trains travel away from these <b>hub</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The MBTA Urban Ring Project {{would provide}} {{faster and more}} {{reliable}} circumferential service, and relieve overcrowding in the downtown <b>hub</b> <b>stations.</b> [...] This issue has been studied as early as 1972, in the Boston Transportation Planning Review, {{and has been in}} detailed planning stages since before 2000, but has only been partially implemented due to lack of funding. A similar problem also occurs in the Washington Metro system, where customers cannot travel between suburbs {{on the same side of}} Washington without going through downtown, and Chicago's Metra and CTA systems, where all lines lead into and out of the central business district, rather than around it.|$|R
