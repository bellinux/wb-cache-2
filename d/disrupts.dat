40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{extremely}} high blood thrombogenicity {{has been reported}} in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it has not been clarified if the increased blood thrombogenicity is a cause of acute myocardial infarction or a mere result induced by thrombus formation at the <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Therefore, we examined if blood thrombogenicity is extremely increased as in acute myocardial infarction patients when <b>disrupted</b> plaque is present in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Methods and resultsConsecutive patients (n= 38) with stable coronary artery disease who received angioscopic examination were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to presence or absence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque that accompanied thrombus. Blood thrombogenicity was evaluated by blood vulnerability index and compared between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Among 38 study patients, 16 had <b>disrupted</b> plaque and 22 did not. Blood vulnerability index was not different between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque (2395 ± 612 vs. 3013 ± 1476, p= 0. 12). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant association between blood vulnerability index and the presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque. ConclusionThe presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque, in comparison with its absence, was not associated with higher blood thrombogenicity evaluated by blood vulnerability index...|$|R

5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying.

Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees <b>disrupts</b> foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides.

5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier <b>disrupts</b> their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
40|$|The {{links between}} {{unresolved}} maternal attachment status, <b>disrupted</b> maternal interaction in play situa-tions, and disorganized attachment relationships {{were examined in}} a study of 82 adolescent mother– infant dyads.

Additional rating scales were developed to correspond to the 5 dimensions of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior outlined by E. Bronfman, E. Parsons, and K. Lyons-Ruth (1999). A robust association was observed between <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior and disorganized attachment. Ratings of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior revealed that disorganized attachment relationships were strongly related to ratings of fearful/disoriented behavior. Moreover, mothers who were unresolved were more likely than not-unresolved mothers to show <b>disrupted</b> patterns of interaction with their infants. Regression analyses suggested that <b>disrupted</b> behavior statistically mediated the association between unresolved status and disorganized attachment relationships...|$|R

5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which <b>disrupts</b> {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, {{we argue that}} the neighborhood-level of <b>disrupted</b> family {{processes}} (weak social ties to parents and coercive family interaction) should have a contextual effect on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), because adolescents living in neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are prevalent should {{be more likely to}} associate with deviant (substance using) peers. We use nested data on 5491 Icelandic adolescents aged 15 and 16 years in 83 neighborhoods to examine the neighborhood-contextual effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), that is, whether neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are common have more adolescent substance use, even after partialling out the individual-level effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on substance use. As predicted, we find that the neighborhood-levels of <b>disrupted</b> family processes have significant, contextual effects on all the indicators of substance use, and that association with substance using peers mediates a part of these contextual effects. The findings illustrate the limitation of an individual-level approach to adolescent substance use.

5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage <b>disrupts</b> the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E

In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and <b>disrupts</b> local ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it <b>disrupts</b> the game's narrative.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: â-Amyloid (Aâ), {{the primary}} protein {{component}} of Alzheimer’s plaques, is neurotoxic when aggregated into fibrils. We have devised a modular strategy for generating compounds that inhibit Aâ toxicity. These compounds contain a recognition element, designed to bind to Aâ, {{linked to a}} <b>disrupting</b> element, designed to interfere with Aâ aggregation. On {{the basis of this}} strategy, a hybrid peptide was synthesized with the sequence KLVFF (residues 16 - 20 of Aâ) as the recognition element and a lysine hexamer as the <b>disrupting</b> element; this compound protects cells in vitro from Aâ toxicity [Pallitto, M. M., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 3570]. To determine if the length of the <b>disrupting</b> element could be reduced, peptides were synthesized that contained the KLVFF recognition element and a sequence of one to six lysines as <b>disrupting</b> elements. All compounds enhanced the rate of aggregation of Aâ, with the magnitude of the effect increasing as the number of lysines in the <b>disrupting</b> element increased. The greatest level of protection against Aâ toxicity was achieved with compounds containing <b>disrupting</b> elements of three or more lysines in sequence. A peptide with an anionic <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFEEEE, had activity similar to that of KLVFFKKKK, in both cellular toxicity and biophysical assays, whereas a peptide with a neutral polar <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFSSSS, was ineffective. Protective compounds retained activity even at an inhibitor:Aâ molar ratio of 1 : 100, making these some of the most effective inhibitor...|$|R
