40|$|Mixed polymer-surfactant films at the {{air-water}} interface {{have been}} studied using neutron reflectivity. When poly(dimethylsiloxane) is spread on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> a surfactant layer, the resultant mixed film is a superposition of two layers: one surfactant-rich and one polymer-rich. The composition and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layers depend on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surfactant. We find significant penetration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer into a monolayer of single-chain nonionic surfactant, C 10 E 5. For a double-chain anionic surfactant, AOT, no <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two layers is detected. This difference is most probably due to <b>the</b> greater flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 10 E 5 monolayer compared to that <b>of</b> AOT. <b>The</b> higher degree <b>of</b> hydration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonionic surfactant layer could {{also play a role}} in <b>the</b> mixing behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer and surfactant layers. <b>The</b> molecular thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer layer indicates a flat two-dimensional conformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spread polymer.

It is oriented to allow limited free but not unrealistic <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side chains <b>of</b> protein surface amino acid residues. The central step to the technique is a filtering process {{similar to those in}} image processing. The methodology assists in deletion of atomic-scale details on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interacting monomers, leading to <b>the</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most characteristic flattened shape for the molecule as well as <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> a soft layer of atoms to allow smooth <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interacting molecules during the docking process. Although the methodology does not perform structural or conformational rearrangements in the interacting monomers, results output by the algorithm are in fair agreement with <b>the</b> relative position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monomer in experimentally reported complexes.
