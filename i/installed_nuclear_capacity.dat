40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced Converter Reactors (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced converter reactors, their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used up in burners. Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total <b>installed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030. The analysis shows that a combination of advanced and burner reactors, as compared to the use of burners only, could lead to cumulative, high-grade uranium savings greater than 70...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the path to}} reach sustainable fuel cycles with Th-fuelled thermal breeder reactors. To achieve a successful synergy between radiotoxic waste transmutation from water cooled reactors and breeding of the new fuel in the Th- 233 U cycle, fast reactors (FRs) are applied to transmute minor actinides (MAs). It is shown that near-term 233 U breeding in PWR and FR cores is feasible. Over 100 kg of 233 U could be produced annually in PWR cores with 30 % of sub-assemblies containing ThO 2, which means that one 850 MWe pressurized heavy water moderated thermal self-breeder could be started every 16 years. A slightly higher figure, over 120 kg/yr of 233 U, was obtained when 30 % of UO 2 pins in each sub-assembly were exchanged for ThO 2 pins. Fast reactors employing (Th,TRU) O 2 fuel produced up to 370 kg of 233 U annually, which means that a new self-breeder could be started roughly every 4. 4 years. At the same time, 78 kg of minor actinides are consumed annually. By {{the end of this}} century, PWRs and FRs could generate enough 233 U to sustain an increase in <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacities</b> to 1160 GWe, which represents more than a three-fold increase of <b>installed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacities</b> worldwide.

40|$|In this paper, we derive a {{simultaneous}} {{system of equations}} which aims at analysing the uranium supply and demand. In addition to reviewing and updating previous studies dealing with the uranium market analysis, in particular Amavilah (1995), {{the contribution of the}} paper lies in putting attention to some questions which are still either controversial or unanswered. They are especially related to the controversial hypothesis of the interdependence between uranium market and other commodities markets, both, with respect to the demand side, i. e. oil and coal markets, and the supply side, i. e. gold market. The paper also casts lights on electricity and uranium price effects on uranium demand {{as well as on the}} simultaneous interdependencies that may exist between nuclear consumption and <b>nuclear</b> <b>installed</b> <b>capacity.</b> The model is estimated for three different time periods which takes into account the major events that have influenced the nuclear-uranium development, that is, that have constrained the growth rate of <b>nuclear</b> generating <b>capacity,</b> i. e. oil crisis and nuclear accidents. This permits to show if uranium market reaction is independent or it is correlated with specific events associated with each time periods. The model was estimated by using the 3 SLS method that correct for the presence of contemporaneously error terms correlation and for the existence of simultaneity bias in the model. Main results give evidence of significant correlation between uranium price and competing fossil fuel prices. They also point-out that uranium price is significantly correlated with the supply forces where supply is significantly dependent on gold prices. Moreover, results show that the electricity prices have a significant effect on the uranium demand only in the post- 1990 period, probably following the worldwide electricity prices increasing trend. Further, our estimations show that uranium demand is significantly correlated with uranium price only in the period of nuclear major expansion. As for the nuclear electric consumption and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>installed</b> <b>capacity,</b> results show that they are simultaneously correlated and that the uranium demand depends on both of them, but only for the pre- 1990 period. Interestingly, our results give evidence of low elasticities and inelastic reaction of independent model variables to exogenous variables fluctuations, except for the uranium price equation. Based on these results, some policy implications related to, first, the competitiveness of the uranium market and, second, to the supply-demand policy and the associated pricing mechanisms on the uranium market are discussed.

40|$|International {{organizations}} regularly produce global {{energy demand}} scenarios. To {{account for the}} increasing population and GDP trends, {{as well as to}} encompass evolving energy uses while satisfying constraints on greenhouse gas emissions, long-term <b>installed</b> <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacity</b> scenarios tend to be more ambitious, even after the Fukushima accident. Thus, the amounts of uranium or plutonium needed to deploy such capacities could be limiting factors. This study first considers light-water reactors (LWR, GEN III) using enriched uranium, like most of the current reactor technologies. It then examines the contribution of future fast reactors (FR, GEN IV) operating with an initial fissile load and then using depleted uranium and recycling their own plutonium. However, as plutonium is only available in limited quantity since it is only produced in nuclear reactors, the possibility of starting up these Generation IV reactors with a fissile load of enriched uranium is also explored. In one of our previous studies, the uranium consumption of a third-generation reactor like an EPR™ was compared with that of a fast reactor started up with enriched uranium (U 5 -FR). For a reactor lifespan of 60 [*]years, the U 5 -FR consumes three times less uranium than the EPR and represents a 60 % reduction in terms of separative work units (SWU), though its requirements are concentrated over {{the first few years of}} operation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relevance of U 5 -FRs in a nuclear fleet deployment configuration. Considering several power demand scenarios and assuming different finite quantities of available natural uranium, this paper examines what types of reactors must be deployed to meet the demand. The deployment of light-water reactors only is not sustainable in the long run. Generation IV reactors are therefore essential. Yet when started up with plutonium, the number of reactors that can be deployed is also limited. In a fleet deployment configuration, U 5 -FRs appear to provide the best solution for using uranium, even if the economic impact of this consumption during the first years of operation is significant...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{in every}} {{region of the}} globe, many {{countries}} have expressed a new or renewed interest in nuclear power. In the context of growing energy demands to fuel economic growth and development, climate change concerns, and volatile fossil fuel prices, as well as improved safety and performance records, some 60 countries are expressing interest in, considering, or actively planning for nuclear power. This comes after a gap of nearly 15 years, during which international markets, energy systems and strategic concerns have evolved. Countries introducing nuclear power now face different conditions than in the past, and are responding to them in new and creative ways. This annex explores these issues, with a specific focus on countries planning for a first nuclear power plant. However, countries planning expansion of existing nuclear power programmes, {{some of which have}} not built new reactors for more than a decade, may also share some of these issues. Agency projections reflect the interest being expressed. The latest low and high projections, from 2009, indicate a global increase in <b>installed</b> <b>nuclear</b> generation <b>capacity,</b> by 2030, of between 35 % and 120 %. Most of that new capacity will be built in countries that already have operating nuclear power plants.

40|$|In 2008, as {{a result}} of a joint Indo-US {{agreement}} on civil nuclear cooperation, India gained access to the Nuclear Suppliersâ Group, allowing it to access civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries despite not being party to the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Following this, in 2011 India announced ambitious plans to expand its <b>installed</b> <b>nuclear</b> power generation <b>capacity</b> to 63 Gigawatts (GW) (out of over 800 GW) by 2032 through civil nuclear trade. However, several years on, much of this envisaged trade and investment has yet to come to fruition. Nuclear power remains on the agenda; Indiaâs new government (elected in May 2014) urged the Department of Atomic Energy to triple <b>nuclear</b> power generation <b>capacity</b> from the current 5. 7 GW (out of a total installed capacity of over 200 GW) to 17 GW by 2024. In the longer term, Indiaâs Atomic Energy Commission expects a far more ambitious 500 GW of <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacity</b> to be in place by 2060. However, the quantum of domestic and foreign investments required to achieve these targets has remained elusive. This has largely been put down to the passage into law of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (âthe Actâ). The Act, which sets up a specialized compensation mechanism for victims of nuclear incidents, contains provisions arguably inconsistent with Indiaâs international obligations. Additionally, it has been held to be excessively onerous on the suppliers of nuclear equipment and materials. Two specific provisions are particularly contentious: Section 17 (b) which holds suppliers liable for recourse when a nuclear incident results from either a patent or a latent defect in the equipment or material supplied, or {{as a result}} of the supply of substandard services; and Section 46 which arguably allows suppliers to remain liable under regular provisions of tort law and other general legislation despite having fulfilled their liabilities under this Act. This article explores these two issues and argues for a legislative re-alignment that ensures nuclear safety while incentivizing participation in the nuclear industry. Though several other issues are relevant for operationalizing the Act, specifically the establishment of the India Nuclear Insurance Pool, recently announced by the Government of India for insuring operator and supplier liability, they are incidental to the core legal concerns that currently impair the growth of nuclear energy in India, and are consequently not dealt with in this article. </p...|$|R
