In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as [...] "a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded [...] "enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily" [...] because its supporters no longer understood [...] "what the party stands for". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its [...] "socialist principles".|$|E

Paul Hutcheon noted in the 9 November edition of the Sunday Herald that Labour had [...] "consistently declined" [...] to confirm the number of its members in Scotland, but quoted an [...] "informed source" [...] suggesting the figure was slightly short of 13,500. However, Peter Jones of The Scotsman subsequently quoted a less favourable figure of fewer than 10,000, with [...] "most of the existing constituency membership [...] the relatives and friends of councillors/MSPs/MPs [...] would not welcome ... an influx of new members who might try to oust second-rate post-holders in favour of somebody new and better".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, he {{made the}} {{modestly}} successful Kingdom of Heaven, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven (which he blamed on paying {{too much attention to}} the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven has been met with critical acclaim, with Empire magazine calling the film an [...] "epic", adding: [...] "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle." [...] "This is the one that should have gone out" [...] reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: [...] "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> then you need to preview.

2500|$|Madjo joined Crawley Town on 28 June 2007, signing {{alongside}} Jon-Paul Pittman and Tyrone Thompson. He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4–1 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5–3 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively. Madjo had scored 11 goals in 18 games, which prompted speculation regarding a move into the Football League. Madjo said [...] "It is nice to have people say good things about you but at the moment I'm not thinking about other clubs. All I think about is <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> and doing my best for Crawley". On 21 November 2007, four days after earning a call up to the Cameroon squad, Madjo joined League One side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move. On Madjo's departure, Crawley Town manager Steve Evans said [...] "As a manager, I'm extremely disappointed. As a club, we always knew this day would come. He's an exceptional talent and a model professional". Madjo made his Cheltenham debut on 25 November 2007, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in Cheltenham's [...] "shock" [...] 1–0 home victory over Leeds United. He started his first game three weeks later, a 1–0 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal – [...] "Madjo had done nothing but impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher".|$|E

The one thing before all others that {{they want to do is}} to bring me down off my moral high horse. And I loathe the high horse. I am in a position of special moral superiority to men who are on the whole as good men as I am or better. That shows all the time. You see the sort of man I am. I've a broad streak of personal vanity. I fag easily. I'm short-tempered. I've other things, as you perceive. When I fag I become obtuse, I repeat and bore, I get viciously ill-tempered, I suffer from an intolerable sense of ill usage. Then that ass, Wagstaffe, who ought to be working with me steadily, sees his chance to be pleasantly witty. He gets a laugh round the table at my expense. Young Dent, the more intelligent of the labour men, reads me a lecture in committee manners. Old Cassidy sees HIS opening and jabs some ridiculous petty accusation at me and gets me spluttering self-defence like a fool. All my stock goes down, and as my stock goes down the chances of a good report dwindle. Young Dent grieves to see me injuring my own case. Too damned a fool to see what will happen to the report! You see if only they can convince themselves I am just a prig and an egotist and an impractical bore, they escape from a great deal more than my poor propositions. They escape from the doubt in themselves. By dismissing me they dismiss their own consciences. And then they can scamper off and be sensible little piggy-wigs and not bother any more about what is to happen to mankind in the long run....
