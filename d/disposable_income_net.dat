40|$|While the {{developed}} countries witnessed a significant contraction in credit consumption {{in response to the}} financial crisis in 2008, South Africa’s household debt continues to be on the increase. This article is based on empirical research on the relationship between household debt and <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> wealth, interest rates and inflation for the period between 1975 and 2013. Using regression analyses, the study examines the linkage between household debt and consumption spending in South Africa to capture the short-run and long-run dynamics. The results show that there is a significant relationship between household debt and <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> wealth and inflation. Further tests indicate that there is a bidirectional causality running from economic growth to household debt and vice versa. However, it is revealed that there is no direct relationship between household debt and lending rates...|$|E

The focus is on a measure of net income. Sometimes also referred to as <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> income refers to total money income from the labour market, cash benefits and tax credits including the state retirement pension, savings and investment income including private and occupational pensions, and private transfers, from which is deducted income tax payments, employee national insurance and occupational pension contributions, and local tax payments. (Gross income equals total income prior to the deductions referred to.) The household income variable provided in the official release of BHPS data is a gross income measure. However it is widely agreed that analysis of the personal distribution of income, inequality and poverty – trends over time and longitudinal dynamics – should use net income rather than gross income measures. ISER researchers have derived net income measures using BHPS data and, on an ad hoc basis, made these available as unofficial supplements to the main BHPS release files. BHPS net income variables are widely used. They also form part of the BHPS component of the Cross-National Equivalent File. (The CNEF contains comparable household panel dat...|$|E

Actual analysis are based on previous considerations about the origins and dynamics of income disparities in the Czech republic, about the method used to definethe group of respondents, the characteristics of a file with an emphasis on the income variable, the share of social transfers in disposable income, indicators of inequality and poverty assessment of vulnerable households. The primary data sourceare the survey results European Union – Statistics onIncome and Living Conditions in 2005 and 2008. This investigation has become obligatory for the Czech Republic after joining the European Union since 2005. The investigation provides long-term comparative data on income and social situation of households. According to common methodology applied within other EU countries results are compare even between EU member states. To achieve the objectives there will be used following methods: descriptive statistics on the characteristics of income (disposable income of households, the share of social transfers in household <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> cash income of households, average income, revenue deficits).

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} Ricardian Equivalence Concept by {{constructing}} “Ricardian ” time {{series for the}} incomes of U. S.

30|$|Urban-rural {{income gap}} (Gap): According {{to the current}} literature, the urban and rural income in {{national}} or provincial and municipal levels should be represented with the ratio of per capital <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> in urban and per capita <b>net</b> <b>income</b> in rural. However, the county-level data used in this paper is from “China Statistical Yearbook for Regional Economy” (2001 – 2008). This yearbook only covers the average wage income of workers in urban residents and residents’ per capita <b>net</b> <b>income.</b> Although replacing the urban <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> level with the wage income would be an overestimation, this paper studies the changing trend of income gap between urban and rural areas. The changing trend of <b>income</b> levels and <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> levels is the same. Although there are deviations, it still illustrates the problem, which has some credibility to a certain extent. Moreover, {{in comparison with the}} ratio of average income in provincial town on-the-job workers and the <b>net</b> <b>income</b> in rural residents and the ratio of per capital <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> in provincial urban residents and the <b>net</b> <b>income</b> in rural residents, we find that the correlation coefficient is 0.8226, which is significant at 1 % level.

40|$|We {{document}} a clear {{increase in}} Swedish earnings inequality {{in the early}} 1990 s, and that much of this increase was generated by movements {{in and out of}} the labor market. Inequality in <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and earnings <b>net</b> of taxes and transfers also increased, but much less than the increased inequality in pre-government earnings. These di¤er-ent developments are most likely explained by the generous Swedish welfare system. Consistent with these observations, we see no clear trend in consumption inequality. We also estimate stochastic processes for household earnings. A simple random-walk process captures much of the life-cycle dynamics. But we 8 ̆ 5 nd clear evidence that the true earnings process is not a random walk. We demonstrate that some estimation methods result in severe upward bias in the estimated volatility of permanent shocks if serial correlation in temporary shocks is ignored.

Moreover, this increase was mostly generated by an increased volatility of persistent shocks...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of a city {{populated}} by heterogeneous agents. Agents self-select into entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurs set up firms which hire workers. We characterize the equilibrium matching between firms and workers, as well as the within-city assignment of agents to locations. We then explore the implications of city size and the characteristics of the underlying skill distribution for selection into entrepreneurship, rent gradients, and city-wide inequality in <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes.</b> Agents self-select into occupations based on their earnings, we assume that highly productive agents have a comparative advantage in entrepreneurship, so that there exists some endogenously determined unique cutoff that separates workers from entrepreneurs. Workers are hired by entrepreneurs and are paid a match-specific wage, whereas entrepreneurs are the residual claimants to their firms' profits. All agents live in a linear city that stretches out on the finite interval. Both workers and entrepreneurs commute to the central business district (CBD) for work. Commuting entails costs, which we model parimoniously using an 'iceberg' specification. In our model, agents differ by income. A commuting costs are paid as a fraction of income, it follows that richer agents will want to locate closer to the CBD to minimize their costs. We thus have to find the spatial distribution of agents in the city- the mapping of agent's talent to city locations, such that every agent picks his preferred location. We look at the case with a fixed lot size assumption: maximizing utility is equivalent to maximizing <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> - <b>income</b> <b>net</b> of land rent and commuting costs. First, we will derive the comparative statics of the equilibrium variables with respect to exogenous parameters of the model like total population, commuting costs, and various moments of the talent distribution of the population. We expect that reducing commuting costs will lead to an increase in the density in a city, and that it will increase the share of entrepreneurs in the city. A larger share of entrepreneurs leads to tougher selection, which should magnify income inequality in the city. We have no a'priori intuition for the direction of change in "real" income inequality. Furthermore, a distribution of talent that is more skewed towards highly talented workers should increase the steepness of the rent gradient towards the city center. The reason is that more productive agents live closer to the center and compete for land there, and that a larger mass of highly talented agents will increase competition for land towards the center. Depending on how fast land prices go up for the rich compared to land prices for the poor, "real" income inequality may a'priori rise or fall as the distribution of talent gets more unequal within the city...|$|R

This paper presents estimates of housing stress for Statistical Local Areas (SLA) in Victoria, Queensland and the ACT in 2005.
