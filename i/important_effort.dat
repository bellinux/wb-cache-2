500|$|Under communism, Agârbiceanu's lay {{work began}} to be fully {{recovered}} in the late 1960s. An <b>important</b> <b>effort</b> in this process was undertaken by literary historian Mircea Zaciu, who had begun a critical re-evaluation as early as 1955, with a short monograph that took up George Călinescu's observation whereby Agârbiceanu was not a moralizer but an artistic narrator of moral situations. Zaciu went further, seeking to detach the Sămănătorist label and place him {{within the framework of}} ethical Transylvanian prose. His work, re-edited and amplified in 1964 and 1972, revived interest in the writer by precisely cataloguing his corpus and opening new directions for its critical analysis. The recovery was limited: according to Voncu, the arrival of national communism left critics unsure about whether to reintroduce Agârbiceanu's [...] "uncompromising vision of rural life" [...] into the literary canon.|$|E

Claiming that France was the country making the most <b>important</b> <b>effort</b> concerning development aid, he announced that the least developed countries (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of Third World debt during the 1980s).

Then a midseason blockbuster deal with the Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise. The Ducks sent Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third round pick to the Jets in return for Marc Chouinard, a fourth round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne.

6000|$|With {{the name}} of Richard Doyle {{we come to the}} first of a group of artists whose main work was, or is still, done for the time-honoured {{miscellany}} of Mr. Punch. So familiar an object is [...] "Punch" [...] upon our tables, that one is sometimes apt to forget how unfailing, and how good on the whole, is the work we take so complacently as a matter of course. And of this good work, in the earlier days, a large proportion was done by Mr. Doyle. He is still living, although he has long ceased to gladden those sprightly pages. But it was to [...] "Punch" [...] that he contributed his masterpiece, the [...] "Manners and Customs of ye Englyshe," [...] a series of outlines illustrating social life in 1849, and cleverly commented by a shadowy [...] "Mr. Pips," [...] a sort of fetch or double of the bustling and garrulous old Caroline diarist. In these captivating pictures the life of thirty years ago is indeed, as the title-page has it, [...] "drawn from ye quick." [...] We see the Molesworths and Cantilupes of the day parading the Park; we watch Brougham fretting at a hearing in the Lords, or Peel holding forth to the Commons (where the Irish members are already obstructive); we squeeze in at the Haymarket to listen to Jenny Lind, or we run down the river to Greenwich Fair, and visit [...] "Mr. Richardson, his show." [...] Many years after, in the [...] "Bird's Eye Views of Society," [...] which appeared in the early numbers of the [...] "Cornhill Magazine," [...] Mr. Doyle returned to this attractive theme. But the later designs were more elaborate, and not equally fortunate. They bear the same relationship to Mr. Pips's pictorial chronicle, as the laboured [...] "Temperance Fairy Tales" [...] of Cruikshank's old age bear to the little-worked Grimm's [...] "Goblins" [...] of his youth. So hazardous is the attempt to repeat an old success! Nevertheless, many of the initial letters to the [...] "Bird's Eye Views" [...] are in the artist's best and most frolicsome manner. [...] "The Foreign Tour of Brown, Jones, and Robinson" [...] is another of his happy thoughts for [...] "Punch;" [...] and some of his most popular designs {{are to be found in}} Thackeray's [...] "Newcomes," [...] where his satire and fancy seem thoroughly suited to his text. He has also illustrated Locker's well-known [...] "London Lyrics," [...] Ruskin's [...] "King of the Golden River," [...] and Hughes's [...] "Scouring of the White Horse," [...] from which last the initial at the beginning of this chapter has been borrowed.
