50|$|The enzymes {{used in the}} {{liquefaction}} step {{are usually}} alpha-amylases derived from bacterial or fungal bioreactors (Bacillus species or Aspergillus species are {{the most commonly used}} microbe engines in the bioreactors). These convert starch into dextrins of various molecular sizes and the modified starch end product is usually given an appropriate DE (Dextrose Equivalent) rating to signify the degree of starch conversion and the amount of reducing sugars produced in the process. The enzymes used in the saccharification step are the amylolytic enzyme, beta-amylase (usually derived from Bacillus species) and the debranching enzyme, pullulanase (derived from Aerobacter species). These convert the <b>dextrinised</b> <b>starch</b> into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and lower molecular weight dextrins.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 125 -kDa starch hydrolysing enzyme of Aspergillus niger characterised by {{its ability}} to <b>dextrinise</b> and saccharify <b>starch</b> [Suresh et al. (1999) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 51, 673 – 675] was also found to possess {{activity}} towards raw starch. Segregation of these activities in the 71 -kDa glucoamylase and a 53 -kDa α-amylase-like enzyme supported by antibody cross-reactivity studies and the isolation of mutants based on assay screens for the secretion of particular enzyme forms revealed the 125 -kDa starch hydrolysing enzyme as their precursor. N-terminal sequence analysis further revealed that the 71 -kDa glucoamylase was the N-terminal product of the precursor enzyme. Immunological cross reactivity of the 53 -kDa amylase with antibodies raised against the precursor enzyme {{but not with the}} 71 - and 61 -kDa glucoamylase antibodies suggested that this enzyme activity is represented by the C-terminal fragment of the precursor. The N-terminal sequence of the 53 -kDa protein showed similarity to the reported Taka amylase of Aspergillus oryzae. Antibody cross-reactivity to a 10 -kDa non-enzymic peptide and a 61 -kDa glucoamylase described these proteins as products of the 71 -kDa glucoamylase. Identification of only the precursor starch hydrolysing enzyme in the protein extracts of fungal protoplasts suggested proteolytic processing in the cellular periplasmic space as the cause for the secretion of multiple forms of amylases by A. niger...|$|R
