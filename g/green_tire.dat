50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the <b>green</b> <b>tire</b> in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the <b>green</b> <b>tire</b> is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the <b>green</b> <b>tire,</b> and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the <b>green</b> <b>tire</b> flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{the fabric}} was built up {{on a flat}} steel drum, with the cords at angles of about +60 and ‚àí60 degrees from the {{direction}} of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called cross ply or bias ply tires. The plies were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The <b>green</b> (uncured) <b>tire</b> was loaded over a curing bladder and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the heat buildup in the tire.|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} the global concern for fossil fuel consumption, automotive industry moves toward more efficient vehicles. Tires are {{of great importance}} in this respect, as the tire compound material {{in contact with the}} road surface and under the cyclic deformation dissipates energy due to its viscoelastic nature. On the other hand the friction between the road and the tire surface is required for a safe drive. These two contrary characteristics of the tire need a compromise to deliver a secure and efficient ride. Regarding the environmental issues, since July 1 st, 2012, all the tire manufacturers in Europe are obliged to provide an efficiency label for their tires indicating three characteristics which includes fuel efficiency (related to Rolling Resistance (RR) performance) and safety (related to Wet Skid (WS) performance). Present thesis deals with these two important aspects of the tire; RR and WS, investigating on a <b>green</b> <b>tire</b> tread material. Loss factor (tanŒ¥) is a determining parameter in analyzing the tire tread material performance. It has been accepted that the tanŒ¥ value of a tread compound measured at a temperature around 60 ¬∞C and a frequency of 10 Hz can be representative of the Rolling Resistance performance of a tire made thereof. However for Wet Skid performance the situation is a bit different. In order to predict Wet Skid, the viscoelastic properties of the rubber materials at high frequencies, in the megahertz (MHz) range, should be measured which is not feasible with the current laboratory facilities. Nonetheless Viscoelastic master curves derived from time-temperature superposition (TTS) can be used to describe the properties of the tread materials over a wide frequency range. Part of this thesis deals with different dynamic mechanical measuring methods and the analysis afterwards to receive a reliable viscoelastic mastercurve and defines the interpretations of the results. With the introduction of silica technology in passenger car tire tread applications, the filler-polymer interactions have become of key importance. Besides the silane coupling agents and control of the silanization process, a polymer functionality can play an essential role in the polymer-filler interactions. The aim is to reduce the hydrophobic characteristics of the hydrocarbon polymers and make them more compatible with hydrophilic silica, thereby giving better silica dispersion and better polymer-filler interactions. Second part of the thesis deals with employing the new generation of Styrene-Butadiene Rubbers which are functionalized either in the backbone or at the chain-end. The dynamic mechanical measurements on the tread compounds made from these rubbers reveal the significant potential of these modified SBRs to reduce RR of tire treads made thereof, while no major change in WS occurs...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between tires and roads are basic mechanisms that alter the dynamic states of vehicles. A fundamental understanding of tire-road interactions is clearly demanded in tire design to achieve performance improvements. The emergence of various tire sensors {{provides an opportunity}} to make accurate measurement of the physical quantities that are involved in tire-road interactions. ¬† This thesis aims to measure and analyze the in-plane deformation of rolling tires through its direct correlations with the steady-state in-plane tire forces. To date, there is no existing tire sensor that can measure both the tread and carcass deformations. A multi-laser sensor system has therefor been developed in the thesis to measure the in-plane deformation of different tire parts, including the tread, carcass, and inner liner. ¬†Measurements on tread deformation were conducted on both passenger car and truck tires. A non-uniform tread deformation was observed in the measurement and was interpreted as follows: the asymmetric deformation in the longitudinal direction is a direct indicator of the rolling resistance and the non-uniform deformation in the lateral direction reflects the contribution of separate parts to the rolling resistance. The evolution and variation of tread deformations were investigated with different tire types, operational conditions, and tire states. The deformation of the carcass was first analyzed with the flexible ring tire model and then validated through tire sensor measurements. Coupled deformations of the tire carcass in the tangential and radial directions were observed. Indicators based on measured radial carcass deformations are proposed for the estimation of the in-plane tire forces. In addition, the partial inner contours were also measured for truck tires under static conditions for various inflation pressures and loads. The measurements can help tire designers to obtain optimum inner tire contours. ¬†In summary, this thesis shows that the tire sensor can act as a powerful tool for tire research and development. The relations between the in-plane deformation and in-plane tire forces that have been obtained are useful in gaining an understanding of the physical mechanism of observed phenomena, e. g., the rolling resistance, and in the design of basic estimation algorithms, e. g., for the estimation of in-plane tire forces, which are important factors in the development of <b>green</b> and intelligent <b>tires...</b>|$|R
