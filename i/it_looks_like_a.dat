5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1950s {{the cult}} of Kataragama has taken a nationalistic tone amongst the Sinhalese people. People visit the shrine year long, and during the annual festival <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> carnival. People get into trance and indulge in ecstatic rituals {{formerly}} associated with Hindus such as fire walking, Kavadi and even body piercing or hook swinging. These ecstatic rituals have carried through the island and are widely practiced. Prominent Sinhalese politicians such as Dudley Senanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa have associated with the temple upkeep by building, renovation and cleaning projects.|$|E

25|$|The Chamber of Columns is {{a unique}} feature {{in the world of}} caves. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wide passage leaving the Web before {{sweeping}} back to the river about 100 m downstream. The passage circumnavigates a cluster of thick columns densely packed in the centre of chamber. The Railway Tunnel and Molossadie Passage enter the chamber from the north.|$|E
25|$|Jaceron or Pearl purl {{is similar}} to buillion, but with a much wider piece of metal which has been shaped (rounded) prior to purling it, such that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> string of pearl-like beads when couched down between the wraps of metal. Lizerine is a similar thread that has a flat {{appearance}} having not been shaped prior to purling.|$|E

25|$|Pillar Rock {{is a large}} {{rocky outcrop}} {{surrounded}} by cliffs on the northern side of Pillar, well below the summit. When seen from Ennerdale <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tall and thin column, hence its name. In the early 19th century it became widely {{known as one of}} the wonders of the Lake District, chiefly due to its featuring in William Wordsworth's poem The Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Female granary: storage {{place for}} a woman's things, her husband has no access. Building with a pointed roof. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> male granary but is less {{protected}} against mice. Here, she stores her personal belongings such as clothes, jewelry, money and some food. A woman has a degree of economic independence, and earnings and things related to her merchandise are stored in her personal granary. She can for example make cotton or pottery. The number of female granaries is an indication {{for the number of}} women living in the guinna.|$|E

25|$|One {{can imagine}} a stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time.

25|$|A {{great deal}} of care has gone into the {{construction}} of the Kashivisvanatha Temple in Lakkundi, which deifies Shiva. This temple has a unique feature: a small Surya (Sun) shrine faces the main shrine on the west. There is a common platform between both, which must have been an open mandapa originally. Hence, the Kashivisvanatha Temple has an entrance on the east side and south side of the mandapa. The entrance doorway and the towers are covered with close intricate carvings. The shikhara (dome) is in the North-Indian style and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lathe must have been used to make the complex circular pillars.|$|E

As <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wedding will take place and that Serena is the one who is getting married, Blair and Georgina tell the truth about who Serena is, ruining the wedding of two men; Serena was only a maid of honor. Blair apologizes to Serena for the mean words she said to her months ago but she responds that she wants a fresh start with Steven.|$|E

25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E

Several reports from before the withdrawal did refer to the city as [...] "ruined" [...] and [...] "shell-scarred". The Times correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being [...] "in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wild west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction. Nearly every building is heavily damaged and scores have collapsed." ...|$|E
500|$|The Syrian {{geographer}} al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as [...] "so rich {{in trees}} <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cloth of brocade spread out upon the land". He accounted to Gaza {{the cities and}} towns of Ascalon, Jaffa, Caesarea, Arsuf, Deir al-Balah, al-Arish (in north-central the Sinai), Bayt Jibrin, Karatiyya, Hebron and Jerusalem—all of which had their own sub-governors. Emir Baibars al-Ala'i ruled Mamlakat Ghazzah between 1307-1310, during the second reign of an-Nasir Muhammad until the latter was briefly overthrown by Baybars al-Jashnakir. Gaza {{was one of the}} places that returned to the allegiance of the exiled sultan; in 1310, an-Nasir Muhammad defeated Sultan Baybars in Gaza, forcing the latter to surrender his throne to him. Baybars was imprisoned in the city.|$|E
500|$|The second segment, [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet", {{was written}} by Oakley and Weinstein. It was {{inspired}} by an episode of The Twilight Zone called [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", in which William Shatner's character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions. Oakley {{said there was a}} lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet" [...] to make him scary [...] "within The Simpsons universe". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and [...] "yet <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> completely organic Simpsons character". Üter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was [...] "such a perfect stereotype".|$|E

But critics thought had Roden used 35mm instead of a digital camera, it could've been something else rather than making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second rate copycat of Blairwitch, which failed to have extensive screenings and international distribution.|$|R
