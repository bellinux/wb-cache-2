25|$|A {{classical}} type {{of error}} correction coding used with OFDM-based systems is convolutional coding, often concatenated with Reed-Solomon coding. Usually, additional interleaving (on {{top of the}} time and frequency interleaving mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for Reed-Solomon coding as the outer <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>code</b> is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and Reed-Solomon codes are inherently well-suited to correcting bursts of errors.|$|E

40|$|Recently, network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding</b> (NEC) {{has been}} studied extensively. Several bounds in {{classical}} coding theory have been extended to network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding,</b> especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed in zhang-correction, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this bound and indicate that the required field size {{for the existence of}} network maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>codes</b> including the linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> MDS <b>codes.</b> Finally, we study the <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> capability of random linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding.</b> Motivated partly by the performance analysis of random linear network coding Ho-etc-random, we evaluate the different failure probabilities defined in this paper in order to analyze the performance of random linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding.</b> Several upper bounds on these probabilities are obtained and they show that these probabilities will approach to zero as the size of the base field goes to infinity. Using these upper bounds, we slightly improve on the probability mass function of the minimum distance of random linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>codes</b> in zhang-random, as well as the upper bound on the field size required for the existence of linear network <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>codes</b> with degradation at most d.

50|$|In {{order to}} ensure at least k keys must be {{compromised}} before every shared key can be computed by an attacker, identifiers must be k-linearly independent: all sets of k randomly selected user identifiers must be linearly independent. Otherwise, a group of malicious users can compute the key of any other member whose identifier is linearly dependent to theirs. To ensure this property, the identifiers shall be preferably chosen from a MDS-Code matrix (maximum distance separable <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>code</b> matrix). The rows of the MDS-Matrix would be the identifiers of the users. A MDS-Code matrix can be chosen in practice using the code-matrix of the Reed-Solomon <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>code</b> (this <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>code</b> requires only easily understandable mathematics and can be computed extremely quickly).|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} quantum <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> was {{established}} {{more than a}} decade ago as the primary tool for fighting decoherence in quantum information processing.

The three alternative systems are all non-TCM systems and consist of QPSK with independent r= 1 / 2 <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding</b> on the in-phase and quadrature components, 8 -ary biorthogonal keying (8 -BOK) with r= 2 / 3 <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding,</b> and 16 -BOK with r= 3 / 4 <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>coding.</b> The effects of both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and pulse-noise interference (PNI) are considered. The TCM system shows much better than expected performance and significant resistance to PNI, and performance improves as the number of memory element increases. The alternative QPSK system with soft decision decoding (SDD) experiences significant degradation with PNI. The 8 -BOK with r= 2 / 3 <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> and 16 -BOK with r= 3 / 4 <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> systems occupy approximately the same bandwidth as the TCM system and show better performance in PNI than the alternative QPSK system...|$|R
