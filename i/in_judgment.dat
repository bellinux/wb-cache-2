5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow <b>in</b> <b>judgment,</b> with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E

5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat <b>in</b> <b>judgment</b> on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E

40|$|Listening {{has been}} {{reported}} to be an important component <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> of communication competence in the workplace. To investigate the contributions of listening to judgments of competence, this study examined how organization members use listening and listening-related factors <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> of communica-tion competence across situations. The results support the notion that listening plays a central role in assessments of communication competence. Analysis reveals that listening accounts for approximately one-third of the characteristics perceivers use to evaluate communication competence in co-workers. Addition-ally, the results suggest organization members differ in their use of listening <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> of competence <b>in</b> several kinds of situations. Scholars from a variety of disciplines have claimed that communica-tion competence is central to effective functioning in organization...|$|R
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Dover, Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14, 1532. She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, {{there was a second}} wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began to move at a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat <b>in</b> <b>judgment</b> at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the duke of Suffolk's murder, Beaumont had been an {{associate}} of the by now recalcitrant Richard, duke of York, having been one of the duke's feoffees in May 1436 and March 1441, and possibly even acting as the duke's councillor on occasion. He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first Protectorate (March 1453 â€“ January 1454). But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the first battle of St Albans in 1455, he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's stand-off with king at Dartford in 1452, and then sat <b>in</b> <b>judgment</b> on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a Neville, her family had by now aligned themselves with the duke of York. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454. He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the duke of Somerset after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one. Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate. He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454. He {{was one of the few}} Lords Temporal to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward. He was also part of the royal commission set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure; the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young Prince of Wales, which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.|$|E

40|$|This study extends prior {{research}} on accounting judgment {{and decision making}} research by examining the effects of â€˜newâ€™ and â€˜complexâ€™ accounting standards on judgments of professional accountants. It examines {{whether there are differences}} <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> of professional accountants in Fiji when interpreting and applying selected International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). A significant within-country difference <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> of professional accountants has serious implications for convergence of accounting standards. The results show that interpretation and application of accounting standards are affected by complexity of the accounting standard and professional accountant's familiarity with the standard. The study also finds strong support for an interactive effect of familiarity with the accounting standards and complexity in accounting standards on judgments of professional accountants. Furthermore, the results show that differences <b>in</b> <b>judgments</b> exist between the Big 4 and non-Big 4 professional accountants when provided with new accounting standards that require complex judgments. The results of this study are of interest to stakeholders at a time when IFRSs are increasingly being adopted throughout the world and standard setters are struggling to promote compliance with those standards. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{theoretical}} framework for case studies about teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching. Through consideration of studies on teachers'moral perception, teachers'teaching style, and teachers'pedagogical judgment, the following three points were abstracted as important viewpoints to grasp teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching. The first one is to focus on teachers'teaching style which is consistently presented in various expressions in teaching. The second is to focus on both of <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> a one-time-only situation and the teaching style as a formed habit. The third is to grasp characteristics of teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> one phase of teaching in such three temporal contexts, as 1) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the teaching, 2) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the development of the class and children since April, and 3) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teachers'teaching career. In conclusion, this paper suggests that in order to explore teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching, case studies should be conducted with the theoretical framework in this paper...|$|R
