40|$|The {{toxicity}} of Salmonella typhosa 0901 W endotoxin to mice was potentiated by (per kilogram) 1 mg of colchicine, 20 mg of emetine, 100 mg of 6 -mercaptopurine, 100 mg of 6 -methylmercaptopurine riboside, 75 mg of methotrexate, 2 mg of sparsomycin, or 2. 5 mg of vinblastine. No potentiation of endotoxin lethality was evident with simultaneously administered (per kilogram) : 200 mg of cytosine arabinoside, 450 mg of <b>dibromomannitol,</b> 100 mg of 5 -fluorouracil, 125 mg of 5 -fluorouracil deoxyriboside, 8 mg of mitomycin C, 1 mg of nitrogen mustard, or 10 mg of tris(1 -aziridinyl) -phosphine sulfide. With {{the exception of}} colchicine, all drugs prolonged the duration of sleep after the administration of 80 mg of hexobarbital per kg. Simultaneous injection of endotoxin with 100 mg of 6 -mercaptopurine per kg, 75 mg of methotrexate per kg, or 1 mg of vincristine per kg resulted in significantly greater lethality than administration either prior to or after the drug. However when endotoxin was administered prior to 100 mg of 5 -fluorouracil per kg, lethality was significantly increased. The route of administration of endotoxin and 5 -fluorouracil, 6 -mercaptopurine, methotrexate, or vincristine did not influence overall lethality. Pretreatment of mice with multiple doses of Escherichia coli endotoxin resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} the lethality of 6 -mercaptopurine- or vincristine-endotoxin combinations, but had no influence on 5 -fluorouracil- or methotrexate-endotoxin combinations. Endotoxin-pretreated mice were more susceptible to vincristine alone and more resistant to high doses of 5 -fluorouracil. The lethality of 6 -mercaptopurine was increased by simultaneous administration of gram-negative isolates from feces of human patients with neoplastic disease...|$|E
