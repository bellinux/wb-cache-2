Whenever a position is selected by cliclung the mouse on a page of the <b>document</b> <b>on</b> <b>display</b> on the screen, the corresponding location of the particular (LA) TEX source file {{is shown in the}} editor's buffer window, ready for inspection or for alteration. One may also compile and preview (and obviously edit as well) any part of the entire document, typically one of its constituent files, for efficiency's sake.

It is divided into two sections: (A) NIOSH-authored documents (which include numbered publications, testimony, journal articles, health hazard evaluations, and miscellaneous reports) and (B) NIOSH-funded documents (which include grant and contract reports). Each document citation includes the title and year of publication and bibliographic or ordering information (see below). Those documents listed in Part II that are reproduced in Part I are noted with the following statement: (Full [or partial] text included in Part L).

5000|$|There are {{inconsistencies}} {{about the}} true nature of the acquisition and the subsequent whereabouts of the Westcar Papyrus. Lepsius writes that the <b>document</b> was <b>on</b> <b>display</b> in the Oxford Bodleian Library, but public exhibitions have been documented there since the early 1860s and Lepsius' name does not appear in any lists or documents. Furthermore, Lepsius never made the text of the Westcar Papyrus public; he stored the papyrus at home in the attic, where it was found later after his death. These inconsistencies led to wide speculation; Many British historians speculate that Lepsius may have stolen the papyrus.|$|R

40|$|Tabletop {{computer}} displays {{suffer from}} an orientation problem. Solutions based on competing approaches have been implemented, but there remain unanswered {{questions about the}} ideal solution. Within a context of interacting with <b>documents</b> <b>on</b> tabletop <b>displays,</b> requirements for orientation control were found by examining literature on how people use paper documents and what manipulations they perform. It was determined that control must provide quick, either-handed, low-attention manipulation of individual objects <b>on</b> the <b>display.</b> An evaluation of existing interaction techniques for rotation was performed {{in light of these}} criteria. The trade-off between two desirable characteristics, integral translation and rotation, and direct input, was examined. An evaluation of mouse-based techniques confirmed that integral input {{has the potential to be}} faster than the established sequential-manipulation techniques due to the time saved by overlapping manipulation of different degrees of freedom. For a single task combining translation and rotation the separable technique took twice as long compared to two separate tasks of the same translation or rotation, whereas the integral techniques took less time for the combined action than the two separate actions. However, the integral mouse-based techniques were too slow in their actual manipulation, with the scroll wheel taking four times as long to rotate than the separable technique, and the new drag technique not being used in an integral manner. It was concluded that the current generally available technology such as the mouse and single-point touch-sensitive overlays are inadequate. Acceptable tabletop orientation control will be dependent on the maturation of newer technologies based on tangible interfaces or possibly multi-finger input. Until then, interaction techniques for manipulating <b>documents</b> <b>on</b> tabletop <b>displays</b> should be chosen according to their ability to concurrently control position and orientation, such as three degree-of-freedom input devices on digitizing tablets...|$|R

50|$|Catheryna Rombout Brett {{was born}} in New York, New York, baptized 25 May 1687. She was the {{daughter}} of Helena Teller Bogardus Van Ball Rombout and Francis Rombout. Helena Teller {{was the daughter of}} William Teller, of Albany, one of the original patent holders of the area around Schenectady. Francis Rombout {{was born in}} Hasselt in Limburg (today in Belgium) who emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1653. Rombout served as a lieutenant during Stuyvesants' expedition against New Sweden. In partnership with Gulyne Verplank, Rombout became a successful merchant-fur trader, and in 1679, Mayor of New York. In 1683, Rombout and Verplanck purchased about 85,000 acres from the Wappinger native Indians. The purchased was confirmed, 17 October 1685 by a royal patent issued by King James II to Francis Rombout, Jacobus Kipp (who married the widowed Henrica Verplank) and Stephanus Van Courtland. The original <b>document</b> is <b>on</b> <b>display</b> at the Homestead. Francis Rombout died in 1691 leaving his estate to his only surviving heir, Catharyna.|$|R
