500|$|It's happened. At last. I've hit the Holy Grail of {{animation}} gigs. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a character on ... tan-tara ... SpongeBob SquarePants. Oh Yeah!! We, the family, are thrilled. Nothing else need happen this year, well, this week anyway. My character {{in this special}} longform (I think a half hour special) show is called 'Lord Royal Highness'. Alrighteee!! ...|$|E
500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wild and crazy, and at the same time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E
500|$|She began {{performing}} at age six {{when she was}} cast in the lead singing role of [...] "Little Star" [...] in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents {{to tell them that}} their daughter was [...] "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, so <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour. She won a talent quest in her first year (Year 9) at Burnside High School, which she attended from 2000 to 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Peter Bogdanovich's ex-wife Polly Platt, a film editor, {{had read}} Hill's script for Hickey & Boggs and {{recommended}} him to co-write The Getaway, which Bogdanovich {{was going to}} make with Steve McQueen. Bogdanovich and Hill worked on the script together in San Francisco while Bogdanovich was directing What's Up, Doc? Hill says that Bogdanovich was interested in making the film a more Hitchcock-type movie. They had completed 25 pages when they went back to L.A., whereupon McQueen fired Bogdanovich without reading any of their work. Sam Peckinpah came on to direct; Hill started from scratch and wrote his own script in six weeks. The resulting movie was a big hit which Hill later described [...] "of the films I wrote, I thought it was far and away the best one, and most interesting." [...] He said the success of the film [...] "was really how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a director; the fact it had done so well put me in line to get a shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: [...] "I’ve {{always said}} that Chris was the {{greatest}} songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powers first appears {{publicly}} {{presenting the}} religion in February 1948 giving a talk in Los Angeles Bahá'í Center. That year he also publicly reflected on {{his career in}} law enforcement writing two articles for the Saturday Evening Post - a two part series Crime was my business. In it of his twenty five years in police work he said [...] "It's {{a long time to}} last without becoming a cynic" [...] and:During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E
