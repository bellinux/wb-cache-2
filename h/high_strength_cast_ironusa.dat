The present paper reviews the strengthening mechanisms, tensile properties and modification results of commercial <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>cast</b> Mg alloys; as well as the development of Mg-Gd, Mg-Nd and Mg-Sn based alloys. It concludes that precipitation strengthening is the most important strengthening mechanism in <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>cast</b> Mg alloys, which contributes more than 60 % of yield strength in solution & peak-aged (T 6) cast Mg alloys. For the yield strength, the alloys follow the sequence of Mg-Gd(Y) -Ag > Mg-Gd(Y) -Zn > Mg-Gd-Y/Sm/Nd > Mg-Y-Nd (WE series) > ZK 61 > Mg-Nd > AZ 91 > Mg-Sn. Mg-Gd(Y) -Ag based alloys are the strongest cast Mg alloys at present, followed by Mg-Gd(Y) -Zn based alloys.

40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held.

40|$|Although Very <b>High</b> <b>Strength</b> Steels (VHSS) with nominal {{strengths}} up to 1100 MPa {{have been}} available {{on the market for}} many years, the use of these steels in the civil engineering industry is still uncommon. The main objective of the research is the determination of the fatigue strength of welded connections made of VHSS. The research comprised of a literature study, an experimental study and an analysis of the results. An effective application of VHSS is expected in truss-like structures, typically made of hollow sections. Truss structures enable full exploitation of the <b>high</b> material <b>strength</b> of VHSS, because in such stiff structures the deflection is not the governing the design criterion. Improved design of VHSS truss structures should incorporate the application of very <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>cast</b> joints, as an appropriate design of cast joints limits the stress concentrations in the joint. The fatigue <b>strength</b> of <b>cast</b> joints will therefore be relatively high compared to that of regular steel welded joints, as the stress concentration of the connection is limited and welds are shifted out of critical zones. Three types of specimens were fatigue tested in the study: specimens of base material, of welded plates and of trusses made of circular hollow sections (CHS) and cast joints. Plate test specimens were derived from base material of rolled steel and welded cast and rolled plates. The main conclusion of the research is that <b>higher</b> yield <b>strength</b> increases crack initiation life of base material and welded connections in case of low notch stress concentration and small initial imperfections.

The materials considered are a <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> alloyed <b>cast</b> steel and a medium <b>strength</b> nodular <b>cast</b> iron. It is concluded that cast defects is the main fatigue initiation cause {{and it is only}} in exception that the fatigue life is not ruled by fracture mechanics. The third paper is a fracture mechanics evaluation of a nodular iron cast sleeve. The analysis of the component is based on crack initiation from cast defects and low-cycle fatigue. Fracture mechanics material parameters for Paris law, c and m, are extracted for the materials considered. In paper D design quality rules for nodular cast iron based on the Swedish standard SS 11 40 60 is presented. The quality rules regard cast defects in fatigue assessments and facilitate defect-based component design. In paper E, a finite element tool that is capable to predict and calculate 3 D crack propagation for embedded cracks and defects is presented. The tool is an add-on for ANSYS finite element program.

[...] In the experimental phase of this research a total of 150 specimens made of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> concrete were <b>cast</b> to investigate the bond strength under monotonic and cyclic loading. The influences of load history, confining reinforcement, rebar diameter, concrete strength, rebar spacing, rate of pull out, and deformation pattern were investigated experimentally for reinforcement bars of 25 mm and 35 mm diameter. The internal concrete strains close to the contact surface and also the steel rebar strains were measured. The test set up, load application, instrumentation and measurement, test procedure, and type of materials were designed to measure accurate strains and deformations. Several specimens with different rebar diameters and rib geometries were tested. The range of the tested concrete compressive strengths was between 75 MPa and 95 MPa. The rib geometries were examined for rebar with nominal diameter of 25 mm and 35 mm.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> ductile <b>cast</b> iron {{produced by}} a quenching and partitioning process (Q&P) is evaluated. The Q&P process is receiving increased attention as {{a new way to}} produce ultra-high strength steels with multiphase microstructures composed of a martensite matrix and substantial amounts of carbon-stabilized retained austenite. Currently, the mechanical properties arising from applying the Q&P process in ductile cast irons have not been investigated. Thermal treatments consisted of heating the material to 880 °C for a 2 hour soaking time followed by quenching in oil at 140 °C and 170 °C, intermediate temperatures between Ms and Mf allowing the formation of a controlled amount of athermal martensite. The material was reheated to 300 °C and 375 °C (the partition treatment) for different times between 15 and 120 minutes and subsequently air-cooled to room temperature. Microstructural evolution and carbon partitioning was investigated by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. With a microstructure composed of tempered martensite, bainitic ferrite and carbon-enriched stabilized austenite, a new class of properties was obtained, with an enhanced strength when compared to ADI (austempered ductile iron) while still maintaining reasonable elongation. Fatigue testing was undertaken using polished plain bend bars (no stress concentration features) assessed under four-point bending. Uninterrupted tests at varying loads show that the higher partitioning temperature is beneficial for fatigue life. Fracture initiation sites are primarily from pores and a number of decohered graphite nodules. A strong influence of the microstructure on subsequent fatigue crack growth is observed from interrupted testing with replica records and SEM examination of tested samples, with cracks exhibiting significant tortuosity, at times even appearing to grow approximately parallel to the tensile axis. Using these results, the effects of the Q&P treatment, particularly the role of the partitioning time and temperature, on the fatigue properties of ductile cast iron are assessed...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} in the {{previous}} decade that pure-iron has a large potential as a biodegradable medical implant material. It is necessary to tailor the material properties according to the intended use of the device. It is {{of great interest to}} investigate not only the influence of processing on the material properties but also alternative fabrication methods. In this work for the first time magnetron sputtering in combination with UV lithography was used to fabricate free standing, patterned pure-iron thick films. For the intended use as biodegradable implant material free standing thick films were characterized in terms of microstructure, degradation performance, and mechanical properties before and after various heat treatments. The influence of microstructural changes on the degradation behavior was determined by linear polarization measurements. The mechanical properties were characterized by tensile tests. Microstructure, surface, and composition were investigated by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The foils exhibited a preferential orientation in 110 direction and a fine grained structure. Furthermore they showed a <b>higher</b> <b>strength</b> compared to <b>cast</b> iron and corrosion rates in the range of 0. 1 mm/year. Their mechanical properties were tuned by grain coarsening resulting in a slight increase of the degradation rate...|$|R

The effect of texture on fatigue properties and short crack behavior were studied. The strengthening mechanisms were also thoroughly investigated for the two <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> alloys. Texture {{played an important role}} in the anisotropy of fatigue strength for the AA 5754 Al alloy. Being a solution strengthened alloy, it had a fatigue strength of 120 % σy. <b>High</b> <b>strength</b> Al alloys had a strong tendency for planar slip due to the high density of coherent and shearable precipitates in the alloys. Texture was a key factor controlling the crack initiation and propagation. The crack path and the possible minimum twist angles were measured using EBSD and calculated theoretically by a crystallographic model. Based on the micro-texture measured by EBSD, the crack paths were predicted for the AA 2099 alloy and confirmed by the observed values. The excellent balance of superior fatigue properties and <b>high</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of AA 2026 and AA 2099 was attributed to the reduced population of Fe-containing particles...|$|R
40|$|In Hong Kong, <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> {{concrete}} {{has been}} in use {{for several years and}} the <b>highest</b> <b>strength</b> concrete used in actual construction has already reached Grade 100.
