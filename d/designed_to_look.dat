5|$|After his career, McLaughlin {{allegedly}} {{worked in}} the counterfeit consumer goods industry in Mexico making knock-off athletic footwear, which included shoes <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like Converse, Vans, and Adidas. In 1990, {{he was arrested for}} trafficking the counterfeit shoes and money laundering. He pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, and proceeded to post bail. Before being sentenced, McLaughlin fled and his current whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E

5|$|The French TOURNESOL {{instrument}} {{consisted of}} four proportional counters and two optical detectors. The proportional counters detected photons between 2keV and 20MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors {{had a field}} of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse's mother, Luann Van Houten, {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in this episode. She was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> very similar to Milhouse. Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he got {{from one of his}} wife's friends.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5000|$|According to O'odham oral history, the {{labyrinth}} design depicts experiences and choices individuals {{make in the}} journey through life.

50|$|In 2013, Betabrand {{launched}} a crowdfunding platform, similar to Kickstarter, so that users can crowdsource clothing concepts and prototypes into actual products. Since {{the inception of}} the crowdfunding platform, Betabrand has funded almost 100 garments, including its 'Dress Pant Yoga Pants' (dual purpose <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like formal trousers) and an urban jacket modeled on space wear. A feature of production is the turnaround from initial <b>design</b> <b>to</b> sellable article - which can be in four to eight weeks. As of October, 2015, Betabrand carried more than 300 crowd-created products in its catalog.|$|R

5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> feeble, yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets are made {{to be dependent on}} their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.|$|E
5|$|Skopje has a {{bus network}} {{managed by the}} city and {{operated}} by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines. However, most of the network {{is still in the}} hands of JSP which operates 67 lines on 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP buses are (by Chinese buse builder Yutong) red double-decker buses <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like the British-made buses that were in use in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.|$|E

His Romans show a degree of {{abstraction}} from calligraphy not present {{in the work of}} the earlier master Nicolas Jenson, while his italic and Greek types are notably cursive. Philip B. Meggs wrote in A History of Graphic Design, [...] "Griffo research pre-Caroline scripts to produce a roman type that was less artistic but more authentic than Jenson's designs". The italic type was <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like handwriting of the humanist scholars. This more personal form of type became widely popular in Europe.|$|R
5|$|The {{classes of}} 1994, 1998, and 1999 at the University of Maryland, College Park, Henson's alma mater, {{commissioned}} a life-size statue of Henson and Kermit the Frog, which was dedicated on September 24, 2003, {{which would have}} been Henson's 67th birthday. The statue cost $217,000 and is displayed outside Maryland's student union. In 2006, Maryland introduced 50 statues of their school mascot, Testudo the Terrapin, with various designs chosen by different sponsoring groups.

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2009 after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{approached}} Obsidian {{about making a}} role-playing game <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> exactly like the television series. Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. The Stick of Truths production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, THQ, {{the rights to the}} game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
2500|$|... is a {{one-shot}} manga anthology by Misuzu Asaoka. Kadokawa Shoten originally published it in Japan on December 17, 2003 under the Asuka Comics label. Tokyopop released {{it in the}} United States on February 7, 2006. In 2005, they also released it in Germany under the title Der Prinz mit den gläsernen Schwingen (The Prince with Wings of Glass). Asaoka noted that she prefers her character <b>designs</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> both attractive and intelligent, and that she put more effort into developing some characters' faces than their bodies. Glass Wings has received several primarily negative reviews from Western critics.|$|R

60|$|AFTER THE very {{minute and}} {{elaborate}} paper by Arago, {{to say nothing}} of the summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen's discovery, I have any <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the subject in a scientific point of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second place, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in a general way, and speculatively, at the results of the discovery.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> largely the same as the original.|$|E

50|$|In 1919, Nell and Paul Donnelly {{established}} the Donnelly Garment Company. The company rapidly grew through the 1920s, becoming {{known for its}} focus on good fit and durability combined with attractive designs.

As Nell was a size 16, she wanted her <b>designs</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> stylish and flattering on women {{of a wide range of}} sizes. In 1927, Kansas City voted Nell its most illustrious businesswoman for her success in turning them into a successful center for ready-to-wear production.|$|R
5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks.

In 1962, they moved to Dodger Stadium, but only stayed there through 1965. They played two Opening Day games at Dodger Stadium, winning once and losing once. The Angels finally moved to Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 1966, which was first called Anaheim Stadium, then {{subsequently}} renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim later.

In Opening Day games on the road, their starting pitchers {{have a record of}} 10wins and 5losses with 5no decisions.|$|E
5|$|Devil Children {{was created}} as a {{response}} to the popularity of the Pokémon series of games, and as an alternative take on the game Shin Megami Tensei for younger players, featuring child characters and cute monsters.
