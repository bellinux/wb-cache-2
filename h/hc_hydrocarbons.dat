To this end, a numerical model was employed to simulate the operation cycle and characterize the exhaust gas composition. After a preliminary validation process was carried out using experimental data from a four-stroke, medium-speed marine engine, the numerical model was employed to study the influence of several internal modifications, such as water addition from 0 to 100 % water to fuel ratios, exhaust gas recirculation from 0 to 100 % EGR rates, modification of the overlap timing from 60 to 120 °, modification of the intake valve closing from 510 to 570 °, and modification of the cooling water temperature from 70 to 90 °C.

40|$|When {{emission}} standards for vehicles {{are becoming more}} stringent, catalysts that efficiently oxidize CO and <b>HC</b> (<b>hydrocarbons)</b> are a necessity. One of the important aspects here is to improve efficiency at low temperatures. This is emphasized by the change in technology towards more fuel-efficient engines which results in colder emissions {{and the need for}} reducing cold-start emissions [1]. Low-temperature oxidation can be enhanced using different strategies [2]. New materials and combinations of materials could be one solution and in that context the distribution of the active phase in the support material is crucial [3]. The distribution of the active phase will influence mass and heat transfer and thereby control the conversion of the reactants. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} heterogeneous distribution of the active phase (Pt) in the support material can improve the oxidation of CO at low temperatures [3]. The idea was that concentrate the active phase locally in the support material would result in a better utilization of generated reaction heat leading to higher temperatures of the active sites and, therefore, promote higher activity. The study showed an increase in activity for the samples with heterogeneous distribution of the active phase but it was also concluded that the enhancement in activity most likely arises from mass transfer effects...|$|E

Three n-pentanol fractions in the fuel mixture were selected: 10, 20 and 30 % by volume. Results show that, the addition of n-pentanol leads to longer ignition delay and increases the peak heat release rate in the premixed combustion phase. The brake specific fuel consumption increases with increase of n-pentanol, while the brake thermal efficiency is not affected. Regarding the gaseous emissions, n-pentanol addition results in the following consequence: (a) <b>HC</b> (<b>hydrocarbon)</b> and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions increase for 30 % n-pentanol in the blended fuel at low engine load but decrease at high engine load; (b) a slight increase (maximum 8 %) in NOx emissions but noticeable increase in NO 2 emissions.

40|$|This {{project is}} to {{determine}} the influence of ethanol fuel in engine emission. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasoline with the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasohol fuels which are ethanol 10 % (ethanol 10 % blended with gasoline 90 %), ethanol 85 % (ethanol 85 % blended with gasoline 15 %) and pure ethanol (ethanol 100 %). The engine model use in this project is build up according to Mitsubishi’s 4 G 92 which is use in Proton Wira. The simulation is conducted by using Gamma Technologies Software (GT-Power). The relation between the increasing of engine speed with the amount of emission and the amount of emission produced by each fuel is also discussed. Major finding shows that the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) decrease with the increase of blended ethanol in the fuel. Furthermore, although overall of the emission pattern results showed good agreement with previously published work even though the amount is different compare to the past studies but this is due to the engine parameters itself each engine have different parameter. The observation indicates that the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasoline is the highest compare to the other fuel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of EIVC (early inlet valve closure) on emissions, fuel economy and {{exhaust gas temperature}} of a turbocharged, 4 cylinder common rail direct injection diesel engine has been investigated and compared with the {{influence of}} deactivating two cylinders. IVC (inlet valve closing) timings were set at up to 60  CA (crank angle) degrees earlier than the production setting of 37 ° ABDC for the engine. At the earliest timing, effective compression ratio was reduced from 15. 2 : 1 to 13. 7 : 1. The effects on emissions were significant only for EIVC settings at least 40  CA degrees earlier than the production setting, and were sensitive to engine load. At 2  bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and fixed levels of NOx, soot emissions were reduced but CO (carbon monoxide) and <b>HC</b> (<b>hydrocarbon)</b> increased unless fuel rail pressure was reduced. With increasing load, soot reduction diminished and was negligible at 6  bar BMEP; CO and HC emissions deteriorated further. At all conditions, EIVC raised exhaust gas temperature by > 50  °C; the effect on fuel economy was negligible or a fuel economy penalty. Comparisons indicate cylinder deactivation is the more effective strategy for reducing engine-out emissions of HC and CO and raising exhaust gas temperature under light load operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fatty acid chain length, number of double bonds and alcohol moiety chain length on {{combustion}} and emission characteristics were investigated. With {{the increase of}} carbon chain length of methyl ester, <b>HC</b> (<b>hydrocarbon),</b> CO and smoke emissions increase. The particle number concentration of nucleation mode decrease and accumulation mode increases with carbon chain length. The diameter of primary particle increases with carbon chain length. The double bonds of methyl ester are strongly correlated with CO, HC, nucleation mode and accumulation mode particles. The BSFC of unsaturated methyl ester is slightly higher. With increase of alcohol moiety chain length, the start of combustion is advanced, leading to lower premixed combustion, and thus resulting in the higher HC, CO and smoke and lower NOx emissions. Ethyl ester generates lower number concentration in nucleation mode, while it has higher number concentration in accumulation mode. The primary particle size of ethyl ester is larger than that of methyl ester. These results indicate that molecular structure of ester has great influence in combustion and emission characteristics.

In contrast to the past studies that have attempted to use unprocessed CNSL directly as substitute for diesel, this study has resorted to use processed CNSL by cracking it using zeolite catalyst. Thus, both the extraction of CNSL from cashew nut outer shell and processing of it through catalytic cracking process to help synthesize CC-CNSL (catalytically cracked CNSL) are different, which underscores {{the significance of the}} current work.

The research {{presented in this}} thesis assesses the performance efficiency of a three-zone prototype catalytic converter in reducing exhaust emissions from a gasoline engine, operating in HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) and SI (Spark Ignition) mode under lean and stoichiometric conditions. The research was carried out using Jaguar V 6 engine operating in SI and HCCI mode using commercial unleaded gasoline fuel. The catalyst efficiency in reducing the three pollutant emissions {{is closely related to}} the exhaust gas conditions (e. g. temperature and space velocity), oxygen content and composition i. e. NOx, CO and HC concentrations. As part of this study a quantitative and qualitative analysis of C 1 -C 11 hydrocarbon compounds achieved before and after the catalytic converter. The results show that hydrocarbon species formation in the combustion process and destruction over the catalyst is primarily dependent on the engine operation and combustion mode (i. e. HCCI or SI). Alkane concentrations were found to be higher in the HCCI mode, while alkene species were mainly found in the engine exhaust under SI mode. The analysis showed that the HCCI exhaust contained heavier hydrocarbon species (e. g. toluene, p-exylene, naphthalene and methylnaphthalene) compared to the exhaust from the SI engine operation. Methane, Naphthalene and methylnaphthalene were the most resistant compounds while toluene was the most degradable compound over the catalyst. ...|$|R
