40|$|Background: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> {{problems}} are antecedents for later psychopathology. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences shaping the longitudinal association between childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems and specific PEs. Method: In a community-based twin sample, parents reported on <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems when twins were ages 7 and 12 years. At age 16 years, specific PEs were measured using self-reports and parent reports. Structural equation model-fitting was conducted. Results: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems were {{significantly associated with}} paranoia, cognitive disorganisation and parent-rated negative symptoms in adolescence (mean r =. 15 –. 38), {{and to a lesser extent}} with hallucinations, grandiosity and anhedonia (mean r =. 04 -. 12). Genetic influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent paranoia (4 %), cognitive disorganisation (8 %) and parent-rated negative symptoms (3 %). Unique environmental influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems explained ≤ 1 % of variance in PEs. Common environmental influences were only relevant for the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems and parent-rated negative symptoms (explaining 28 % of variance) and are partly due to correlated rater effects. Conclusions: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> {{problems are}} significantly, if weakly, associated with adolescent PEs. These associations are driven in part by common genetic influences underlying both <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems and PEs. However, psychotic experiences in adolescence are largely influenced by genetic and environmental factors that are independent of general childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems, suggesting they are not merely an extension of childhood <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The NMDA receptor-mediated {{glutamate}} system {{plays an}} important role in brain development and maturation in the period of early development. Physically-enriched environments positively influence cognitive performance and produce neuroanatomical changes in the brain. Material and Method: In our study, we evaluated the effects of NMDA receptor hypoactivity and physical environmental enrichment during childhood on emotional and cognitive functions in adult Balb/c mice. NMDA receptor hypofunction was induced during this developmental period using MK- 801 (for 5 days, 0. 25 mg/kg twice a day, intraperitoneal). Balb/c were mice treated with MK- 801 and reared in standard or environmentally enriched conditions, then <b>emotional</b> <b>behaviours</b> were assessed using the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), and cognitive functions were assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM). Results: MK- 801 administration decreased anxiety-related behaviours in the OF (p 0. 05).

Mothers (n = 150) and fathers (n = 125) representing 155 children participated in this study. Child <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems and parental worries about the child were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist at both time points. Parents' level of acute subjective distress was assessed within the first month after the burn event with the Impact of Event Scale. Mothers and fathers held comparable views of their child's <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems, which were generally within the normal limits.

A substantial part of mothers' and fathers' worries about the child concerned physical and emotional aspects of the burn trauma, and potential future social problems. Parents with high acute stress scores more often reported burn-related concerns about their child at 3 and 12 months postburn. Health-care professionals should be informed that parents' distress in the subacute phase of their child's burn event may be related to subsequent worries about their child and to (parent-observed) child <b>emotional</b> and <b>behaviour</b> problems.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{emotional}} feeling comprises the following two emotional qualia. (1) A nucleus feeling or primary emotional quale, which is the phenomenological counterpart of the end product of appraisal by the central nervous system. (2) The experience of being urged to emotion-related reflection or secondary emotional quale, which is the phenomenological counterpart of the brain’s decision to inhibit pre-programmed <b>emotional</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and to initiate emotion-related reflections. Different brain modules regulate these two qualia, and thus each can be experienced independently of the other. The primary emotional quale is related to activation of the amygdala, it is emotion specific, and neutral with respect to affect. The secondary emotional quale is related to activation of the orbito-prefrontal cortex (O-PFC), and includes affective aspects. It {{is argued that}} <b>emotional</b> <b>behaviour</b> is regulated by the following three neural mechanisms, two of which two {{are directly related to}} the two qualia. (1) An evolutionary ancient system (amygdala-system), which comprises the amygdalae and subcortical nuclei, and which activates pre-programmed <b>emotional</b> <b>behaviour.</b> (2) An evolutionary recent system (PFC-system), comprising the prefrontal cortex, which inhibits pre-programmed <b>emotional</b> <b>behaviour,</b> activates emotional reflection, generates and evaluates behavioural alternatives. In contrast to the preprogrammed behaviour, the behavioural alternatives are more likely to serve longterm goals. (3) A default mechanism, which gives rise to default (i. e., ‘‘just do something’’) behaviour. The first two systems are mutually competitive, while the third mechanism takes over if either the competition between the first two mechanisms, or the decision process of the PFC-system, takes too long.

40|$|Frontotemporal lobar {{degeneration}} (FTLD) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} associated with dramatic changes in emotion. The precise nature of these changes is not fully understood; however, {{we believe that the}} most salient losses relate to self-relevant processing. Thus, FTLD patients exhibit emotional changes that are con-sistent with a reduction in self-monitoring, self-awareness and the ability to place the self in a social context. In contrast, other more primitive aspects of the emotional system may remain relatively intact. The startle response is a useful way to examine the precise nature of emotional deficits in neurological patients. In addition to a stereotyped defensive response (characterized by negative <b>emotional</b> facial <b>behaviour</b> and physiological activation), in many individuals it also evokes embarrassment, a self-conscious emotional response. Embarrass-ment seems to occur as the person becomes aware that the reaction to the startle was excessive and was observed by others. Because the self-conscious response depends on certain regions in frontal cortex, we expected that FTLD patients would have specific deficits in their self-conscious response. To test this notion, we examined the response of 30 FTLD patients and 23 cognitively normal controls to a loud, unexpected acoustic startle stimulus (115 -dB burst of white noise). <b>Emotional</b> <b>behaviours</b> were measured along with an assessment of somatic, electrodermal, cardiovascular and respiratory responses.
