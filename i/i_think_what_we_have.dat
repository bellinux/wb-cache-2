It was another life to this, quite a {{different}} life; and there was a great story in it of which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been going through is either a sequel or a prologue. I see, or saw, cities and temples with people moving about them, George and you among them, also that old priest, Harût. You will laugh, but my recollection is that you stood in some relationship to me, either that of father or brother." ...|$|E

[...] "Where all did well there were two who chiefly helped us to win what we have done, and it is to our sorrow that one goes back to his own country now that his work is well accomplished. We will not lightly forget him. The other will, I hope, be spared to stay with you and share your triumphs as he has done your adversity. I have to {{announce}} my daughter's approaching marriage to your comrade, Henry Ormesby." ...|$|E
60|$|The jolliest {{indoor games}} {{for boys and}} girls demand a floor, and the home that has no floor upon which games may be played falls so far short of happiness. It must be a floor covered with {{linoleum}} or cork carpet, so that toy soldiers and such-like will stand up upon it, and of a color and surface that will take and show chalk marks; the common green-colored cork carpet without a pattern is the best of all. It must be no highway to other rooms, and well lit and airy. Occasionally, alas! it must be scrubbed--and then a truce to Floor Games. Upon such a floor may be made an infinitude of imaginative games, not only keeping boys and girls happy for days together, but building up a framework of spacious and inspiring ideas in them for after life. The men of tomorrow will gain new strength from nursery floors. I am going to tell of some of these games and what is most needed to play them; I have tried them all and a score of others like them with my sons, and all of the games here illustrated have been set out by us. I am going to tell of them here because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done will interest other fathers and mothers, and perhaps be of use to them (and to uncles and such-like tributary sub-species of humanity) in buying presents for their own and other people's children.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did on ... How the West was Won - that 1972 gig - {{is pretty}} much a {{testament}} of how good it was. It {{would have been nice}} to have had a little more visual recordings, but there you go. That’s the conundrum of Led Zeppelin! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know," [...] he said, [...] "we school {{ourselves}} to despise human nature. But God {{did not make}} us despicable, and I say, whatever end He meant us for, He must have some such thrill of joy in our adequacy to fate as a father feels when his son shows himself a man. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can be if we must, I can't believe the least of us shall finally perish." ...|$|R

5000|$|Patrick Murray {{left open}} the {{possibility}} of another run in his concession speech: [...] "We fought the best fight that's ever been fought in a very tough district, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here is a huge movement. So what we did is built a foundation, and we'll be back." ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{announced}} they were rehearsing and writing {{again for a}} new Waves album. Gash said: [...] "I'm very conscious it's very hard to beat the old songs that people will love. You tend to disappoint people with your follow-up stuff, {{but having said that}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are doing now is better. It is just as song-based so it's not like it's gone somewhere else, but as songs there is some really strong material there.|$|R

5000|$|Ayers {{was asked}} in a January 2004 interview, [...] "How {{do you feel about}} what you did? Would you do it again under similar circumstances?" [...] He replied: [...] "I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's {{impossible}} to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Schanberg {{returned}} to the POW/MIA subject during John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign {{in a series of}} articles for The Village Voice; he claimed that Kerry had shredded documents, suppressed testimony, and sanitized findings during his time as chairman of the committee. [...] Kerry denied these allegations and responded overall by saying, [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can take pride in is that we put together the most significant, most thorough, most exhaustive accounting for missing and former POWs in the history of human warfare." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think you}} always want to be {{sensitive}} to anybody that finds it offensive, that, you know ultimately the Indians name and the team, ah, is in recognition of our pride and affiliation with the first Native American baseball player. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> choose to do is celebrate, you know, Louis Sockalexis and his history and tradition with the Indians and, and not to focus on uh anything that we would view, that, you know, anything that we don't view and certainly don't want to put, uh, be offensive to anyone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Kinetic {{military}} action" [...] {{was used}} by White House aide Ben Rhodes on March 23, 2011 to describe U.S. military action in Libya: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals, which is protecting the Libyan people, averting a humanitarian crisis, and setting up a no-fly zone... Obviously that involves kinetic military action, particularly on the front end. This use was noted by news media: [...] "'Kinetic military action' is still hell" [...] and [...] "Kinetic Military Action No More".|$|R
5000|$|Karam {{said that}} he [...] "specifically aimed to create {{characters}} who 'push through their pain... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do in our lives. We try to find some laughs and love.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I promise that, father. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> after <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{have had}} to put up with here, during the past two or three months especially, I can bear {{anything}} for these last few days." ...|$|R
60|$|This, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{should have}} been told if the Pentateuch had been the {{invention}} of man. This is exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are NOT told; but, on the contrary, the very opposite.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isaac D.'s come, that's what," [...] said Mr. Dodd. [...] "I hain't b'en sleepin' well of nights, lately. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> was about, Jonathan, puttin' {{that girl}} in the school. We'd ought to've knowed she wahn't fit." ...|$|R
5000|$|Albarn {{described}} the sessions as [...] "putting things together that didnt work. We {{made a lot}} of mistakes but the ones that we thought worked we kept and put on the album. Theres still a few that Id like to have seen on the record, but it would have turned into a different record. Cause {{a lot of the other}} stuff was probably a bit rawer but still really interesting. The record may have been a double album and youd have had the laid back side and the more kind of fractious, difficult side and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted was to find the balance between those two." ...|$|R
5000|$|Promoting {{the tour}} Faye {{talked about the}} show stating [...] "It's going to be {{completely}} different to anything we've ever done before, we're {{going to have a}} real band which we've never done before because we've been very digital and this is coming back to a real raw performance". The other band members have also said that the show would be much more laid back and intimate for the fans which would show a different side to Steps. Lisa also said, [...] "We're going to do a mix of the new album and also our classic hits, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would like to do is to actually have an alternative version with some of them so they're not necessarily the songs as you know them".|$|R
500|$|... "So {{the real}} thing is, let's get some really wise heads {{together}} {{and figure out how}} you want to deal with the interim and long-term storage. Yucca was supposed to be everything to everybody, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> knowing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know today, there's {{going to have to be}} several regional areas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not good}} at the books," [...] Mr. Foker said, wagging his head--"never could manage that--Pendennis could--he used to do half the chaps' verses--and yet"--the young gentleman broke out, [...] "you are his guardian; and I hope you will pardon me for saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call flat," [...] the candid young gentleman said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you must}} have a horse. <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> over <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can do for you, in that way. There is no buying one here, unless a field officer is killed, or dies.|$|R
500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|R
5000|$|... "In effect we've had two {{elections}} here in Vanuatu. We've got {{the election}} here in town, Port Vila, and Efate, the island on which it's situated, {{and then the}} rest of the country where 80 per cent of the population lives. And I say that because in the lead up to the election a lot of the media, a lot of the analysts were predicting a mood for change. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> forgot in that debate, or in that discussion in the lead up to the election, what was {{the rest of the country}} talking about. The rural areas where the majority of people don't have access to newspapers, televisions and, in the last few years, radio because there's been a problem with the transmitter. And in a lot of cases the rural electorate has been totally disengaged from both the government process and certainly the political process. It's not about policy basis down there. It's about patronage. It's about personalities." ...|$|R

5000|$|... “I {{think that}} comes from them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy to}} wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> her shows always have is a real sense of optimism and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>we</b> all need today and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that came through in the bright patterns and colors and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s something that she does so well.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{must say}} there is {{something}} delightful about Paris, which you meet nowhere else," [...] said Mr. Sidney Wilton to Endymion. [...] "For my part, {{it has the same}} effect on me as a bottle of champagne. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were doing at this time last year--those dreadful November cabinets--I shudder! By the by, the Count of Ferroll says there is a chance of Lady Montfort coming here; have you heard anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have heard, Mrs. Arabin must {{be either}} there or at Venice, and I don't suppose I {{could learn from}} any one at Paris at which town she is staying at this moment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kay {{told the}} SASC during his oral report the following, though: [...] "Based on the {{intelligence}} that existed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Now that you know reality {{on the ground as}} opposed to what you estimated before, you may reach a different conclusion — although I must say <b>I</b> actually <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> learned during the inspection made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than, in fact, we thought it was even before the war." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hüller {{said that}} she always thinks [...] "about how humor works" [...] {{and it was this}} {{question}} [...] "we were asking ourselves during the process. What is it that makes people laugh? What is funny about Toni? I think...desperation...is the origin of comedy." [...] Falling out of a chair is [...] "the oldest joke." [...] But even when things don't work, [...] "you really have to try, seriously. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did — you never have to play the joke." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, Gomez, one of the executive producers on 13 Reasons Why, defended the series. She stated: [...] "We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what author Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do," [...] Gomez told Associated Press. [...] "We {{wanted to do it}} justice and, yeah, backlash is gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing." ...|$|R
