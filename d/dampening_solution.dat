50|$|The Printing Unit {{consists}} {{of many different}} systems. The dampening system is used to apply <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> to the plates with water rollers. The inking system uses rollers to deliver ink {{to the plate and}} blanket cylinders to be transferred to the substrate. The plate cylinder is where the plates containing all of the imaging are mounted. Finally the blanket and impression cylinders are used to transfer the image to the substrate running through the press.|$|E
50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|E

40|$|The {{birth of}} the first low earth orbit {{satellite}} network for packet switched data, was received with much enthusiasm. This enthusiasm was quickly <b>dampened</b> as <b>solution</b> developers went into Chapter 11 (protected liquidation in the USA) and faded away because the introduction of new technology to the market has not been so obvious - the aspects of commercialisation was not taken care off with the necessary caution. The basis {{of this study is to}} establish and assess reasons why commercialisation has been so difficult for solution developers using {{low earth orbit satellite}} communication in the high technology market, while it has been such a long awaited technology in the remote monitoring and telemetry fields In today's economy, the marketing of innovative technologies is of critical importance. Innovations succeed or fail in the marketplace based not just on the soundness of the technology, but also on a company's skills at bringing that technology to market and getting it adopted by customers. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to consumer or industrial marketing often prove inadequate when it comes to the introduction of new products in domains such as telecommunications. This study concentrates on and defines the additional aspects surrounding the commercialisation of discontinuous high technology products in new industrial markets.

40|$|Historically the {{producers}} of collotype printing have been secretive and taken a proprietary attitude toward the production of collotype prints. Therefore, knowledge about and information on {{the growth of the}} collotype industry has been minimal. Although the collotype process produces prints that are amoung the most beautiful and delicate of any graphic arts medium, collotypes presently are rarely produced commercially or even as an artistic medium. Eventually, the making of collotypes will be a lost art. The primary objective of this thesis was to produce a portfolio of photographic images which illustrates all of the production steps in the making of a collotype print. Included with the photographic essay is a condensed history of collotype, a technical review of the collotype printing process, and analysis of the present state of collotype printing. This thesis endeavors to ensure that the techniques used to produce collotype prints are accurately documented. In addition, the thesis presents an illustrated record of the contemporary collotype printing process. To ensure the proper procedures and techniques necessary to produce a quality collotype print, a collaboration with an expert collotype printer was initiated. Thus, the collotype printing and subsequent photographic documentation was done with Kent Kirby at his Light-print Press in Alma, Michigan. Kirby {{is one of a handful}} of individuals working in collotype today, and his studio is one of the last remaining collotype studios in the world. He is an expert collotype printmaker and the author of Studio Collotype, (1988) the most comprehensive manual on collotype printing. Though his book contains extensive information about collotype, it lacks a visual narrative of the collotype process. In addition to the photographic documentation, there is a written description of the collotype printing process. This includes sections on the press, plate preparation, plate exposure, substrate information, printing techniques, ink and its application, and <b>dampening</b> <b>solutions.</b> This thesis project also includes a historical background of the process and an analysis concerning the state of contemporary collotype for commercial and artistic applications. The research includes information gathered during interviews with expert contemporary collotype printers such as Kent Rush of the University of Texas, San Antonio, James Hajicek of Arizona State University and Kent Kirby. In addition, interviews were conducted with Michael Intrator of Black Box Collotype, Andre DePolo of Alinari Archive, Florence, Italy, Ms. Leibiger of Lichtdruck Grafisches Zentrum fur Druckkunst, Dresden, Germany, and Tom Reardon, formerly with The Jaffe Heliochrome Press, New York as to their insight into the demise of the commercial collotype. The backbone of this thesis project is a portfolio of eighteen original black-and-white matted and mounted silver prints that photographically document the collotype process. In addition to the documentary photographs, the portfolio also contains an original photograph and an original collotype reproduction. These two images enable the reader to compare the original silver print photograph and a photomechanical reproduction of it...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Surland 2 ̆ 7 s Emulsification Method, and is {{intended}} to demonstrate the effect of change in emulsification rate curve with different types of fountain solution whose surface tension was varied. The surface tension of a fountain solution can be changed {{by the addition of}} isopropyl alcohol. Two inks were modified to produce the same tack reading but a different emulsification capacity. Using the Surland method the two inks and two fountain solutions generate four different emulsification rate curves and these four curves are tested for their effect on printed quality. The printing performance of an ink is judged by the ease with which an ink can obtain ink-water balance as well as the degree of freedom from printing problems such as 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 and plate scumming. The printed sheets are sampled and the data is analyzed statistically using solid ink density and dot gain as response variables. The RIT Symmetrical Scale was included in the printing form design to facilitate solid ink density measurement and dot gain calculation. Solid ink density and dot gain variations are calculated within each printing run. The addition of isopropul alcohol to a <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> not only reduces its surface tension and increase its wettability but it also suppresses an ink 2 ̆ 7 s continuous emulsification tendency. Ink and water balance is easily controlled when a printing ink is able to reach a state of equilibrim with <b>dampening</b> <b>solution.</b> On the basis of observation during the on press printing run it was found that a high percentage of isopropyl alcohol in a <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> can dissolve the blue toner from the black ink and requires an increase of ink feed to obtain the desired optical density. This study indicates the tendency of plate 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 can be associated with emulsification rate curves. The Pb type of emulsification rate curve can be so modified that press run will encounter fewer problems. Density variation within a press run is then more easily controlled...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlcohol free “wet” offset {{technology}} {{is important not}} only for the sake of printers but for a stronger, more profitable business. The optimization of automatic offset printing system for the environmentally friendly dampening components via free alcohol and filtration procedures is a further milestone of the classical offset technology environmental approach. Offset printing, also named “wet” offset, uses <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> in order to keep non-printing elements as a hydrophilic on the surface of offset printing plate. So fountain solution is a part of its process. Generally it is composed by water and around of 8 - 10 % isopropyl alcohol as a surface active agent improved wetting. However, there are inherent issues with this process, such as negative environmental impact, health hazardous, complex press operations and waste water and chemical regulations. Isopropyl alcohol used in water solution in offset printing has negative influence as: part of it vaporizes to form volatile organic compounds that pollute the working environment, also toxic and flammable. Measured by volume IPA is the most significant air pollutant in the offset printing companies. In the common ecology savings conditions there are alternative ways to reduce or even fully IPA-free printing, lowering costs and risks for health and safety the environment. In web offset printing are several possibilities to apply alcohol free <b>dampening</b> <b>solution.</b> In this study for the CSWO (Cold Set Web Offset) printing it was applied fully alcohol free solution with specially developed additive, compatible to individual tap water properties. In addition here was used ceramic filtration system in order to prevent fast contamination and also permit longer intervals between changing the fountain solution and keeps it clean during the long period. So in this way we achieved having stable printing process without any problems...|$|E
40|$|There are latest {{aspects of}} {{problems}} of dampening printing plates in offset printing {{based on the}} analysis of the influence of the parameters of plate?s elements, of printing ink and <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> components, the state of printing machine, preparation of technological solutions, of their automation and computerization. The current state of problems and prospects of improving processes damping in offset printing are analyzed and the urgency for the production of various products are determined. The most important parameters that characterize the properties of the solution and therefore actively influence the effectiveness of humidification and quality of prints is surface tension, pH, electrical conductivity. These numbers depend on the components of the solution. An important area of current research is to improve measurement systems and maintain the film thickness wetting solution to form intermediate elements and rollers wetting machine. Use of antibacterial additives for stability of run of printing plates during printing and improve environmental production, thereby increasing productivity and processes of moisture in offset printing are established. ??????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ?????????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????, ????????? ???????? ??????, ????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????, ?? ????????????? ? ???????????????...|$|E

The oscillations are also a viscous phenomenon that does not <b>dampen</b> as the <b>solution</b> marches through steady state.

40|$|Spreading {{depression}} (SD) {{is characterized}} by a sustained near-complete depolarization of neurons, a massive depolarization of glia, and a negative deflection of the extracellular DC potential. These electrophysiological signs are accompanied by an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) which arises from changes in light scattering and absorption. Even though the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the IOS serves as non-invasive tool to define the spatiotemporal dynamics of SD in brain slices. Usually the tissue is illuminated by white light, and light reflectance or transmittance is monitored. Using a polychromatic, fast-switchable light source we now performed temporo-spectral recordings of the IOS associated with hypoxia-induced SD-like depolarization (HSD) in rat hippocampal slices kept in an interface recording chamber. Recording full illumination spectra (320 – 680 nm) yielded distinct reflectance profiles for the different phases of HSD. Early during hypoxia tissue reflectance decreased within almost the entire spectrum due to cell swelling. HSD was accompanied by a reversible reflectance increase being most pronounced at 400 nm and 460 nm. At 440 nm massive porphyrin absorption (Soret band) was detected. Hypotonic solutions, Ca 2 +-withdrawal and glial poisoning intensified the reflectance increase during HSD, whereas hypertonic <b>solutions</b> <b>dampened</b> it. Replacement of Cl- inverted the reflectance increase. Inducing HSD by cyanide distorted the IOS and reflectance at 340 – 400 nm increased irreversibly. The pronounced changes at short wavelengths (380 nm, 460 nm) and their cyanide sensitivity suggest that block of mitochondrial metabolism contributes t...|$|R
40|$|We analyze with DFT {{calculations}} {{the charge}} {{effects on the}} reactivity of the polycationic Compound I (Cpd I) and Compound II (Cpd II) mimics experimentally investigated by Bell and Groves (Bell, S. R.; Groves, J. T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 9640). Specifically, we consider the Cpd I model [(4 -THPyP) •+(H 2 O) FeIV═O] 5 + (THPyP = 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis(N-hydro- 4 -pyridinium) porphyrinate), 1 H 2 O, and its Cpd II counterparts [(4 -THPyP) FeIV═O] 4 +, 2, and [(4 -THPyP) (H 2 O) FeIV═O] 4 +, 2 H 2 O. In gas phase simulations {{it is found that}} all positive charges enhance the reactivity. According to a detailed electronic structure analysis in the gas phase of the reactant complexes en route to the transition state, the positive charges stabilize the electron acceptor orbital (EAO) of the catalyst more than the electron donor orbital (EDO) of the substrate, thereby reducing the energy gap between these orbitals and, hence, the H-abstraction barrier. The effect of the peripheral charges residing on the pyridinium groups is <b>dampened</b> in water <b>solution</b> by screening effects of the solvent. However, the effect of the positive charge residing on the porphyrin ring of the Cpd I mimic is not much diminished by the solvent. The well-known stronger oxidizing capability of Cpd I mimics relative to their Cpd II counterparts is ascribed to the effect on the frontier orbitals of the positive charge on the ring, rather than to the presence of a hole per se...|$|R
40|$|This degree project {{illustrates}} newsprint and waterless offset. A new news {{press was}} introduced at Drupa- 00, Cortina from KBA, {{which is the}} first news press dedicated the waterless technique. With actual statistics from the company in question an investigation was made whether their production fits this press. It came out in the investigation that the production of the company, from statistics, fits this press very good. A table was made where different timeschedules were accounted for the new press, with semi- and full automatic plate changing for present and to be added papers. The waterless technology is compared to conventional offset with the difference that the plate is based on a sort of laminatetechnology. Like conventional plates this plate has a base made of aluminium. Lightsensitive photopolymer isunited as a layer or coat on top of the aluminium and a 2 µm thin oleophobic siliconlayer is applied on top of the photopolymer. Considering the print, the waterless method has a higher qualitygrade than conventional offset. No water is emulsifiedin the ink, and therefore the printed dot gets a higher density. The loss of <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> and higher tack of the ink gives sharper dots. This makes the colourspace bigger why a greater range of colours can be printed. The loss of <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> gives a more stable dotgain, which contributes to that a higher screen can be used. The disadvantage is that the plate can't do as many rotations as the conventional plate. A waterless plate makes around 100 000 - 500 000 rotations before it needs to be removed owing to type- and manufacturer of the plate. The plate is also slightly more sensitive and expensive than conventional plates, around 1, 4 - 1, 7 × aluminium printing plates. A waterless system can be installed in a conventional printing press by degrees and when large editions are being printed a cooler needs to be installed in the oscillationrollers of the press, since an increase in temperature can make the oleophobic parts of the plate oleophilic. The Cortina is however equipped with a temperature controlsystem at the beginning. To avoid picking, caused by the tacky ink, a blanket with a high “quick release” should be used...|$|E

Sadly, print has allowed itself to be commonly seen as an environmentally destructive medium, {{despite the fact that}} much of print media is based on comparatively benign and renewable materials. This is particularly ironic in that print has incredible potential to be a far more sustainable medium than it is today… and to become the means for printing flexible polymer digital electronics as well. With environmental concerns playing a large role in all kinds of manufacturing industries, the concept of sustainability remains elusive. There are many common steps a print factory can take to reduce the impact that carbon foot print have on environment. It is only with truly holistic approach towards environmental protection we can effectively reduce CO 2 emissions and bring down carbon foot print. While CO 2 is created in manufacturing of the printing press and of printed products, there are other significant emissions involved in a print production.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaMentha L. is a genus of {{aromatic}} perennial herbs {{belonging to}} the family Lamiaceae distributed mostly in temperate and sub-temperate regions of the world. Different species of mint are used for their medicinal and aromatic properties, and cultivated for their essential oils and monoterpenes components of the oil, for use in food, flavour, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Pests and pathogens of Mentha may cause substantial damage to the crop and considerable loss in oil yield. The concern about the negative effects caused by synthetic pesticides such environmental pollution, development of phenomena of resistance at treated insect populations and toxicity at different trophic levels led to a search for natural and environmentally friendly products. Plant extracts can be an alternative for a pest management with little harmfulness to environment. The present study was aimed at the repellent/insecticidal properties of Mentha cervina L. essential oil (EO) against ants, {{the identification of the}} insects associated to M. cervina and M. pulegium L., and fungi associated to M. cervina. The essential oils were obtained by hidrodestillation by using Clevenger apparatus of dried plant material. Two species of ants - Tapinoma nigerrimum Nylander and Aphaenogaster senilis Mayr - were used to study the repellent/insecticidal properties of M. cervina oil. The experimental unit corresponded to a system of two compartments separated by a PVC pipe containing a layer of filter paper <b>dampened</b> with EO <b>solutions.</b> Groups of 10 insects per replicate were placed in one of the compartments. The opposite compartment contained food. This allowed the insects to come into contact with the treated papers. Four concentrations were tested and each was replicated three times for T. nigerrimum and five times for A. senilis. EO was dissolved in ethanol and prepared with distilled water with different concentrations: 2, 5; 5; 0, 10, 0 and 20, 0 μg/cm 2. Distilled water and 1 % (v/v) ethanol (96 %) were used as control. The effects on T. nigerrimum mortality were evaluated after 24 to 144 hours. Concentration OE 2, 5 μg/cm 2 provided 70 % mortality after 72 hours. The effects on A. senilis were evaluated after 24 to 196 hours. Concentration OE 2, 5 μg/cm 2 provided 72 % mortality after 192 hours. Percent mortality data were analysed by ANOVA (SPSS v. 15. 0), Tukey’s test was used to compare the difference between treatments. The plant materials studied were collected from seedbeds located at the Botanic Park of Tapada da Ajuda at the Agronomic Institut of the Technical University of Lisbon. In order to deepen knowledge about insects associated to M. cervina and M. pulegium, samples were surveyed from 39 accessions of M. cervina and 3 accessions of M. pulegium, in July, September, October and November 2008, weekly. The specimens collected were preserved in 70 % ethanol for identification. In all, 604 insects were identified comprising 4 different orders and 15 families. The higher number of insects found belongs to the orders Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Mites were identified in 12 accessions of M. cervina, comprising 4 families and four species. In order to study the fungi associated to M. cervina, 30 accessions were selected. Samples were surveyed between October and November 2007, by visual observation of dried and/or necrotic plants. The surface sterilized roots and stems segments were evenly spaced in Petri dishes containingpotato dextrose agar (PDA) and potassium thiocyanate (KCNS 5 %) medium. With the identification of the isolates, 12 genera were identified. The most predominant genera were Alternaria e Fusarium. These two genera and the species Colletotrichum coccodes and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum are cited in the literature as pathogenic to Mentha species.

40|$|In an offset {{printing}} machine the rollers (ink unit) and the cylinders (printing unit) are in contact {{in a lot}} of places. The contact surfaces comprise a metal surface and a rubber surface. As appears from findings based on the professional literature and experience of people working in printing houses the issue of contact between ink rollers and printing cylinders in an {{offset printing}} machine is of great importance. It has impact on the quality of printouts (generation of printouts errors), consumption of energy, time of making the printing machine ready for operation, wear of the machine’s components and related consumables like ink, <b>dampening</b> <b>solution,</b> paper, ink rollers, plate. During the theoretical studies, the equations were derived to show how the rollers compression depends on the contact area width and clamping force. The equations involve Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of rollers ’ materials. The difference between these equations and the so far existing equations has resulted from changing the place of applying the clamping force and involving Poisson’s ratio. The paper includes the comparison of the aforesaid new equations and those known from the literature. Moreover, the relation-ship in between the contact area width and the compression of metal roller and rubber-covered roller was subject to experimental at-tempts aimed at verification of the equation presented.

40|$|In offset printing, <b>dampening</b> <b>solution</b> is used {{to create}} a good balance in the process. If too much water is {{transferred}} to the paper, the sheet can change its size between the printing units, due to water absorption, and cause a problem with the colour register. This phenomenon is usually referred to as fanout. In this degree project, an investigation was made to see if the paper dimensions changed through its way in the sheet-fed printing process. The instrument Luchs Register Measuring Systems (Lynx) was used, and a method for measuring if the paper changed its dimensions with this instrument, was developed. Paper qualities with three different grammages were used, 90, 130 and 250 gsm. This investigation showed that all paper qualities changed their size with widening in the gripper edge in the range of 10 - 70 µm and in the trailing edge the increase was 10 - 130 µm. The elongations of the papers were in the range of 10 - 300 µm. The papers with lowest grammage changed more than the heavier. To see if the print had been affected of the widening and elongation, print quality parameters like relative contrast, dot gain and mottle were correlated with the Lynx data from the sheets. The group of papers that gave correlations were in 130 gsm. The sheets had visual doubling and the combined standard deviation from the Lynx marks K 3, K 5 and K 21 correlated with dot gain. When the variations increased so did the dot gain and this indicates that the doubling was due to the widening. There was also a correlation between the standard deviation from K 3 and Mottle. The sheets widened with an average of 30 µm in the gripper edge and since there probably were doubling due to widening it also affected the Mottle values. What the widening depends on is hard to tell. Since widening was so small, it could be due to water absorption, papers being ironed out or maybe the sheets have been flattened out. It probably needs a more detailed investigation to find out what causes the widening. Further investigations about how print quality is affected by the register accuracy of a printing machine should include a print form with measuring areas close to the Lynx marks. The measuring areas should contain fine hairlines, negative text printed with at least two colours and some pictures to evaluate together with standard measuring should give a good knowledge about the subject...|$|E
