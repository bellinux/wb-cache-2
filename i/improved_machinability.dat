50|$|Before the Second World War, metal was the {{standard}} material used for surface plates, however, the war efforts of various countries put {{a strain on}} the availability of metal. A monument and metal shop owner (Wallace Herman) in Dayton, Ohio, along with his inventive employee Donald V. Porter, started using granite in place of metal for his surface plates. Today most surface plates continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant surface plates being made of quartz-bearing granite. The quartz content of these granite surface plates increases the wear resistance of the plate as quartz is a harder stone. Black granite is dominantly used in machine bases, granite accessories, and custom applications for its superior stiffness, excellent vibration dampening, and <b>improved</b> <b>machinability.</b> Quartz-bearing granite (usually pink, white, or grey) is often made thicker than black granite to provide equal load-bearing capabilities of the types of material used for surface plates as it is not as stiff as black granite.|$|E

40|$|Dental {{prostheses}} {{are usually}} {{made by a}} casting process. Most currently available dental alloys are therefore developed to facilitate dental casting. Cutting and grinding of dental materials have been regarded as finishing processes rather than forming methods. Current CAD/CAM technology is a considerable advancement over conventional dental casting, and machining {{has become one of}} the important forming methods. However, few dental alloys have been developed for good machinability (ease of cutting or grinding). Titanium is widely known as an excellent biomaterial because of its superior biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, but it remains one of the most difficult dental materials to process. Some dental applications demand materials with high strength as well as <b>improved</b> <b>machinability.</b> To this end, in this study, experimental titanium alloys were developed for dental CAD/CAM systems. The alloying elements chosen were copper, silver, and gold from β-eutectoid elements and zirconium, niobium, and hafnium from β-isomorphous elements. Among the experimental binary titanium alloys tested, certain Ti-Ag alloys were found to provide both better machinability and higher strength compared to unalloyed titanium. The <b>improved</b> <b>machinability</b> could be attributed to the finely dispersed brittle second phase that reduces elongation. The Ti-Ag alloys showed both corrosion resistance comparable to unalloyed titanium and anti-biofilm characteristics with no bactericidal activity. The spontaneous formation of calcium phosphate on the alloys in simulated body fluid was also confirmed. Ti-Ag alloys are thus good candidates for use as machinable dental biomaterials...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} hBN content on microstructure, {{mechanical}} properties, and machinability of the pressureless-sintered Si 3 N 4 ceramics were investigated. Flexural strength, Young’s modulus, and hardness decreased with increasing h-BN content. The mechanical properties are decreased {{mainly because of}} increased porosity of composite, and the much lower Young's modulus of BN {{compared to that of}} Si 3 N 4. Pressureless-sintered Si 3 N 4 /hBN composites exhibit strong texture of BN grains oriented with the c-axis parallel to the cold-pressing direction. Cutting resistance of Si 3 N 4 ceramic composites with more than 10 vol % hBN decreased with increasing hBN content, demonstrating a good machinability of the composites.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of machining operations use some type of cutting lubrication to facilitate <b>improved</b> <b>machinability,</b> which also constitutes reductions in surface roughness and increases in tool life. This occurs {{as a function of}} reducing the temperature at the cutting interface or zone and by providing a fluidised cushion between the cutter and the cutting interface. This also aids in improving chip formation and chip morphology. However, the major drawback of using conventional coolant is the increased environmental impact of coolant recycling. Other methods have been recently investigated and include chilled air and cryogenic methods. This paper provides one of the first attempts at using cryogenic coolant and lubrication methods for CNC milling of T 6 aluminium using carbide tooling. The results suggest that using cryogenic methods provides a realistic alternative to conventional coolants for milling applications that is not only more environmentally friendly, but also reduces the surface roughness, provides better chip formation and increases tool life...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a dynamical phase transition occurring within a shear band at high temperature and under extremely high shear rates. With increasing temperature, dislocation deformation and grain boundary sliding are supplanted by amorphization {{in a highly}} localized nanoscale band, which allows for massive strain and fracture. The mechanism is similar to shear melting and leads to liquid metal embrittlement at high temperature. From simulation, {{we find that the}} necessary conditions are lack of dislocation slip systems, low thermal conduction, and temperature near the melting point. The first two are exhibited by bcc titanium alloys, and we show that the final one can be achieved experimentally by adding low-melting-point elements: specifically, we use insoluble rare earth metals (REMs). Under high shear, the REM becomes mixed with the titanium, lowering the melting point within the shear band and triggering the shear-melting transition. This in turn generates heat which remains localized in the shear band due to poor heat conduction. The material fractures along the shear band. We show how to utilize this transition in the creation of new titanium-based alloys with <b>improved</b> <b>machinability...</b>|$|E
