We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

25|$|Compressed {{hydrogen}} is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures {{to increase the}} storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology. Car manufacturers have been <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> solution, such as Honda or Nissan.|$|E
25|$|Schrödinger's cat is {{a thought}} experiment, usually {{described}} as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates {{what he saw as}} the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The thought experiment presents a cat that might be alive or dead, depending on an earlier random event. In the course of <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> experiment, he coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement).|$|E

25|$|In <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> new car, Nash had {{originally}} planned {{to call it}} the Diplomat. This name would have rounded out the Nash family of cars; as for 1950, the 600 line was renamed the Statesman, and the Ambassador remained the flagship line. When it was learned that Dodge had already reserved the Diplomat name for a planned two-door hardtop body style, Nash delved into its own past, and resurrected the Rambler name from an 1897 prototype and its first production model, in 1902. Rambler {{was also one of the}} popular early American automobile brands.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods of {{improvisation}} and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In the process of <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates a rug as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch and digging gestures to create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and software performance.|$|E

25|$|This {{new school}} of thought and design with {{strongly}} implement traditional elements using 20th-century technologies and Modernist architectural principles from Europe appeared mainly in the 1920s and 1930s. Indigenous roofs were singled out for particular attention {{and there were many}} interesting syntheses of local and European forms and construction techniques. The interest of Modernists in the dynamic interplay of geometrical elements was soon incorporated into the new style and led to bold experiments that combined these structural forms with traditional vernacular ornamentation. Thomas Karsten and Henri Maclaine Pont were among the architects active in <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hindemith's music {{employs a}} unique {{system that is}} tonal but non-diatonic. Like most tonal music, it is centred on a tonic and modulates from one tonal centre to another, but it uses all 12 notes freely {{rather than relying on}} a scale picked as a subset of these notes. Hindemith even rewrote some of his music after <b>developing</b> <b>this</b> system. One of the key {{features}} of his system is that he ranks all musical intervals of the 12-tone equally tempered scale from the most consonant to the most dissonant. He classifies chords in six categories, on the basis of how dissonant they are, whether or not they contain a tritone, {{and whether or not they}} clearly suggest a root or tonal centre. Hindemith's philosophy also encompassed melody—he strove for melodies that do not clearly outline major or minor triads.|$|E

Beagle, a sum equivalent to about £ in [...] He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher. As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer's proofs.|$|E
