5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E

The dog lice, Trichodectes canis and human flea (Pulex irritans) also trans-mit <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum infection. Infants and young children {{are at high risk}} of acquiring infection. Majority of the infections are due to close association with pet dog and cats. Humans are accidental hosts who acquire infection by ingestion of infected dog and cat fleas.

40|$|AbstractWe {{provide the}} first genetic {{sequence}} data for a <b>Dipylidium</b> species from a wild carnivore plus {{an analysis of}} the effects of ecological, demographic, physiological and behavioural factors on <b>Dipylidium</b> sp. infection prevalence in a social carnivore, the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Our sequence data from a mitochondrial gene fragment (1176 base pair long) had a similarity of between 99 % and 89 % to <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum. We determined infection prevalence in 146 faecal samples from 124 known animals in three social groups (termed clans) using molecular screening and <b>Dipylidium</b> proglottid presence. Our analysis revealed significantly higher infection prevalence in juveniles (55 %) than adults (15. 8 %), indicating that predominantly juveniles maintained infection in clans. The likelihood of infection in juveniles significantly: (1) increased as the number of adults and older juveniles (> 6 months) at communal dens increased, implying a positive relationship between this factor {{and the size of the}} intermediate host (probably a flea species) population at communal dens; (2) decreased as the number of younger juveniles (< 6 months) increased, suggesting that the chance of susceptible juveniles ingesting infected fleas during self-grooming declined as the number of infected fleas per younger juvenile declined; and (3) decreased during periods of low prey abundance in clan territories when an increased reliance on long-distances foraging excursions reduces the number of clan members visiting communal dens, possibly resulting in a decline in flea populations at dens. Long-distance foraging also increases the intervals (in days) between nursing visits by lactating females to their offspring. Lengthy intervals between milk intake by infected juveniles may reduce adult <b>Dipylidium</b> fecundity and hence decrease infection prevalence in the den flea population. Our study provides useful insights into <b>Dipylidium</b> epidemiology in a social carnivore population subject to large fluctuations in prey abundance...|$|E

40|$|Stray cats play {{a crucial}} role in the {{epidemiology}} of endoparasites, particularly helminths, due to predating a wide range of both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, often of veterinary and zoonotic importance. Therefore, a total of 62 stray cats were necropsied in Beni-Suef province, Egypt and examined for helminth parasites. The overall prevalence of infection was 87. 0 %. The recovered helminths consisted of 10 species of trematodes (Heterophyes heterophyes, Pygidiopsis summa, H. nocens, Echinochasmus liliputanus, Alaria sp., Procerovum varium, Ascocotyle sp., Haplorchis sp., Prohemistomum vivax, Euparadistomum herpestesi), five cestodes (<b>Dipylidium</b> caninum, Diplopylidium acanthoterta, D. nolleri, Joyeuxiella sp. and Taenia taeniaeformis), and two nematodes (Toxascaris leonina and larvae of Anisakis simplex). The most prevalent helminths were <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum (62. 9 %), Toxascaris leonina (33. 8 %), Diplopylidium nolleri (22. 5 %) and Echinochasmus liliputanus (6. 45 %). Thirty (48. 39 %) cats were co-infected by one species, 22 (35. 48 %) by two and three (4. 84 %) by more than two species. It has been found that cats aged more than 3 years were the most infected. Both male and female cats were parasitized. The infection was the most prevalent in both summer and autumn.

40|$|Background : Zoonotic parasitoses are {{a public}} health problem because they are {{distributed}} worldwide. Soil contamina- tion with dog faeces is an important worldwide problem because it facilitates the transmission of zoonotic parasites. It {{has been reported in}} different studies that soil contamination by parasites represents a risk factor for the population (mainly children) to acquire parasitic diseases caused by <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum, Ancylostoma spp., and Trichuris spp. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to analyse soil samples collected from fi ve public parks in the city of Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico for the presence of canine soil-transmitted parasites. Materials, Methods & Results : A total of 1726 soil samples were obtained from fi ve public parks in Nezahualcoyotl County, Mexico and analysed for <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum, Ancylostoma spp., and Trichuris spp. eggs. Sampling was carried out in summer 2009 with the permission of the Parks and Public Gardens Nezahualcoyotl Offi ce. Samples were evaluated using a fl otation method, using microscopic observation for egg identifi cation. The data were analysed with the Kruskal- Wallis test and average mean percentages of contamination between the parks means were compared using the Nemenyi test. There were differences in the degree of contamination among the parks, but the soil characteristics were not correlated with the presence of parasite eggs. Contamination with <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum and Trichuris spp. were positively correlated (r = 0. 32, P < 0. 0001). Overall, there was a substantial frequency of Ancylostoma spp. (23. 7 %) and <b>Dipylidium</b> caninum (21. 7 %), with minor presence of Trichuris spp. (15. 3 %) in the parks. Discussion : Several {{studies have shown that the}} close relationship between resulting from the human-animal bond provides benefi ts for socialisation, mental health, and even physical well-being. However, owning a pet also allows potential health risks for the human population. Incidence studies of parasites in the soil of public parks provide greater insight regarding their zoonotic potential, and revealed that the soil of public parks is a source of infection and transmission of parasitic diseases. The reports on soil parasites contamination vary depending on where in the in the world were conducted. Studies in Brazil and Argentina had twice the levels of contamination for Ancylostoma spp. eggs andlower levels of D. caninum. However, the degree of contamination for Trichuris spp. in this report was higher than that observed in public parks in other countries (Croatia, Nigeria, and Brazil). These studies indicate that the risk of acquiring a zoonotic parasitic infec- tion is extremely high, since the soil is highly contaminated with infectious eggs of parasites. The study of the prevalence of parasites in dogs and understanding of the life cycle, epidemiology, and risk factors involved require the establishment of prevention programs for public health reason. Therefore, it is important to implement measures for the collection of excreta in public parks and promote dog deworming programs and hygiene measures to prevent infection in paratenic hosts. The results of this research revealed that the soil of public parks were a source of parasitic zoonoses, because dogs play an important role in the contamination of soils by excreting intestinal parasites through their faeces, constituting {{a public health}} problem...|$|E
