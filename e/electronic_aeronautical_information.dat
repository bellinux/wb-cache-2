40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} legal, {{political}} and {{technical aspects of}} aeronautical information, with a particular focus on the situation of aeronautical information in Europe. It portrays the evolution of aeronautical information and its current nature. It looks at {{the responsibility for the}} publication of aeronautical information and the evolution of that notion due to recent trends towards corporatisation to the detriment of full State ownership. It also examines the question of liability for the publication of aeronautical information, including the various legal regimes under which victims of defective aeronautical information can claim compensation, as well as the legal mechanisms underlying and implementing such compensation regimes. The final chapter is concerned with <b>electronic</b> <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> and the specific legal challenges this technological revolution has brought about...|$|E

It was developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGIA) and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL).The current version is AIXM 5.1.1.|$|R

50|$|The <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> {{services}} must {{transition to}} a broader concept of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> management, with a different method of information provision and management given its data-centric nature {{as opposed to the}} product-centric nature of AIS. The expectations are that the transition to AIM will not involve many changes in terms of the scope of information to be distributed. The major change will be the increased emphasis on data distribution, which should place the future AIM in a position to better serve airspace users and air traffic management in terms of their information management requirements.|$|R
