5|$|Cats hunt small prey, {{primarily}} {{birds and}} rodents, {{and are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer.

The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal {{resulting in a}} steady turnover.|$|E

5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E

5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E
5|$|Syntactic {{coordination}} and subordination <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial).
