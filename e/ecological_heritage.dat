50|$|New Caledonia is a {{major source}} for nickel and {{contains}} roughly 10% of the worlds known nickel supply. The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel. With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the world's fifth largest producer after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000). In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing global financial crisis. Only a negligible amount {{of the land is}} suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys {{to the health of the}} economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro Nickel Plant is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth. When full-scale production begins in 2013 this plant will produce an estimated 20% of the global nickel supply. However, the need to respond to environmental concerns over the country's globally recognized <b>ecological</b> <b>heritage,</b> may increasingly need to be factored into capitalization of mining operations.|$|E

50|$|The Eastern Ring Road is a {{proposed}} Link between the South Arm Highway and the East Derwent Highway, within the greater area of Hobart, Tasmania. The {{idea behind the}} proposal is to see a continuous route from South Arm to the Bowen Bridge without the need to travel via the Tasman Highway. The proposal would see Flagstaff Gully Road extended to the north {{to meet up with}} the East Derwent Highway. The idea was first investigated in 1995 when Ratio Consultants did a study on the proposed link. They considered four options for the link, the most popular choice would connect to the East Derwent Highway between Geilston Bay and Risdon Vale. Ratio concluded that constructing any of the options would most likely produce an unacceptable level of visual landscape, <b>ecological,</b> <b>heritage</b> and water quality impacts.In 2005 during the Clarence City Council elections, Alderman Doug Chipman lobbied the State and Federal governments for the construction of the proposed link road. A link road between the Tasman Highway and the Bowen Bridge will be needed in the future to take the pressure off Begonia Street, Gordons Hill Road, the East Derwent Highway, and the Tasman Bridge/Brooker Highway — Doug Chipman Alderman Chipman also said at the time that while a Flagstaff Gully Link road may not be necessary right now, it probably will be in the next decade. Ald. Chipman suggested that planning should now be undertaken to ensure that when the road is needed, the government will have acquired the land, and informed anybody developing new properties in the area that the road will be built.In 2007 the Clarence City Council backed the proposal to extend the existing Flagstaff Gully Road. The council argued that, as this new road will be linking 2 state highways, it should be a state government responsibility. However, the state government saw it as a council issue.|$|E

To ensure their efficient management {{it is essential}} to have a full description of these multifunctional ecosystems and to know their evolution over time. This paper describes a method for monitoring watercourses and their riparian strips developed in Wallonia (southern Belgium). It is based on an inventory constructed by stratified random sampling comprising 1, 071 sampling plots distributed over a total length of 24, 600 km of watercourses covered from their source. Each sampling plot is surveyed and measurements and fine observations are made on watercourse segments 50 m long. The method developed, which was applied on a regional scale, could easily be transposed to other entities, from large river basins, to an entire country. Examples of results obtained from a first inventory phase demonstrate the utility of this tool designed to supply qualitative and quantitative information to assist watercourse management.

" One initiative associated with this new approach was the creation of land stewardship councils. This paper documents the steps towards increased involvement by citizens that resulted from activities of the Niagara Region’s land stewardship council- Land Care Niagara. The creation of a community liaison sub-committee, organization and implementation of a series of community consultations, and the emergence of an environmental network, are key components facilitating public involvement in stewardship activities. Growing organizational and individual interest in an emerging Natural <b>Heritage</b> <b>Ecological</b> Framework is a tangible sign of community-based support. This paper traces the key developments in the transition towards full citizen participation, identifying opportunities for public engagement, techniques used and challenges faced. The activities of the Community Liaison Sub-Committee of Land Care Niagara and the Natural <b>Heritage</b> <b>Ecological</b> Framework will both be of interest to groups and individuals concerned about impacts on the Niagara Escarpment. This paper is written from the vantagepoint of an action researcher, who has been both a participant in and an observer of the activities discussed.
