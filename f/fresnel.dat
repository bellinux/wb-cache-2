5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order <b>Fresnel</b> lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the <b>Fresnel</b> lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds.

5000|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} models, which were aimed to describe the relative motion of the Earth and aether, were Augustin-Jean <b>Fresnel's</b> (1818) model of the (nearly) stationary aether including a partial aether drag determined by <b>Fresnel's</b> dragging coefficient,and George Gabriel Stokes' (1844)model of complete aether drag. The latter theory was not considered as correct, since it was not compatible with the aberration of light, and the auxiliary hypotheses developed to explain this problem were not convincing. Also, subsequent experiments as the Sagnac effect (1913) also showed that this model is untenable. However, the most important experiment supporting <b>Fresnel's</b> theory was Fizeau's 1851 experimental confirmation of <b>Fresnel's</b> 1818 prediction that a medium with refractive index n moving with a velocity v would increase {{the speed of light}} travelling through the medium {{in the same direction as}} v from c/n to: ...|$|R
2500|$|Albert A. Michelson (1881) {{tried to}} measure the {{relative}} motion of the Earth and aether (Aether-Wind), as it was expected in <b>Fresnel's</b> theory, by using an interferometer. He could not determine any relative motion, so he interpreted the result as a confirmation of the thesis of Stokes. However, Lorentz (1886) showed Michelson's calculations were wrong {{and that he had}} overestimated the accuracy of the measurement. This, together with the large margin of error, made the result of Michelson's experiment inconclusive. In addition, Lorentz showed that Stokes' completely dragged aether led to contradictory consequences, and therefore he supported an aether theory similar to <b>Fresnel's.</b> To check <b>Fresnel's</b> theory again, Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) performed a repetition of the Fizeau experiment. <b>Fresnel's</b> dragging coefficient was confirmed very exactly on that occasion, and Michelson was now of the opinion that <b>Fresnel's</b> stationary aether theory was correct. To clarify the situation, Michelson and Morley (1887) repeated Michelson's 1881-experiment, and they substantially increased the accuracy of the measurement. However, this now famous Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment again yielded a negative result, i.e., no motion of the apparatus through the aether was detected (although the Earth's velocity is 60km/s different in the northern winter than summer). So the physicists were confronted with two seemingly contradictory experiments: the 1886-experiment as an apparent confirmation of <b>Fresnel's</b> stationary aether, and the 1887-experiment as an apparent confirmation of Stokes' completely dragged aether.|$|R
5|$|An {{indirect}} {{confirmation of}} <b>Fresnel's</b> dragging coefficient {{was provided by}} Martin Hoek (1868).|$|R
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of <b>Fresnel,</b> a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order <b>Fresnel</b> lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original <b>Fresnel</b> lens was installed in the new tower.

For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that <b>Fresnel's</b> formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium.

5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by RenÃ© Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August <b>Fresnel</b> clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic waveâ€”which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio wavesâ€”seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E

For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to make a choice of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther <b>Fresnel,</b> Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange.
