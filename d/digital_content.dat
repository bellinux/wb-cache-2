40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a rule {{annotation}} method using RuleML in the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard, called METS. By putting rules into METS, the collection levels of <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> {{can be set}} automatically, and their re-organization can be performed easily. Applying RuleML to the rule description {{is one of the}} promising methods for reorganizing <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> dynamically without human effort. RuleML descriptions are implemented by inserting them into the behavior section of METS, which is prepared for defining behaviors of <b>digital</b> <b>contents.</b> A set of rules embedded into the behavior section may designate how collection levels for target <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> are set. 1...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{information}} protection for <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> becomes {{an important issue}} for enterprise applications. To protect <b>digital</b> <b>contents,</b> various enterprise <b>digital</b> right management (E-DRM) schemes have been proposed to prevent the <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> from illegal accesses. However, the previously related schemes {{did not support the}} digital right management for multi-user environments. In addition, these schemes are insecure in some applications. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new group-oriented E-DRM scheme with reliable and flexible access policies in this paper. The proposed scheme allows multiple users to acquire the access right, which can be dynamically determined according to the enterprise policy. In addition, no one can access the <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> except authorized users. Compared with the related works, the proposed scheme is more reliable and flexible for enterprise applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} our {{design of}} a contents distribution framework that supports transparent distribution of <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> on the Internet as well as copyright protection {{of participants in the}} contents distribution value chain. Copyright protection must ensure that participants in the distribution channel get the royalties due to them and that purchasers use the contents according to usage rules. It must also prevent illegal draining of <b>digital</b> <b>contents.</b> To design a contents distribution framework satisfying the above requirements, we first present four <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> distribution models. On the basis of the suggested distribution models, we designed a contract system for distribution of royalties among participants in the contents distribution channel, a license mechanism for enforcement of contents usage to purchasers, and both a packaging mechanism and a secure client system for prevention of illegal draining of <b>digital</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R

30|$|Digital {{watermarking}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular approaches considered as a tool for providing the copyright protection of <b>digital</b> <b>contents.</b> This technique is based on direct embedding of additional information data (called watermark) into the <b>digital</b> <b>contents.</b> Ideally, there must be no perceptible difference between the watermarked and original <b>digital</b> <b>contents,</b> and the watermark should be easily extractable, reliable, and robust against data compression or any signal manipulations [1]. The main requirements of digital watermarking are invisibility, robustness, and data capacity. These requirements are mutually conflicting, and thus, in the design of a watermarking system, the tradeoff has to be made.|$|R

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth <b>Digital</b> <b>Content</b> Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E

It also allows students {{to create their own}} augmented reality learning environments and select preferences from acquired <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> based on multiple object real scenes. Mobile users are able to request contextual <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> from web service providers to augment these multiple objects in the real world. The <b>digital</b> <b>contents</b> are generally dynamically acquired digital media, e. g. 3 D models, images, textual descriptive data, metadata, multimedia or even social media data.
