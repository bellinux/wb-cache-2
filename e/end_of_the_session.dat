5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} quicker than {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton did {{go out on}} {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest time of the session, the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen went out on the harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{hit back}} in the second session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Following his crash in free practice, Rosberg's car needed to be repaired and he did not get out on track {{in the first part of}} qualifying (Q1) until nine minutes before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> He nevertheless managed to set the fastest time, more than four-tenths of a second ahead of Hamilton. Pascal Wehrlein performed well for Manor, setting the tenth fastest time, just over a second off of Rosberg's time. Just as in free practice, suspension failures occurred: First it was Sergio Pérez who nursed his car back to the pit lane. Towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> Daniil Kvyat crashed heavily following a break in his suspension in turn 7. Qualifying was red flagged as a consequence and later restarted with 1:44 minutes remaining. Nico Hülkenberg was the only driver to improve on his time, while others were prevented from improvement by Carlos Sainz Jr., who was stranded with his car off the track, causing yellow flags to be shown. Eventually, the two Sauber drivers were last, behind Kvyat and Rio Haryanto, with the two Renault cars the last to be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{first period}} of {{qualifying}} (Q1) ran for eighteen minutes and set positions seventeen to twenty-two on the grid. Nico Rosberg was the fastest at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> which saw MRT drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein eliminated in {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} place, their best qualifying performance of the season. Jenson Button qualified nineteenth, after running wide at turn 15 on his first flying lap and aborting his second after encountering traffic. Marcus Ericsson finished twentieth overall, ahead of the Renaults of Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer, who struggled {{with a lack of}} power on the circuit's long straights.|$|E

5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers {{were able to go}} out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to go out in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vettel set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} second part of {{qualifying}} as well, being two-tenths faster than second placed Daniil Kvyat.

With the session ending under yellow flags, both Force India and both McLaren drivers joined Sainz in elimination, with Nico Hülkenberg fastest in eleventh place on the grid. Everyone behind Sainz failed to finish their laps, including Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 23 April, all teams {{conducted}} in-season {{testing at}} the Circuit de Catalunya on 25–28 April {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix. Jos Verstappen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing despite spinning into the gravel early in the session, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Michael Schumacher was quickest on the second day. Michael Schumacher remained the fastest driver on the third day of testing. The session was disrupted because several drivers stopped on the circuit with problems with their cars. On the final day, (which was held in wet weather conditions in the morning and during the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session)</b> Michael Schumacher stayed the quickest driver on the final day.|$|E

5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off his call for a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> Willis called a special session to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget {{was not part of}} Willis's initial call for a special session. In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice on Friday afternoon {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E

500|$|George Martin, the band's producer, {{described}} Rubber Soul as [...] "the {{first album}} {{to present a}} new, growing Beatles to the world".

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. During first practice on Friday morning, Lewis Hamilton posted the fastest time– over a second quicker than the fastest time set in first practice in 2014– and four-tenths {{of a second}} ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg in second. Both Lotus and Force India showed good pace with Romain Grosjean and Nico Hülkenberg being third and fourth fastest respectively, though over 1.5 seconds behind Hamilton. Incidents during the session included Hamilton spinning out when his brakes locked up and Carlos Sainz Jr. stopping {{at the end of}} pit lane when he set out to post a timed lap towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. World champion Lewis Hamilton took a clean sweep and topped the time sheets {{in all three}} sessions by a considerable margin. The first session saw Lotus test driver Jolyon Palmer participate in place of regular Romain Grosjean. He finished six-tenths of a second behind his teammate Pastor Maldonado {{and was one of}} several drivers to have off track experiences during the session. Both Mercedes drivers ran wide on different parts of the track, as did Felipe Massa, who spun his Williams in turn 14 towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> Hamilton was over half a second clear of his teammate Nico Rosberg on Friday morning, with the Ferraris more than a second behind.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was eliminated due to a failure in communication, which meant he did not have enough time left for another fast lap at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> With the track still damp when qualifying began, times improved with every passing lap, with the drivers being able to switch from intermediate to slick tyres {{at the end of the}} first session. While the two Manor drivers once again qualified at the end of the grid, Jenson Button was also eliminated in Q1, leaving him with time penalties in the race, not being able to take the full extent of his 25-place grid penalty.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying, all drivers used the softer compound tyres at least for their second run of timed laps, including the Mercedes pair. While Valtteri Bottas was the last driver to switch from the medium tyres, his Williams teammate Felipe Massa needed a quick lap at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> to secure his participation in the second qualifying round, after he had been held up by compatriot Felipe Nasr earlier in the session. Fernando Alonso's McLaren broke down due to a loss of power before he was able to set a time, with teammate Jenson Button likewise unable to proceed. Both Manor Marussia drivers failed to advance, while Pastor Maldonado in fifteenth was the last driver to be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures {{in the afternoon sun}} meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, more than half a second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} on Thursday {{afternoon}} saw considerably less running than the first. A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel. During the stoppage, rain began to fall, keeping most drivers {{in the garage}} when practice was restarted. It was not until ten minutes from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> that the drivers took to the track again, but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, more than seven-tenths of a second {{in front of his}} team mate. Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively, while McLaren proved they might challenge for points as predicted, with Fernando Alonso in eighth place.|$|E
