40|$|Background: Workers are {{vulnerable}} to heat stress when they perform tasks in hot environments. Personal cooling systems (PCSs) are designed to reduce heat strain. A cooling vest with ventilation fans {{is a type of}} PCS that can blow air around the body to facilitate convective and evaporative cooling. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> for a tailor-made cooling vest designed to protect construction workers from heat stress. The performance of this newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> (Unit B) was compared with that of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> used in a commercially available cooling vest (Unit A). Method: The designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> consists of a pair of ventilation fans and a portable battery pack. A hot wire anemometer was used to measure the air flow rate of the fan. The air flow rate and work duration of different <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were compared. The sweating manikin test was conducted to further compare the cooling powers of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Result: Compared with Unit A powered by the alkaline AA battery (6 V, 2122 mAh), Unit B powered by the rechargeable lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery (7. 4 V, 4400 mAh) achieved a higher air flow rate (8 22 L/s vs. 0 - 13 L/s) and longer work duration (7. 05 h vs. 6. 22 h). The average cooling power of Unit B on the sweating manikin was 68 W, which was higher than that of Unit A (51 W). Practical applications: Results showed that the newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited higher air flow rate and cooling power. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> designed in this study will be incorporated into a tailor-made PCS for protecting workers in the heat. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

Three such schemes were applied toward retrofitting the existing Hawai‘i Institute of Geophysics buildings on University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM) campus in Honolulu.

Five jackets with small <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and closable openings were designed. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> with a flow rate of 12 l/s were placed at five different torso sites. They were examined on a sweating thermal manikin in four clothing opening conditions in a warm environment (Ta=Tmanikin= 34 °C, RH= 60 %, Va= 0. 4 m/s). Total torso cooling was increased by 137 to 251 %, and clothing total dynamic evaporative resistance was decreased by 43 to 69 %. Neither the ventilation location nor the opening design had a significant difference on total torso cooling. The ventilation location had a significant difference on localized intra-torso cooling, but not the opening design. When the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were placed at the local zone where it was ventilated, that zone underwent the highest cooling than other local zones. The study indicated that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> should be placed at the region where it required the most evaporative cooling, e. g. along the spine area and the lower back.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} been analysed for a building of around 24000 m 2 from 1978. The property is used by different businesses. The specific energy use for this property is 75 kwh/m 2  for electricity and 114  kwh/m 2  for district heating. This projects ambition is to go lower than the Norrbotten county councils specific energy objective for their real estate facilities. The specific energy objective for year 2020 is {{that the use of}} electricity should be maximum 68  kwh/m 2  and 102  kwh/m 2  for district heating.   The result of the energy audit for the biggest energy consumption users (ventilation, heat and cooling) for the property is that 56 % of the electric consumption and 15 % of the district heating demand was identified. The 56 % can be divided in different parts: 44 % ventilation, lighting 22 %, climate control equipment 16 %, cooling equipment 10 % and engine warmers 8 %. In this project 14 of 19 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are studied and the reason that all {{are not part of the}} study is lack of information. The proposal for action was determined for 10 of the 14 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> The 4 remaining <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were not possible to analyse partly because of lack of logging of energy consumption where frequency converter were used. One of the omitted units had only a fan for supply air and no heat exchanger.   For each of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> in the group of the 10 selected an analysis was made selecting the most cost effective measures of the alternatives; installing a new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> installing a frequency converter or replacing the motor of the unit.   The result of energy audit showed that adding extra insulation to the roof and upgrade of the ventilation system are recommended actions. All recommendations are estimated based on an evaluation of the power consumptions in real use denoted as average power of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b>   Proposal A suggests to install one new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> install frequency converters in  5 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and replace motors in 4 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Energy saving of electricity of these actions is 232 MWh and 174 MWh for district heating and the payback time is around 2, 7 years.   Proposal B suggests that 10 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are replaced with new ones. The energy savings of electricity will be 206 MWh and for district heating 237 MWh and the resulting payback time is about 6, 4 years.   Proposal C is adding extra insulation to the roof and this provides a very cost-effective energy saving. If the roof was insulated with 20 cm the energy saving would be about  260 MWh and the payback time would be around 1, 6 years.   If additional insulation of the roof is installed as proposed in combination with upgrade of the ventilation system, the total energy consumption saving of 15 % is achieved from  4427 MWh to about 3761 MWh depending on choice of ventilation upgrade. (Proposal A+C 3761 MWh and proposal B+C 3724 MWh).   The investment cost is around 1, 5 million kr for proposal A+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 2, 3 years. The specific electric consumption would be 65, 3  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 95  kwh/m 2.   The investment cost is around 3, 3 million kr for proposal B+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 4, 7 years. The specific electric consumption would be 66  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 93  kwh/m 2.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{study on the}} implementation of active noise and vibration control on a <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> systems radiate noise at the duct outlets and from the duct walls. In many practical applications, <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> are installed without shielding, although, they often run through corridors and adjacent rooms or halls to be ventilated.
