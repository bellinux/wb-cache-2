5|$|Cammalleri {{chose to}} forgo {{his senior year}} of eligibility, signing a {{contract}} with the Kings ahead of the 2002–03 NHL season. He attended Kings' training camp, but failed to make the roster and was assigned to the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League (AHL). He scored 14 points in nine games and earned his <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> to Los Angeles on November 7, 2002. He made his NHL debut the following night against the Ottawa Senators and earned his first point, an assist, in a 3–2 victory. His first goal came a week later, on November 16, against Tommy Salo of the Edmonton Oilers. He was demoted and recalled by the Kings twice more during the season, and appeared in a total of 28 NHL games, scoring 8 points in addition to 20 points in 13 games in the AHL before his season was ended on January 28, 2003, when he suffered a concussion in a game against the San Jose Sharks.|$|E
25|$|CAIS {{were used}} by all {{branches}} of the United States military for training in detection, handling and familiarization with chemical warfare agents between the 1930s and 1960s. The U.S. Army used CAIS to train its soldiers from 1928 until 1969. During this time period more than 100,000 CAIS units were produced by all branches of the military. CAIS were declared obsolete in 1971 and systematically recalled from military installations during two operations. The <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> operation, Operation Set Consolidation I (SETCON I), was in 1978; SETCON II followed on in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Marsh did {{not return}} to the Test team until 2014, and from 2014 until 2016 was a fringe player who has filled in for an injured top-order batsman on several occasions. His <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> was in February 2014 as a {{replacement}} for Shane Watson in the first Test of Australia's 2013–14 tour of South Africa; he scored 148 runs in his first innings, but was dropped after getting a pair in the second Test. He was recalled to the line-up in December 2014 for the home series against India after captain Michael Clarke tore his hamstring, and scored 254 runs at 42.33 in three Tests. He played both Tests in the 2015 tour of the West Indies after Chris Rogers withdrew with concussion, scoring 112 runs at 37.33. He toured with the Australian team throughout the subsequent 2015 Ashes series, playing well in tour matches but failing (with scores of 0 and 2) in the sole Test for which he was selected. He played two home Tests in 2015–16, one against New Zealand and one against the West Indies after Usman Khawaja suffered a hamstring injury, and in the match against the West Indies scored 182, the highest score of his career to date.|$|E

2500|$|Montador {{spent the}} {{majority}} of the 2001–02 season with Saint John where he scored 9 goals and 25 points in 67 games. He earned his <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> to Calgary early in the season and made his NHL debut on November 23, 2001 – and recorded his first point with an assist – against the Buffalo Sabres. Montador's first NHL goal came on January 8, 2002, against goaltender Garth Snow in a 5–2 victory over the New York Islanders, and he also played with Team Canada at the 2001 Spengler Cup. He appeared in 11 games for Calgary and recorded three points. [...] In 2002–03, Montador again began the year with Saint John where, during one early-season contest, he tied an AHL record for shots in a game with 14. [...] He was recalled to Calgary days later to replace defenceman Bob Boughner, who suffered a broken thumb. [...] Montador remained with the Flames {{for the remainder of the}} season; he recorded a goal and an assist in 50 games.|$|E

60|$|I can {{remember}} her all through her beautiful life {{for she was}} but a girl when she married, and little more when I can <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> her busy fingers and her gentle voice. I see her as a lovely woman with kind, dove's eyes, somewhat short of stature it is true, but carrying herself very bravely. In my memories of those days she is clad always in some purple shimmering stuff, with a white kerchief round her long white neck, and I see her fingers turning and darting as she works at her knitting. I see her again in her middle years, sweet and loving, planning, contriving, achieving, with the few shillings a day of a lieutenant's pay on which to support the cottage at Friar's Oak, and to keep a fair face to the world. And now, if I do but step into the parlour, I can see her once more, with over eighty years of saintly life behind her, silver-haired, placid-faced, with her dainty ribboned cap, her gold-rimmed glasses, and her woolly shawl with the blue border. I loved her young and I love her old, and when she goes she will take something with her which {{nothing in the world}} can ever make good to me again. You may have many friends, you who read this, and you may chance to marry more than once, but your mother is your first and your last. Cherish her, then, whilst you may, for the day will come when every hasty deed or heedless word will come back with its sting to hive in your own heart.|$|E

50|$|Autobiographical memory, however, is not {{impaired}} on {{a continual}} decline from the <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> {{of the information}} when anxiety is induced. At <b>first</b> <b>recall</b> attempt, the memory is fairly accurate. The impairment begins when reconsolidation is present, such that the more times the memory is brought to conscious awareness, the less accurate it will become. When stress is induced the memory will be susceptible to other influences, such as suggestions from other people, or emotions unrelated to the event but present during recall. Therefore, stress at the encoding of an event positively influences memory, but stress {{at the time of}} recollection impairs memory.|$|E
