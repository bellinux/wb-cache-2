After all these years – I'm 41 now, and really, I shouldn't be in a pop group any more, but I am and it's still my job! <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and I haven't {{got to go to}} a nine-to-five.

6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{night and}} cannot {{go to sleep}} again," [...] remarked Susan, who was {{knitting}} and reading at the same time, [...] "I pass the moments by torturing the Kaiser to death.

5000|$|Chapatte {{covered his}} last Tour de France in July 1994, abandoning {{the race in}} the Pyrenees when he fell ill. [...] "I fell asleep <b>in</b> Lourdes and <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{hospital}} in Paris," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Then {{the snake}} vanished, seeming to wriggle down the left bottom bed-post, and <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a cold sweat, my lord, {{and did what}} it had told me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Strange to say, {{in spite}} of everything, my sleep {{refreshed}} me. <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning strong and vigorous--thank goodness, I have physically a magnificent constitution--and packed my box, with Jane's help, for my Torquay expedition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, yes!" [...] cried Camilla, whose fermenting {{feelings}} {{appeared to}} rise from her legs to her bosom. [...] "It's all very true! It's a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health {{would be much better}} if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition if I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to know I posses it, when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night." [...] Here another burst of feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard {{all over}} just like that," [...] he went on. [...] "Now that's what I call clean. Every bit of flesh an' blood an' muscle is clean {{right down to}} the bones--and they're clean, too. No soap and water only on the skin, but clean all the way in. I tell you it feels clean. It knows it's clean itself. When <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning an' go to work, every drop of blood and bit of meat is {{shouting}} right out that it is clean. Oh, I tell you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lovely, lovely Ophelia!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What a {{wonderful}} power it is--poetry! <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning all bedraggled; there's a yellow fog outside; little Emily {{turns on the}} electric light when she brings me my tea, and says, 'Oh, ma'am, the water's frozen in the cistern, and cook's cut her finger to the bone.' And then I open a little green book, and the birds are singing, the stars shining, the flowers twinkling--" [...] She looked about her as if these presences had suddenly manifested themselves round her dining-room table.|$|E
50|$|I {{just dropped}} out {{sometime}} <b>in</b> 1971, when <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Donwood Clinic, a rehab centre in Toronto, {{with no idea}} how I got there, weighing 128 lbs and looking like a ghost in my six-foot frame.|$|R

25|$|My name is Sam Tyler. I had an {{accident}} and <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1973. Am <b>I</b> mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now, maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{nothing to}} be done," [...] exclaimed Camilla, [...] "but comply and depart. It's {{something}} to have seen the object of one's love and duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined {{not to make a}} display of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one's relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The bare idea!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{smoke in}} bed until I {{have to go}} to sleep; <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, {{sometimes}} once, sometimes twice; sometimes three times, and I never waste any of these opportunities to smoke. This habit is so old and dear and precious to me that I would feel as you, sir, would feel if you should lose the only moral you've got--meaning the chairman--if you've got one: I am making no charges: I will grant, here, that I have stopped smoking now and then, for a few months at a time, but it was not on principle, it was only to show off; it was to pulverize those critics who said I was a slave to my habits and couldn't break my bonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Sometimes I think I'll be all right--and then I get horribly afraid. We've studied {{hard and}} Miss Stacy has drilled us thoroughly, but we mayn't get through for all that. We've each got a {{stumbling}} block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane's is Latin, and Ruby and Charlie's is algebra, and Josie's is arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon {{says he feels}} it in his bones {{that he is going}} to fail in English history. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we'll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we'll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night and wonder what I'll do if I don't pass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been playing}} in hard luck. I {{went down to}} New York and one night when I was in a sailors' {{boarding}} house I drank more than was good for me, and when <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning <b>I</b> found myself on a vessel bound for Africa." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{said this}} in a nonfiction book, and I’ll repeat it {{at the risk of}} quoting myself: when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Halifax or Nova Scotia, there is a shorter {{distance}} between my unconscious life and my conscious life than anywhere else, I feel more complete and more whole."

"The {{weather has}} been real cold," [...] she wrote, [...] "so I let the cats {{sleep in the}} house--Rusty and Joseph on the sofa in the living-room, and the Sarah-cat on the foot of my bed. It's real company to hear her purring when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night and think of my poor {{daughter}} in the foreign field. If it was anywhere but in India I wouldn't worry, but they say the snakes out there are terrible. It takes all the Sarah-cats's purring to drive away the thought of those snakes. I have enough faith for everything but the snakes. I can't think why Providence ever made them. Sometimes I don't think He did. I'm inclined to believe the Old Harry {{had a hand in}} making THEM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{walked the}} shore for months after that," [...] he said sadly, [...] "looking {{to find her}} dear, sweet little body, but the sea never gave her back to me. But I'll find her sometime. I wisht I could tell you just how she looked but I can't. I've seen a fine silvery mist hanging over the Gate at sunrise that seemed like her--and then again I've seen a white birch in the woods back yander that {{made me think of}} her. She had pale brown hair and a little white face, and long slender fingers like yours, Mary, only browner, for she was a shore girl. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night and hear the sea calling to me in the old way and it seems as if lost Margaret called in it. And when there's a storm and the waves are sobbing and moaning I hear her lamenting among them. And when they laugh on a gay day it's her laugh--lost Margaret's sweet little laugh. The sea took her from me but some day I'll find her, Mary. It can't keep us apart forever." ...|$|E

"I can't {{remember}} anything definitely until <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> that chapel," [...] Graham continued, [...] "but when they searched me {{and found that}} the pocketbook had gone, Fischer, the big American, muttered some woman's name.

6000|$|... "I couldn't bear to have Walter go," [...] she wrote. [...] "I love Jem ever so {{much but}} Walter means {{more to me}} than anyone in the world and I would die if he had to go. He seems so changed these days. He hardly ever talks to me. I suppose he wants to go, too, and feels badly because he can't. He doesn't go about with Jem and Jerry at all. I shall never forget Susan's face when Jem came home in his khaki. It worked and twisted as if she were going to cry, but all she said was, 'You look almost like a man in that, Jem.' Jem laughed. He never minds because Susan thinks him just a child still. Everybody seems busy but me. I wish there was {{something}} I could do but there doesn't seem to be anything. Mother and Nan and Di are busy all the time and I just wander about like a lonely ghost. What hurts me terribly, though, is that mother's smiles, and Nan's, just seem put on from the outside. Mother's eyes never laugh now. It makes me feel that I shouldn't laugh either--that it's wicked to feel laughy. And it's so hard for me to keep from laughing, even if Jem {{is going to be a}} soldier. But when I laugh I don't enjoy it either, as I used to do. There's something behind it all that keeps hurting me--especially when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. Then I cry because I am afraid that Kitchener of Khartoum is right and the war will last for years and Jem may be--but no, I won't write it. It would make me feel as if it were really going to happen. The other day Nan said, 'Nothing can ever be quite the same for any of us again.' It made me feel rebellious. Why shouldn't things be the same again--when everything is over and Jem and Jerry are back? We'll all be happy and jolly again and these days will seem just like a bad dream.|$|E
6000|$|One almost infallibly begins--at {{least the}} perpetually {{criminal}} I do--with {{the assurance that}} one has, from long since, been on the point--! And it remains eternally true; which makes no difference, however, in your being bored to hear it. Besides, if I had been writing a month ago I shouldn't, perhaps, be writing now; and that I am writing now is a present joy to me--which I would barter for none other, no mere luxury of conscience. I haven't, for weeks, strolled through my now blighted and stricken jardinet without reverting gratefully in thought to you as its titular directress; without wishing, at once, that it were more worthy of you, and recognising, recalling your hand and mind, in most of its least humiliating features. Your kind visit, so scantly honoured, so meagrely recorded (I mean by commemorative tablet, or other permanent demonstration,) lives again {{in some of the}} faded phenomena of the scene--and the blush revives which the sense of how poor a host I was caused even then to visit my cheek. I want you in particular to know what a joy and pride your great proud and pink tobacco-present has proved. It has overlorded the confused and miscellaneous border in which your masterly eye recognised its imperative--not to say imperial--place, and it has reduced by its mere personal success all the incoherence around it to comparative insignificance. What a bliss, what a daily excitement, all summer, to see it grow by leaps and bounds and to feel it happy and hearty--as much as it could be in its strange exile and inferior company. It has all prospered--though some a little smothered by more vulgar neighbours; and the tallest of the brotherhood are still as handsome as ever, with a particular shade of watered wine-colour in the flower that I much delight in. And yet--niny that I am!--I don't {{know what to do with}} them for next year. My gardener opines that we leave them, as your perennial monument, just as they are. But I have vague glimmerings of conviction that we cut them down to a mere small protrusion above ground--and we probably both are fully wrong. Or do we extract precious seed and plant afresh? Forgive my feeble (I repeat) flounderings. I feel as the dunce of an infant school trying to babble Greek to Professor Jebb (or suchlike.) I am none the less hoping that the garden will be less dreadful and casual next year. We've ordered 105 roses--also divers lilies--and made other vague dashes. Oh, you should be in controlling permanence! Actually we are painfully preparing to become bulbous and parti-coloured. One must occupy the gardener. The grapes have been bad (bless their preposterous little pretensions!) but the figs unprecedently numerous. And so on, and so on. And it has been for me a rather feverish and accidenté summer; I mean through the constant presence of family till a month ago, and through a prolonged domestic upheaval ever since. I sit amid the ruins of a once happy household, clutching a charwoman with one hand, and a knife-boy--from Lilliput--with the other. A man and his wife, who had lived with me for long, long years, and were (in spite of growing infirmities and the darker and darker shadow of approaching doom) the mainstay of my existence, were sacrificed to the just gods three or four weeks ago, and I've picnicked (for very relief) ever since--making futile attempts at reconstruction for which I have had no time, and yet which have consumed so much of it that none has been left, as I began by hinting, for correspondence. I've been up to London over it, and haunted Hastings, and wired to friends, and almost appealed to the Grand Governess--only deterred by the fear of hearing from her that it isn't her province. Yet I did wonder if I couldn't lawfully work it in under kitchen-garden. No matter; my fate closes round me again, and the first thing I think of now when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is that a [...] "cook-housekeeper" [...] in a Gorringe (?) costume (?) is to arrive next week. I tremble at her. If the worst comes to the worst I shall make you responsible. I walked over to Winchelsea this afternoon and returned, in darkness and wet, by the far-off station and the merciful train--always re-weaving the legend of your wet exile there. It blows, it rains, it rages to-night--for the first time here for six months. I hope you haven't had again to eat overmuch the bread of banishment. I haven't asked you for your news--have only jabbered my own; but I believe you not unaware that this is but a subtler art for extracting from you the whole of your herbaceous (and other) history. May it have been mild and merciful. Good-night--or, as usual, good-morning--I am going to bed, but it has been for some time to-morrow. Yours, dear Miss Muir Mackenzie, very gratefully and faithfully, ...|$|E
