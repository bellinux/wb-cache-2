2500|$|Mining work at Greenside (that is, driving levels, sumps and rises, {{and winning}} ore from the stopes) was {{done during the}} nineteenth century by groups of miners who formed {{partnerships}} and worked as independent contractors. Contracts (known as [...] "bargains") for particular jobs were let once a quarter to the group bidding the lowest rate per fathom, and were paid {{at the end of the}} quarter according to the amount of work that had been done. <b>Interim</b> <b>payments</b> of £2 per man (called [...] "lent money") were made at the end of the first and second months. These were then deducted, along with the costs of candles, gunpowder and the sharpening of tools, from the payment at the end of the quarter. On average each miner earned 16 to 18 shillings per week under this system. Until 1837 the quarterly payments were made at the Angel Inn in Penrith. The whole workforce travelled into the town, and £1,600 might be paid out in cash.|$|E
60|$|Now {{and then}} for several days {{together}} we sat in our log-built shelter while a blinding snowstorm raged outside and the pines filled the valley with their roaring. Then there were weeks of bitter frost, when work was partly suspended, and both rock and soil defied our efforts. One of our best horses died and another fell over a precipice. Hay was hardly to be bought with money, provisions only at an exorbitant cost, and though we received a few <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> it was, as Johnston said, even chances either way if we kept on top, because every day of enforced idleness cost us many dollars. However, floundering through snow-slush, swinging the axe in driving sleet and rain, or hauling the mossy logs through the mire of a sudden thaw, we persisted in our task, though often at nights we sat inside the shanty, which was filled with steaming garments, counting the cost, {{in a state of}} gloomy despondency. Except for the thought of Grace, there were moments when I might have yielded; but we were always an obstinate race, and seeing that I was steadfastly determined to hold out to the last, the others gallantly aided me. Now, when the time of stress is past, I know how much I owe to their loyalty.|$|E

40|$|Cash flow {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} essential tools toward assessing the distribution of expenditure and revenues of construction projects with respect to the time of the project. The work presented in this paper aims to find out the minimum fund required for cash outflow in case of delay in payments and to identify contractual implications and consequences due to failure of meeting planned cash flow on both the owner and the contractor. Data from record files of 25 villas, in Muscat, Oman, with different sizes was analysed to identify the minimum fund required with the contractor to maintain the progress of work in-case of delay of <b>interim</b> <b>payments.</b> The analysis also included identification of consequences of delay of <b>interim</b> <b>payments.</b> It was found that the minimum fund required is 8. 5 per cent of the contract value for maximum interim payment delay of four weeks. The value of required minimum fund increases as the period of delay increases. In most cases the percentage of the required minimum fund increases with the increase of the contract value. Work stoppage, delay in completion, penalties and incompletion of projects are major consequences of delay on <b>interim</b> <b>payments...</b>|$|E

40|$|There is {{a gap in}} tort {{recovery}} for many hazardous release victims. Hazardous spill victims receive different damage compensation based solely upon the type of hazardous substance released, with oil spill victims benefitting {{from a number of}} statutory damage recovery mechanisms that victims of other type of hazardous substance releases do not receive. Specifically, those injured by oil spills receive <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> and recover for their economic loss. Yet, many victims injured by non-oil hazardous spills will incur economic harm but will not receive compensation because of a prohibition on {{recovery for}} economic loss absent accompanying physical injury or private property damage. That prohibition on recovery, known as the “pure economic loss rule,” serves as an effective bar to recovery for most spill victims because hazardous releases often damage public natural resources (such as water) rather than private property.

This study investigates {{the extent of the}} payment problem and possible solutions that could mitigate payment risks on construction projects. An online questionnaire survey was administered to contractors, subcontractors and consultants for their opinions on the issue.

40|$|Building {{contractors}} are generally small private firms. Bank loans are their major, if not only, source of external finance. However, {{building and construction}} loans represent a mere minuscule portion of all bank loans in Hong Kong, suggesting that contractors may have been neglected by banks. With the case of Hong Kong, this study examines the lack {{of supply and demand}} of construction finance, and the implications for industry competition and innovation. Contractors' perceptions were solicited through a questionnaire survey. Key issues identified were further explored in subsequent interviews. The results were then triangulated with secondary data. It is found that although contractors do not usually have enough assets to pledge as collateral, they generally do not need to borrow that much. The provision of <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> has enabled them to work with small capital outlay. However, the interim payment mechanism has induced a low barrier to entry, which has helped perpetuate the vicious circle of labour intensiveness of building construction, exploitation of labour-only subcontracting, proliferation of small subcontractors and intense rivalry between firms. The findings conclude that contractors' limited access to finance generally and bank loans in particular has posed a major barrier to innovation and hence industry development.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the inter‐relationship between profitability, {{cost of capital}} and capital structure among property developers and contractors in Hong Kong. Whilst major indigenous local developers are among the largest and the most profitable in the world, their contractor counterparts are generally small and nowhere near as profitable. An analysis of financial data suggests that gearing is generally higher among contractors than developers. However, {{it does not mean}} that contractors borrow more than developers. Indeed they do not need to borrow as much as developers even if they have the assets to pledge as collateral. Contractors do not have to pay for high land costs, and they obtain project finance from developers through <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> in lump sum contracts that are widely adopted in the industry. Their high gearing reflects more their low equity base than high level of debts. Their costs of equities are about double the developers’, probably due to their usually low or negative profit margins. This conclusion is substantiated by further regression analysis of the data. The findings indicate that capital gearing is positively related with asset but negatively with profit margins. This article concludes with a discussion on implications of such profitability divide between the two sectors on the unequal relationship between developers and contractors, and on their competitiveness.
