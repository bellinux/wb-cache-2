500|$|According to Abu Bakr, {{speaking}} to Al Hayatt in 2002, Abu Nidal {{said he was}} behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988; a former head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines was later convicted. Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: [...] "We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own hands!" [...] Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it; one of Abu Nidal's associates told him, [...] "If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe, Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret (Annette Crosbie) {{is having}} a heated {{telephone}} conversation with a solicitor about an incident in which Victor is accused of having thrown a syringe into someone's buttock. She reveals that a conviction might be difficult as her husband has been dead for five months. While {{coming to terms with}} her husband's death as a hit and run victim, Margaret joins a church group clearing litter from roadsides. There she meets Glynis Holloway (Hannah Gordon), whose husband has also recently died. The two become good friends. Confiding to a priest, Father Blakey (William Osborne), Margaret pledges vengeance for Victor's death, vowing [...] "If they ever find the bastard who was at the wheel of that car I swear I'll kill <b>him,</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> bare hands if I have to, and they can do what they like with me". Father Blakey tells Margaret of his hope that one day she finds the strength to forgive the person responsible.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{the little}} man with his long hair and Emersonian face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> hand—Mommsen!—think of it! ... I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was clothed in a titanic {{deceptive}} modesty which {{made him look like}} other men.|$|E
60|$|I marched {{along in}} front of <b>'im</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> 'ead in the air, and {{when he spoke to}} me I didn't answer him. He went aboard the ship {{when we got to the}} wharf, and a minute or two arterwards 'e came to the side and said the skipper wanted to see me.|$|R
60|$|I thanked <b>him</b> <b>with</b> all <b>my</b> heart, {{for it was}} {{friendly}} in him to offer to take that trouble.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} him in broken words; my heart, I think I must have told <b>him,</b> lay <b>with</b> <b>my</b> dead parents.|$|R
2500|$|As Lee's army {{stood in}} entrenchments behind Totopotomoy Creek, they were short on men. Lee {{requested}} that General P.G.T. Beauregard send him reinforcements from his 12,000-man army, sitting relatively idle as they bottled up Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's army at Bermuda Hundred. Beauregard initially refused Lee's request, citing the potential threat from Butler. Lee was determined despite this disappointment. He wrote to President Davis, [...] "If General Grant advances tomorrow I will engage <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> present force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee's {{army was}} in {{precarious}} shape as it stood in entrenchments behind Totopotomoy Creek. Although the cavalry action at Haw's Shop had given Lee valuable intelligence that indicated Grant's avenue of approach, the Confederates were short on supplies, {{due to the}} Union disruption of the Virginia Central Railroad. They were also short on men. Lee requested that General P.G.T. Beauregard send him reinforcements from his 12,000-man army, sitting relatively idle as they bottled up Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's army at Bermuda Hundred. Beauregard initially refused Lee's request, citing the potential threat from Butler. Lee was determined despite this disappointment, and despite the persistence of his recent dysentery at North Anna. He wrote to President Davis, [...] "If General Grant advances tomorrow I will engage <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> present force." [...] (On May 30, appeals to Confederate President Jefferson Davis caused Beauregard to relent and send 7,000 men, the division of Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke, to join Lee.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In another article, Fitzpatrick told of {{his work}} with a student who had been [...] "horribly crippled" [...] from birth. [...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I will teach you to walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day I taught him. [...] I showed him how to step and helped <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> hands to take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E

2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E
