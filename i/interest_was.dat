One of the artists tipped early on as a possible candidate was DJ Armin van Buuren, who announced in June 2013 that he was open to participating at the contest as long as AVROTROS gave him full artistic freedom and abandoned plans for a national final to select the entry. Shirma Rouse, one of the backing singers for Anouk at the 2013 contest, was another candidate mentioned after being promoted by Anouk at several events in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although as a British subject Singh's primary <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> women's {{rights in}} England, {{she and her}} fellow suffragettes also {{promoted}} similar activities in the colonies. She valued her Indian heritage, but was not bound by allegiance to a single nation and supported the women's cause {{in a number of}} countries. Her title, Princess, was useful. Singh sold a suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court Palace, where Queen Victoria had allowed her family to live. According to a letter from Lord Crewe, King George V was within his rights to have her evicted.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his artistic}} talents, Kim's main <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> medicine, and {{he applied for}} {{entrance}} into medical school upon graduation {{from high school in}} 1940. When he failed to gain admittance, Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and save up money to reapply for medical school. The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim often went to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their influence was to show in his mature film style.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{opposition}} from the Knights of Labor who eventually became supporters, on January 23, 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation to create a Board of Park Commissioners, and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3, 1883. Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission's first president. He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning because a property in which he held financial <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> under park board consideration.|$|E

He ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of}} the government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{retreat from}} Quebec, {{and in this}} battle, wounded {{soldiers}} were treated at the Ursuline convent in Trois-Rivières. Congress never authorized payment for these services and the convent has retained the bill. By the early 21st century, the original bill of about £26 {{was estimated to be}} equivalent to between ten and twenty million Canadian dollars, if compound <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> applied. On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David Fetter symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E

This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 the zoo gained {{yet more}} {{military}} credentials when king penguin Nils Olav {{was adopted by}} the Norwegian King's Guard. Norway's connection with Edinburgh's penguins began with the Salvesen family's links to the zoo, and renewed <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> sparked when a lieutenant called Nils Egelien visited the zoo with the King's Guard in 1961. On his return in 1972 Egelien arranged for the unit to adopt one of the penguins. Nils Olav was named after Egelien and in honour of King Olav V of Norway, and given the rank of lance corporal.

5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary <b>interest</b> <b>was</b> an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E

In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game.

His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
