60|$|The Boma {{factories}} are {{like those of}} Porto da Lenha, but humbler in size, and more resembling the wicker-work native houses. The river, which up stream will show a <b>flood</b> <b>mark</b> of twelve feet, here seldom rises above five, and further down three and four; consequently piles are not required, and the swiftness of the current keeps off the jacaré. Formerly there were fourteen establishments, which licit trade in palm oil and ground-nuts, instead of men, women, and children, have reduced to ten. The air is sensibly drier and healthier than at the lower settlement, and apparently there is nothing against the place but deadly ennui and monotony.|$|E
60|$|Bob was in raptures {{with the}} new 'ship-yard.' It was {{as large as the}} {{mainsail}} of a ship of four hundred tons, was complete as to shade, with the advantage of letting the breeze circulate, and had a reasonable chance of escaping from the calamities of a <b>flood.</b> <b>Mark,</b> too, was satisfied with the result, and the very next day after this task was completed, our shipwrights set to work to lay their keel. That day was memorable on another account. Bob had gone to the Summit in quest of a tool left there, in fitting up the boat of Mark, and while on the mount, he ascertained the important fact that the melons were beginning to ripen. He brought down three or four of these delicious fruits, and Mark had the gratification of tasting some of the bounties of Providence, which had been bestowed, as a reward of his own industry and forethought. It was necessary to eat of these melons in moderation, however; but it was a great relief to get them at all, after subsisting for so long a time on salted meats, principally, with no other vegetables but such as were dry, and had been long in the ship. It was not the melons alone, however, that were getting to be ripe; for, on examining himself, among the vines which now covered fully an acre of the Summit, Mark found squashes, cucumbers, onions, sweet-potatoes, tomatoes, string-beans, and two or three other vegetables, all equally fit to be used. From that time, some of these plants were put into the pot daily, and certain slight apprehensions which Woolston had begun again to entertain on the subject of scurvy, were soon dissipated. As for the garden within the crater, which was much the most extensive and artistical, it was somewhat behind that on the Summit, having been later tilled; but everything, there, looked equally promising, and Mark saw that one acre, well worked, would produce more than he and Betts could consume in a twelvemonth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{commonly}} accepted that absolute immunity from flood damage is not physically possible {{even in the}} distant future because of unpredictability of several natural forces which might cause unprecedented situation. Even so, with proper planning and continuous effort we can certainly look forward to an appreciable diminution of distress with an accelerated implementation of flood management measures. It {{is commonly}} accepted that the measures to mitigate flood losses need {{to be given the}} most efforts wherein flood damage assessment is the primary measure of mitigation. This has been viewed mainly as a physical method of protection from floods. To make the measures to mitigate flood losses, it first needs to effectively measure the flood influence in which flooded area and height may be the most desired measures for each of typhoon-induced flood events. On the other hand, sophisticated hydraulic modeling tools are now available to help us estimate the scale of we face from typhoon-induced flooding from a computational perspective. The flood scale in terms of area and height of typhoon-induced flood events may be the major contribution to feedback for the calibration of those sophisticated hydraulic modeling tools. Thus, a <b>flood</b> <b>mark</b> recording device is highly required to be re-examined for its use in such an increasing demand. It’s commonly accepted that a new generation of device should put economic, environmental, simple and practica...|$|E

40|$|In case of {{wide and}} {{built-up}} flood plains, 2 D modelling {{is necessary to}} obtain a convenient view of the flows during flooding. The complexity of these flows requires possible modelling of supercritical and specific representation of hydraulic structures. Uncertainty of the results remain high because of hazardous events as dike breaching or {{because of lack of}} data such as the local rainfall. Calibration is usually performed by adjusting calculated peak water levels to flood marks. Information about extent of the flooded area or time of arrival or any other information should also be used to reduce uncertainty. Two flood events, the 1999 flood of the coastal Agly river flood plain and the 1988 flood in the city of Nîmes are described. On the first event, results of the calibration accuracy are provided in term of average deviation; locally, the difference between calculated peak water level and corresponding <b>flood</b> <b>mark</b> is high because the description of the flood plain {{does not take into account}} the buildings in a detailed way and because the influence of infiltration and other secondary processes could not be modelled. On the second example, representing a dense built-up area, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the parameters that may explain local differences in spite of the representation of the buildings. Higher uncertainty seems to come from the topography including description of the possible storage areas, from flow and rainfall inputs and from specific hazardous events (car blockage or any event due to fixed or mobile obstacle) ...|$|E
40|$|Inundation {{and fire}} {{can affect the}} {{structure}} of riparian vegetation in wetlands. Our aim was to verify if {{there are differences in}} richness, abundance, basal area, composition and topographic preference of woody species in riparian forests related to the fire history, flooding duration, or the interaction between both. The study was conducted in the riparian forests of the Paraguay River some of which were burned three times between 2001 and 2011. We sampled trees with a girth of at least 5 cm at breast height in 150 5 × 10 m plots (79 burned and 71 unburned). We also measured height of the <b>flood</b> <b>mark</b> and estimated the flooding duration of each plot. We performed Generalized Linear Mixed Models to verify differences in richness, basal area, and abundance of individuals associated to interaction of fire and inundation. We used an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and indicator species analysis to identify differences in composition of species and the association with burned and unburned area according to different levels of inundation. Finally, we used a hierarchical set of Generalized Linear Models (GLM), the so-called HOF models, to analyse each species' specific response to inundation based on topography and to determine their preferred optimal topographic position for both burned as well as unburned areas. Richness was positively associated with elevation only in burned areas while abundance was negatively influenced by inundation only in burned areas. Basal area was negatively associated with time of inundation independent of fire history. There were 15 species which were significant indicators for at least one combination of the studied factors. We found nine species in burned areas and 15 in unburned areas, with response curves in HOF models along the inundation gradient. From these, five species shifted their optimal position along the inundation gradient in burned areas. The interaction of fire and inundation did not appear to affect the basal area, but it did affect the richness, number of individuals, success of some species, and seemed to shape the boundary of these forests as shown by the difference in the positioning of these species along the inundation gradient...|$|E
