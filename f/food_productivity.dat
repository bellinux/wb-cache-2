50|$|Socially engaged Buddhism has {{developed}} in Buddhism in the West. While some critics assert {{the term is}} redundant, as it is mistaken to believe that Buddhism {{in the past has}} not affected and been affected by the surrounding society, others have suggested that Buddhism is sometimes seen as too passive toward public life. This is particularly true in the West, where almost all converts to Buddhism come to it outside of an existing family or community tradition. Engaged Buddhism is an attempt to apply Buddhist values to larger social problems, including war and environmental concerns. The term was coined by Thich Nhat Hanh, during his years as a peace activist in Vietnam. The Buddhist Peace Fellowship was founded in 1978 by Robert Aitken, Anne Aitken, Nelson Foster, and others and received early assistance from Gary Snyder, Jack Kornfield, and Joanna Macy. Another engaged Buddhist group is the Zen Peacemaker Order, founded in 1996 by Bernie Glassman and Sandra Jishu Holmes.In 2007, the American Buddhist scholar-monk, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, was invited to write an editorial essay for the Buddhist magazine Buddhadharma. In his essay, he called attention to the narrowly inward focus of American Buddhism, which has been pursued to the neglect of the active dimension of Buddhist compassion expressed through programs of social engagement. Several of Ven. Bodhi’s students who read the essay felt a desire to follow up on his suggestions. After a few rounds of discussions, they resolved to form a Buddhist relief organization dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the poor and disadvantaged in the developing world. At the initial meetings, seeking a point of focus, they decided to direct their relief efforts at the problem of global hunger, especially by supporting local efforts by those in developing countries to achieve self-sufficiency through improved <b>food</b> <b>productivity.</b> Contacts were made with leaders and members of other Buddhist communities in the greater New York area, and before long Buddhist Global Relief emerged as an inter-denominational organization comprising people of different Buddhist groups who share the vision of a Buddhism actively committed to the task of alleviating social and economic suffering.|$|E

If it were left unto every constituency and their respective communities to manage his own affairs, Belingogo would have had nothing to worry about since they have all the necessary human sector needed for any development. They have professional managers who have all the required skills in managing any available human resource, always ready to exercise self supervision, self monitoring and evaluations, self-discipline, honesty, dedication and hard work. They got also, reliable accountants who are well equip with banking skills with four to five years working experience who also apply to its fullest, modern system of banking securities as well as safety from internet fraudsters. Engineering is not left out in Belingogo as it is the backbone for the development of any nation, there are engineers in the community who underwent several years of intensive studies in the engineering field who apply safety techniques in their work, are able to apply what they have learned in their daily activities. For the seek of safety and reliability in electrical wiring, people travel all the way from Garu and many other places to fetch electricians from Belingogo to do their wiring for them simply because of the exceptional experience those electrical engineers in the community got.

In fact,as the whole world solely depends on Agriculture for its food stuff, some of the youth were advised to study much into agriculture to boots <b>food</b> <b>productivity</b> to help reduce poverty and hunger and they paid heed to exactly that. The people in this community scarcely ran into a lost during any farming season because of the reports and advice on climate changes, weather forecast and rainfall pattern that they receives from their own produced agricultural engineers. Belingogo has a meaningful record to write home about when to talk of health sector workers. There are public Nurses in the community who give assistance to all and sundry by teaching them how to prevent some silent killer diseases like cholera, malaria, yellow fever and many more. They teaches how to keep the environment clean and free from disease causing organisms like housefly and mosquitoes. The mentally challenged are not left behind as they have psychiatric nurses who are specialized in that field to take care of them without any calamities. In the recent calls of the youth in the community on the District assembly to provide extra sources of water, as well as the government's fulfillment on his earlier promise and commitment to providing good drinking water for all, two additional boreholes were provided to the people in the community in June, 2013 and January 2016 respectively. This move for development has in diverse ways helped improve the health of the people as well as the reduction of long hours that women, boys and girls used to spend on long queues at the expense of doing other assignments just to wait for their turn to access drinking water.|$|E

40|$|The {{global economy}} {{produces}} energy from two sources: a polluting nonrenewable resource and a renewable resource. Transforming crude energy into ready-to-use energy services requires costly processes {{and more efficient}} energy transformation rates are more costly to achieve. Renewable energy is in competition with food production for land acreage but the <b>food</b> <b>productivity</b> rate of land can also be improved at some cost.

In the interesting case where the economy would be constrained by the carbon cap at least temporarily, we show the following. When {{the economy is not}} constrained by the cap, the efficiency rates of energy transformation increase steadily until the transition toward the ultimate green economy; when renewable energy is exploited, its land acreage rises at the expense of food production; <b>food</b> <b>productivity</b> increases together with the land rent but food production drops; the prices of useful energy and food increase and renewables substitute for non-renewable energy.
