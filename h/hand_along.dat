In their attempt to create powerful soldiers, NESTS kidnapped K′ and injected him with DNA from the fighter Kyo Kusanagi, giving him his pyrokinetic skills. Unlike Kyo, K' is only able to create fire from his right hand, which he is sometimes unable to control. He wears a glove to protect his body from being burned accidentally. During the program, NESTS repressed K′s memories, and he was made {{to believe that he}} was Krizalid's clone. While in NESTS, K′ became enraged with how the organization played with human lives, and escaped to recover his memories. As he could not even remember his name, K' decided to destroy NESTS in order to stop their experiments. K's fighting style is simply called Pure Violence which involves him using the fire from his right <b>hand</b> <b>along</b> with martial arts moves.|$|E
