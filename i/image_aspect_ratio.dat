The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an RGB color model; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of luminance (Y) and chrominance (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1500 and 2300Hz, corresponding to the intensity (brightness) of the color component. The modulation is analog, so even though the horizontal resolution is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1200Hz horizontal synchronization pulse of 5 milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the synchronization pulse lies {{in the middle of}} the line.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Swedish cinematographer Rune Ericson collaborated with Panavision {{on the concept}} of {{creating}} a 3-perf mechanism for motion picture cameras. 3-perf minimized the problem of wasted film by changing the camera gate and shutter mechanism so that each frame is 3 perforations high instead of the standard 4-perforations. The 3-perf <b>image's</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is roughly 1.78:1, which makes it both ideal for widescreen television and very close to 1.85:1 without losing any image outside this area to waste. Because of the smaller frame, the camera effectively runs 25% slower, yielding 25% savings on film stock; the camera will run more quietly because less film is moved through the camera per frame; and the Super 35 variant allows for a larger negative area, which can help compensate for increased grain when using higher-speed film stocks.|$|R

To determine visual importance of pixels, existing re-targeting schemes mostly rely on grayscale intensity gradient maps.

In this paper, we present a computationally efficient, noise robust re-targeting scheme based on seam carving by using saliency maps that assign higher importance to visually prominent whole regions (and not just edges). This is achieved by computing global saliency of pixels using intensity as well as color features. Our saliency maps easily avoid artifacts that conventional seam carving generates and are more robust {{in the presence of}} noise. Also, unlike gradient maps, which may have to be recomputed several times during a seam carving based re-targeting operation, our saliency maps are computed only once independent of the number of seams added or removed.

50|$|The {{reason for}} DSLR's image sensors being the flatter 3:2 versus the taller point-and-shoot 4:3 is that DSLRs were {{designed}} to match the legacy 35 mm SLR film, whereas the majority of digital cameras {{were designed to}} match the predominant computer displays of the time, with VGA, SVGA, XGA and UXGA all being 4:3. Widescreen computer monitors did not become popular until the advent of HDTV, which uses a 16:9 <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, the 35 mm {{equivalent}} {{focal length}} is based on equal diagonal angle of view. This definition also in the CIPA guideline DCG-001. Alternatively, it may sometimes be based on horizontal angle of view. Since 35 mm film is normally used for <b>images</b> with an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> (width-to-height ratio) of 3:2, while many digital cameras have a 4:3 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> which have different diagonal-to-width ratios, these two definitions are often not equivalent.|$|R

Captured data is recorded to either flash or hard drives, notably the sTwo data recorder.|$|R

50|$|The {{emphasis}} on the 4:3 <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> sets Four Thirds apart from other DSLR systems, which usually adhere to the 3:2 aspect ratio of the traditional 35mm format. However, the standard only specifies the sensor diagonal, thus Four Thirds cameras using the standard 3:2 aspect ratio would be possible; notably newer Panasonic Micro Four Thirds models even offer shooting at multiple aspect ratios while maintaining the same image diagonal. For instance, the Panasonic GH1 uses a multi-aspect sensor designed to maximize use of the image circle at 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9; each ratio having a diagonal of 22.5 mm.|$|E

50|$|Building on the multi-aspect ratio sensor concept, the HD video capable GH1 was {{designed}} around {{a much larger}} four thirds sized sensor (about four times more area); a unique 14.0 megapixel (12.1 megapixel effective) Live MOS sensor. The 14 megapixel multi-aspect image ratio GH1 sensor {{was designed}} to cover a slightly larger image circle than the native 4:3 <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of its 12.1 megapixel cousin in the G1. This means that the GH1 14 megapixel sensor was capable of recording images in user selectable, native aspect ratios of 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9 with no cropping, and more importantly, the same angle of view and maximization of pixel count in any particular format.|$|E
5000|$|Most other {{digital cameras}} achieve {{different}} image aspect ratios by cropping the {{image from the}} native sensor format. For example, most digital cameras with native 4:3 <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> sensors crop the native image {{on the top and}} the bottom to achieve either 3:2 or 16:9 images. On the other hand, most DSLRs crop their 3:2 native <b>image</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> on the top and the bottom to achieve 16:9, or in some cases, crop the 3:2 native image on either side to achieve 4:3 images. [...] In fact, the GH1 sensor is never used to its full capacity for 14 megapixels, but for any of the three formats, as much of the sensor is used as possible, and more importantly, each image has the same point of view. For example, when cropping images from a native format, such as a 4:3 image, the point of view changes slightly, and a lot of pixels are lost, close to 25% when cropping a 16:9 image out of a 4:3 native format image. The multi-aspect ratio sensor cuts down on the loss of pixels so the pixel count for each aspect ratio is as close to 12 megapixels as possible. The multi-aspect ratio also allows more usable lens image depending on the format. For example, in a native 4:3 format, the image width is 4000 pixels, but in a native 16:9 format, the image width is 4352 pixels or about 8% wider. With a multi-aspect imager, the net effect is that any given lens has a slightly wider field of view in either native 3:2 or 16:9 when compared to the native 4:3 image format, as demonstrated by the table below.|$|E
