He got many thumps and bumps, but he didn't mind these, for little by little he was {{learning}} how {{to hang on to}} the branches once he got up in them. Then one day, just by accident, he put one hand against the trunk of a young pine-tree, and when he started to take it away, he found it stuck fast. He had to pull to get it free. Like a flash an idea popped into his head. He rubbed a little of the pitch, for that was what had made his <b>hand</b> <b>stick,</b> on both hands, and then he started to climb a tree. As long as the pitch lasted, he could climb.|$|E

6000|$|After {{a little}} time the Mist cleared away but still there were large Clouds about {{attracted}} by old Ben to a certain distance so as to form as it appeared large dome curtains which kept sailing about, opening and shutting at intervals {{here and there and}} everywhere: so that although we did not see one vast wide extent of prospect all round we saw something perhaps finer--these cloud-veils opening with a dissolving motion and showing us the mountainous region beneath as through a loophole--these cloudy loopholes ever varying and discovering fresh prospect east, west, north and south. Then it was misty again, and again it was fair--then puff came a cold breeze of wind and bared a craggy chap we had not yet seen though in close neighbourhood. Every now and then we had overhead blue Sky clear and the sun pretty warm. I do not know whether I can give you an Idea of the prospect from a large Mountain top. You are on a stony plain which of course makes you forget you are on any but low ground--the horizon or rather edges of this plain being above 4000 feet above the Sea hide all the Country immediately beneath you, so that the next object you see all round next to the edges of the flat top are the Summits of Mountains of some distance off. As you move about on all sides you see more or less of the near neighbour country according as the Mountain you stand upon is in different parts steep or rounded--but the most new thing of all is the sudden leap of the eye from the extremity of what appears a plain into so vast a distance. On one part of the top there is a handsome pile of Stones done pointedly by some soldiers of artillery; I clim[b]ed on to them and so got a little higher than old Ben himself. It was not so cold as I expected--yet cold enough for a glass of Whisky now and then. There is not a more fickle thing than the top of a Mountain--what would a Lady give to change her head-dress as often and with as little trouble!--There are a good many red deer upon Ben Nevis--we did not see one--the dog we had with us kept a very sharp look out and really languished for a bit of a worry. I have said nothing yet of our getting on among the loose stones large and small sometimes on two, sometimes on three, sometimes four legs--sometimes two and stick, sometimes three and stick, then four again, then two, then a jump, so that we kept on ringing changes on foot, <b>hand,</b> <b>stick,</b> jump, boggle, stumble, foot, hand, foot (very gingerly), stick again, and then again a game at all fours. After all there was one Mrs. Cameron of 50 years of age and the fattest woman in all Inverness-shire who got up this Mountain some few years ago--true she had her servants--but then she had her self. She ought to have hired Sisyphus,--"Up the high hill he heaves a huge round--Mrs. Cameron." [...] 'Tis said a little conversation took place between the mountain and the Lady. After taking a glass of Whisky as she was tolerably seated at ease she thus began-- ...|$|E

40|$|Blindness is a {{state of}} lacking the visual {{perception}} due to physiological or neurological factors. The partial blindness represents the lack of integration in the growth of the optic nerve or visual centre of the eye, and total blindness is the full absence of the visual light perception. In this work, a simple, cheap, friendly user, smart blind guidance system is designed and implemented to improve the mobility of both blind and visually impaired people in a specific area. The proposed work includes a wearable equipment consists of head hat and mini <b>hand</b> <b>stick</b> to help the blind person to navigate alone safely and to avoid any obstacles that may be encountered, whether fixed or mobile, to prevent any possible accident. The main component of this system is the infrared sensor which is used to scan a predetermined area around blind by emitting-reflecting waves. The reflected signals received from the barrier objects are used as inputs to PIC microcontroller. The microcontroller is then used to determine the direction and distance of the objects around the blind. It also controls the peripheral components that alert the user about obstacle's shape, material, and direction. The implemented system is cheap, fast, and easy to use and an innovative affordable solution to blind and visually impaired people in third world countries...|$|E
40|$|The presupposition of the {{discourse}} of the theme is that South Africans experience a moral crisis no matter what one’s ethnic background, social-economic level, education, gender, profession, living conditions or whatever is. Chapter One deals with the matter of ethics {{in terms of its}} origin, necessity and purpose. It takes the issue further as it describes the moral situation nationally and abroad. As for other countries, South Africa needs to deal with materialism, individualism, consumerism, criminality, violence and the abuse of power. The spirit of the day in terms of the post-modern ideology implies both positive and negative influences in the well being of the society. Chapter Two describes the complexity of diversity as such. It takes note of the occurrence of this phenomenon as it is experienced through all the ages all over the world, but in particular in our country. We have to respect our historical background even if it is so clear that there were many incidents and processes of misfortune. A major issue is the political system of apartheid and the process of changing it into a new democratic dispensation. Religious diversity is another reality which has an impact on {{the lives of the people}} especially in terms of morality. Along with religious diversity, cultural diversity also occurs. It is an extensive practical, emotional and spiritual experience. Chapter Three focuses on culture and religion. These two human phenomena bring about experiences such as identity and morality. The development of new religious and cultural systems is taken into account in describing a new order in terms thereof. Along with traditional and diverse social perspectives, the post-religious way of thinking place new emphasis on being moral. Chapter Four tries to make something of the dynamics of religious and cultural diversity. It is important to understand the underlying energy of conflict, accommodation and unity of different entities. Difficulties like race, racism, exclusivism, inclusiveness, respect, tolerance and contemporary lifestyles are discussed. The dynamics of religious diversity also comes to a point. Chapter Five is set aside for empirical research. It was done on the qualitative basis. Interviews either in person, telephonically or by means of a questionnaire were conducted with the following persons: Prof. Louise du Toit, Br. Peter Just, Prof. Willem Landman, Rev. Cedric Mayson, Prof. Piet Strauss, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Prof. Marinus Wiechers. Their contributions were compiled for further use. Chapter Six explores the possibility of a new moral consciousness which should contribute to a better moral understanding of our social environment as well as the development of new and acceptable moral fabric. It incorporates the issue of leadership, opinion formers, individuals, world ethics and the importance of individual and shared responsibility. Closer to the point, Chapter Seven takes the phenomenon of religious and cultural diversity to the influence that it has on certain social levels and orders. Morality is a very practical thing which is present in all forms of human existence and function. Chapter Eight concludes with the discussion of the Christian church’s influence on the morality in South Africa. The church should on the one <b>hand</b> <b>stick</b> to its theological roots and prophetic calling, but on the other hand adapt to the new world in which it has a very important role to play. In its God-given task the church should live up to its destiny by being futuristic, creative, innovative and opportunistic. The ongoing process of secularisation of the world within which the church dwells, should be taken as a serious challenge for consistent and enduring moral healing.
