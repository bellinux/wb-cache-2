Such analyzers are essential for quantifying the amount of CH 4 and CO 2 released from various ecosystems (wetlands, rice paddies, forests, etc.) and other surface contexts (e. g. landfills, animal husbandry lots, etc.), and for understanding {{the dynamics of the}} atmospheric CH 4 and CO 2 budget and their impact on climate change and global warming. The purpose of this project is to develop a closed-path methane, carbon dioxide gas and water vapor analyzer capable of long-term measurements in remote areas for global climate change and environmental research. The analyzer will be capable of being deployed over a wide range of ecosystems to understand methane and carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. Measurements of methane and carbon dioxide exchange need to be made all year-round with limited maintenance requirements. During this Phase II effort, we successfully completed the design of the electronics, optical bench, trace gas detection method and mechanical infrastructure. We are using the technologies of two vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, a multiple-pass Herriott optical cell, wavelength modulation spectroscopy and direct absorption to measure methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. We also have designed the instrument application software, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), along with partial completion of the embedded software. The optical bench has been tested in a lab setting with very good results. Major sources of optical noise have been identified and through design, the optical noise floor is approaching - 60 dB.

40|$|The Passo della Morte block-slide {{covers a}} {{relative}} large {{area in the}} Carnic Alps, along {{the left side of}} the Taglia- mento River, between Forni di Sotto and Ampezzo (N-E of Italy). The high seismicity and the presence of the landslide increase the risk associated to the interest area. Moreover the large volume of material involved in the landslide (a few million of cubic meters), the presence of important infrastructure such as the road and two tunnels which cross the landslide, as well as the presence of the Tagliamento River that flow at the foot of the landslide, make the area very vulnerable. This study concerns with the western part of the Deep Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation (DSGSD). It fo- cuses on the potential instability of a rock slope (crossed by road tunnels) and its connection with the DSGSD activity. The main objectives of this study are: monitoring the rock mass movement, studying the seismic site ef- fect and defining the stratigraphic and geological characteristics of involved materials. Two vibration sensors have been installed inside the potential landslide: a short-period seismometer and a piezo- <b>electric</b> <b>transducer.</b> The microseismic activity recorded by the sensors has been analyzed, with particular regard to periods characterized by rapid changes in recorded seismic signals, and then correlated with the precipitation trend to evaluate the existence of a possible correlation between these phenomena. The microseismic activity study has highlighted the existence of a close link between microseisms and acoustic emissions recorded respectively by the seismometer and by the piezoelectric transducer. In addition, the comparison with the rainfall pattern has shown a direct relationship between different rainfall events and the sharp increase of microseismic activity detected by the two instruments. The correlation is good, even if acoustic emissions appear to be more sensitive than microseisms to short duration and low intensity rainfall events. The seismic site effects and the directivity in seismic site response of the rock mass have been investigated through the use of Nakamura (1989) method. In particular have been estimated the resonance frequencies and the polariza- tion directions of seismic energy in three selected sites. All sites have shown a clear evidence of polarization in the direction of N/NW-S/SE and E/NE-W/SW, compatible with the maximum slope inclination and with the limestone stratification direction outcropping in this area. In order to define the stratigraphic and geological characteristics of the materials involved, have been performed a GPR investigation and an active seismic survey.

Currently, piezo <b>electric</b> <b>transducers</b> are the typical detectors of choice, albeit possessing a limited bandwidth due to their resonant nature and a sensitivity that decreases proportionally to their size. Optical fibres provide immunity from electromagnetic interference and POF in particular boasts more suitable physical characteristics than silica optical fibre. The most important of these are lower acoustic impedance, a reduced Young's Modulus and a higher acoustic sensitivity than single-mode silica fibre at both 1 MHz and 10 MHz. POF therefore offers an interesting alternative to existing technology. Intrinsic fibre structures such as Bragg gratings and Fabry-Perot cavities may be inscribed into the fibre core using UV lasers. These gratings are a modulation of the refractive index of the fibre core and provide the advantages of high reflectivity, customisable bandwidth and point detection.

It {{has been reported that}} about 75 % of aerospace structures fail due to fatigue cyclic loading. The civil-structural components are subjected to some form of axial and transverse loading which continuously deteriorates the health of the structure. Mechanical components are also subjected to stresses due to contact pressures between several components. Thus for ACM structures, effective monitoring through-out the entire life is required as these often involve public life and huge investments. Owing to such necessity, researchers around the world are continuously working on the development of smart sensor based effective monitoring techniques. Piezo <b>electric</b> (PZT) <b>transducer</b> based electromechanical impedance (EMI) is one such technique which was developed for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this technique, PZT transducers are usually attached to the structure to be monitored and are then subjected to unit sinusoidal electric voltage to generate the electromechanical (EM) admittance signatures when interrogated to the desired frequency range of excitations. These signatures consist of real (conductance) and imaginary (susceptance) parts which serve as indicator to predict the structural health. Any deviations in these signatures during the monitoring period indicate disturbance in the structure. However, the EMI technique was not widely explored for structural load monitoring (such as fatigue cyclic load, monotonous load, axial and transverse load) compared to damage detection. In this paper, systematic experiments were presented on the specimens for axial load variations, transverse load variations, monotonous and fatigue load variation with discussions on boundary effect and buckling effects.

The control units are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with control units towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the control units at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the control units and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the control units more strongly at the matrix. When the control units are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the control units are given an intermediate hardening. The control units are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The control units are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The control units can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The control units can also be light waveguides. The <b>transducers</b> are piezo <b>electric,</b> magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The control units are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the control unit application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The control units are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems. ADVANTAGE - The control units are wholly embedded in the matrix, for the production of prepreg modules...|$|R
40|$|Only charge {{degree of}} freedom is {{utilized}} in most electronic devices. The use of the spin {{degree of freedom}} is relatively recent. The discovery of the Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) effect initiated the development of magnetoelectronics - the field that studies effects on electron transport involving the spin degree of freedom. GMR {{is a very large}} change in electrical resistance observed in ferromagnet/nonmagnet multilayer structures when the relative orientations of the magnetizations in ferromagnetic layers change as a function of applied field. The development of magnetoelectronics was very rapid leading to useful applications already within several years. For example, the GMR effect is presently routinely used to sense magnetic fields of data in read heads of magnetic hard disk drives. Whereas in GMR the relative direction of the magnetizations defines the current flowing through the system, an opposite effect of current on the magnetizations is also possible. Slonczewski predicted this effect - the spin transfer torque. In a ferromagnet/normal metal/ferromagnet structure with one magnetization free and the other fixed, the magnetization dynamics of the free layer can be driven by a current through the system as a result of spin-transfer torques. The magnetization dynamics in small magnetic clusters and films is a basic problem of condensed matter physics and is also important for applications: the spin-transfer effect may find applications in the so-called magnetic random access memories in which the direction of the magnetization is used to store the data and the rewriting process can be done by spin-transfer torques. Magnetoelectronics is a rapidly developing field at the moment and this thesis deals with some aspects of it related to magnetization dynamics and torques. The main subject of the thesis is torque, i. e. a change of angular momentum in time. We deal with torques that arise in spin valves and small magnetic cantilevers; spin-transfer torques in the former and magnetomechanical torques in the latter case. In order to describe spin-transfer torques we develop an approach based on the diffusion equation with quantum mechanical boundary conditions. With some simplifications this leads to magnetoelectronic circuit theory. This allows us to treat arbitrary diffuse spin valves and other devices. Magnetomechanical torques arise in small magnetic cantilevers. An example is a cantilever with one end fixed and the other covered with a magnetic film. It is important that the magnetic film has strong crystal or shape magnetic anisotropy, which provides coupling between vibrations and the magnetization dynamics. The anisotropy in the film leads to magnetomechanical torques that affect both the magnetization dynamics and the mechanical motion of the cantilever. This can open new possibilities for Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy in imaging and sensor applications. In Chapter 1 of this thesis we introduce the basic concepts of magnetoelectronics such as the spin-polarized current, the GMR effect, the spin-transfer torque and the magnetization dynamics. We introduce also magnetomechanical torques and analyze an example of a nanomechanical system {{that can be used for}} detecting magnetomechanical torques. We introduce magnetoelectronic circuit theory that can be used to describe spin-transfer torques. Furthermore, we give a short account of the derivation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In generalized form this equation allows us to describe the magnetization dynamics as a result of magnetic fields and/or spin-transfer torques. Finally, applications of the magnetomechanical torques in Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy is mentioned, and a design for a novel "spin-transfer motor" is proposed. In Chapter 2, we apply the diffusion equation to electronic transport in disordered ferromagnet (F) - normal metal (N) spin valves and show its equivalence to the magnetoelectronic circuit theory. The spin-transfer torque appears naturally in the diffusion approach from the boundary conditions at N-F interfaces; spin currents polarized perpendicular to the magnetization are absorbed at the interface of the ferromagnet. We obtain analytical expressions for the spin transfer torque and the angular magnetoresistance in asymmetric F 1 -N-F 2 spin valves. The effect of spin-flip processes in the normal metal and ferromagnet constituents are obtained analytically as well. In an N 1 -F 1 -N 2 -F 2 -N 3 system, spin-flip in the center metal N 2 reduces the spin-transfer, whereas spin-flip in the outer normal metals N 1 and N 3 can increase it by effectively enhancing the spin polarization of the device. In Chapter 3, magnetoelectronic circuit theory is employed to analyze perpendicular spin valves with ultra-thin ferromagnetic layers. We consider two finite size effects in transport through magnetic multilayers. The first effect arises when the magnetic layer thickness in spin valves becomes of the order or smaller than the spin-flip diffusion length. In this case the spin valve can become effectively asymmetric, which affects the transport properties and spin-transfer torques. The second effect arises in magnetic layers with thickness approaching the magnetic coherence length. In this case spin currents polarized perpendicular to the magnetization can pass through the thin ferromagnetic layer (the coherence length in transition metals is of the order of several atomic layers; much smaller than the spin-diffusion length and mean-free path). We investigate both effects on the angular magnetoresistance (aMR) and spin transfer torque. The spin-flip diffusion length in the ferromagnet as well as the interface spin-mixing conductance are determined by a fit to recent aMR experiments. At the end, we propose a three terminal device to measure the ferromagnetic coherence length. In Chapter 4, we study a small magnetic cantilever (e. g. a Si cantilever covered by a magnetic film or an entirely ferromagnetic cantilever). Such cantilevers can serve for observation of magnetomechanical torques, which, for example, leads to hybrid magnetovibrational ({}``polaritonic{}'') modes and line splittings in ferromagnetic resonance spectra. Magnetomechanical torques can even cause a complete magnetization reversal. It is still very difficult to make nanoelectromechanical systems working at microwave frequencies, but many new possibilities arise. We propose to build nanoelectromechanical systems propelled by spin-transfer and magnetomechanical torques. Such systems can extend the limits of detecting and exciting motion at the nanoscale and can serve as <b>electric</b> <b>transducers</b> of nanomechanical motion. Applied Science...|$|R
