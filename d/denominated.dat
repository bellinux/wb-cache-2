5|$|The UBS's Basel III {{capital ratio}} {{concerned}} {{benefited from the}} appreciation of the Swiss franc. At the same time, since the portion of UBS's operating income <b>denominated</b> in foreign currencies {{is greater than the}} portion of operating expenses so <b>denominated,</b> the UBS was also adversely affected, with further implications emanating from changes in interest rates as applied to equity and capital.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shooting}} thaler {{was issued}} for the Chur shooting festival in 1842 and is <b>denominated</b> at four francs. The second, issued for Glarus, has a face value of forty batzen. The third, minted for the shooting festival in Geneva, is <b>denominated</b> at ten francs. A total of eighteen designs were {{struck in the}} nineteenth century, concluding with the Bern issue of 1885. All those struck from 1855 to 1885 bear the denomination of five francs. Many nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and white metal, in small quantities. In 1934, a new series began production. This series, however, was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II. Another series of shooting thalers began mintage in 1984. The first coins issued in this new series were those minted for the festival at Oberhasli. Every year since has seen the mintage of two coins, each bearing the same design, one struck in silver, the other in gold. The only exceptions are the issues of Zürich and Sion in 1999, {{one of which was}} struck in copper–nickel, two in silver and two in gold. Until 1995, silver issues were <b>denominated</b> at fifty francs, while gold pieces were <b>denominated</b> at 1,000 francs. Later, gold issues were <b>denominated</b> at 500 francs, excepting only the Zürich issues of 1999.|$|E

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds <b>denominated</b> in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when <b>denominated</b> in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds <b>denominated</b> in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds <b>denominated</b> in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been <b>denominated</b> in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans <b>denominated</b> in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK <b>denominated</b> assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK <b>denominated</b> assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

The payment was partly financed by Venezuela, who bought Argentine bonds for US$1.6 billion. As of mid-2008 Venezuela hold an estimated US$6 billion in Argentine debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar <b>denominated</b> bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks and Moody's boosted Argentina's debt rating to B from B-.|$|E

The IFC's new international borrowings amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in liquidity management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E
5|$|The various Germanic {{states in}} the west all had coinages that imitated {{existing}} Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted {{until the end of}} the 7th century, when it was replaced by silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins <b>denominated</b> in multiple units were minted.|$|E
5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low {{values up to}} 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra values were made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was <b>denominated</b> initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E
40|$|Option {{written on}} several foreign {{exchange}} rates (FXRs) depends on {{correlation between the}} rates. To evaluate the option, historical estimates for correlations can be used but usually they are not stable. More significantly, pricing of the option using these estimates is usually inconsistent to the traded vanilla contracts. To price options written on several FXRs with the same <b>denominating</b> currency, financial practitioners and traders often use implied correlations calculated from implied volatilities of FXRs that form "currency triangles". However, some options may have underlying FXRs with different <b>denominating</b> currencies. In this paper, we present the formula for the implied correlations between such FXRs. These {{can be used for}} valuation, for example, barrier option on two FXRs with different <b>denominating</b> currencies where one FXR determines how much the option is in or out of the money at maturity while another FXR is related to the barrier. Other relevant options are straightforward. ...|$|R

5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% <b>denominated</b> in foreign currencies, debt payment {{is going to be more}} costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables <b>denominated</b> in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes <b>denominated</b> from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E

5000|$|A {{concrete}} number {{is a number}} associated with the things being counted, in contrast to an abstract number which is a number as a single entity. For example, [...] "five apples" [...] and [...] "half of a pie" [...] are {{concrete number}}s, while [...] "five" [...] and [...] "one half" [...] are abstract numbers. In mathematics the term [...] "number" [...] is usually taken to mean an abstract number. A <b>denominate</b> number {{is a type of}} concrete number with a unit of measure attached with it. For example, 5 inches is a <b>denominate</b> number because it has the unit inches after it.|$|R
