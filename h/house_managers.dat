500|$|Increasingly ill, Stevens took little {{part in the}} {{impeachment}} trial, at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler. Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and terrapin, port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the <b>House</b> <b>managers</b> on April 27. [...] As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally he allowed Butler to read {{the second half of}} his speech for him. Stevens focused on ArticleXI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The President, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, [...] "and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the meaning of professionalism in the {{occupation}} of housing management. It will explore the meaning of being a professional <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> in a profession which has some of the traits of being a 'semi-profession' (Etzioni, 1969). It asks how <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> view professionalism and what is its relevance, if any, to their working lives. It is primarily concerned with four key aspects of professionalism: identity, knowledge, boundaries and accountability. Analysis of these four aspects of professionalism are informed by social constructionism, ethnomethodology and ethnography. The sociology of the professions is used as a substantive literature to illuminate fieldwork data and provide new directions for the evolution of theory relating to housing management. Qualitative methods of data collection and analysis have been used to provide detail and depth in presenting a picture of the issues under investigation. Data was primarily collected from forty-nine interviews, supported by data collected from three separate periods of participant observation. The thesis argues that professionalism in housing management is an individualised project of the self rather than a collective project. Professionalism is expressed as an individualised response to, and a mediation of, competing managerial demands. <b>Housing</b> <b>managers</b> work upon themselves {{to meet the demands of}} their customers and their employers. The 'professional project of the self is influenced by their backgrounds, specifically their own beliefs and values regarding what it is to be a professional <b>housing</b> <b>manager.</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>managers</b> engage in negotiating the boundaries of knowledge and emotions in order to deliver a professional service. Accountability is expressed as a component part of professionalism, i. e. the ability to give an account of their actions, as well a response to formal performance measures. The thesis identifies two categories of <b>housing</b> <b>managers,</b> 'pragmatists' and 'pro-activists', who are distinguished from each other in their construction of professionalism. This study suggests that the concept of professionalism continues to exert a considerable influence on the thoughts and behaviours of these <b>housing</b> <b>managers.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
