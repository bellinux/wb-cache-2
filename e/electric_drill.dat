FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine {{collector}} Hardy Rodenstock. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr. and Michael Broadbent {{who at the time}} was a director at the London auction house Christie's and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of Château d'Yquem, including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare [...] "Jefferson bottles", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the American president, Thomas Jefferson. American businessman Bill Koch bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.|$|E
2500|$|Authorities {{were unable}} to {{determine}} the cause of the explosion, but concluded that it probably occurred while explosives were being mixed. The charred remains of an <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> with a paint-stirring attachment were found, and it was suggested that a spark from the drill's motor reached the mixture. Other possible theories include the scraping of boots on the floor causing ignition of highly explosive fumes, a cigarette being lit, and sparking from an electrical wire. TEMA later identified the dead as Faye Trentham (38), daughter Tanya Trentham (19), Doris Burns Longmire (38), David Nelce Webb (21, brother of Dan Lee Webb), Sybil Duggan, William Lee Burns, Beatrice Webb (51, mother of Dan Lee Webb), Dixie Freeman, David Parks and his wife Judy, and Albert Kenneth Johnson (52). Authorities found a cache of about 30 to 40 boxes of unexploded fireworks and six 55-gallon steel drums full of chemical explosives in a nearby trailer. Federal firearms agents also found husks eight to ten inches in length and three to four inches in diameter which prompted Polk County sheriffs to speculate that [...] "more than just fireworks" [...] were involved. They were buried in the ground on the farm and later detonated in an open pit in nearby Copperhill having been used as evidence in Webb's trial. A total of 172 cases of fireworks were found. The farm was also found to be guarded with an elaborate security system which consisted of surveillance cameras, electric fences, alarms, guard dogs, and warning signs. Polk County Sheriff Frank Payne told reporters that he thought that they were gearing up for the Fourth of July, and that the explosives could be used by terrorists.|$|E

It is an electric, thermosensitive equipment, not indicated for surgical use, which has not been previously evaluated regarding the sterilization efficacy, being suspect of infection risk. This study evaluated the efficacy of sterilization by ethylene oxide (EtO) of new drills that were intentionally contaminated with Bacillus atrophaeus spores.

40|$|Coiled tubing in {{combination}} with a downhole <b>electric</b> <b>drilling</b> motor has many advantages. The rotation speed of the drill bit can be precisely controlled. The electric conductors trans-mit downhole data with high speed and allow logging while drilling. One task within the PDT-COIL project was the integration of electric conductors into {{the wall of a}} spoolable fatigue resistant thermoplastic composite tube for <b>electric</b> <b>drilling</b> appli-cations. Up to now no fatigue resistant electric conductor solution has been available to withstand the excessive axial elongation and compression induced by spooling operations. Based on theoretical models and experimental verifications, a new type of highly elastic elec-trical conductor has been developed. A prototype has been industrially produced having 2 kV rated voltage and 20 A continuous current. This cable with a cross section of < 30 mm 2 is able to transfer over 40 kW of electric power and withstands high axial deformations. The main concept is based on synchronous radial contraction of all conductor elements when subjected to axial elongation and bending. Comparative experiments on conventional solid conductors revealed a very high degree of radial flexibility and high tensile capability of the new concept. Survival with up to 40 % elastic tensile strain has been achieved compared to 0. 1 % of conventional annealed copper. The hyperelastic conductor may function as component for energy transmission and also for powering sensors as well as actuators in intelligent composite material systems. Due to its unique axial elasticity, the complete structure can be exposed to high mechanical stress without damaging the embedded electric system...|$|R
