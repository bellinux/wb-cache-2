5000|$|The 3.6 L (...) LY7 {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in the 2004 Cadillac CTS sedan. It has a 10.2:1 compression ratio, a bore of 94.0 mm and a stroke of 85.6 mm. Lower powered versions only have variable cam phasing on the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> (LEO). Selected models also include variable exhaust. The engine weighs 370 lb as installed.|$|E
50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the <b>inlet</b> <b>cams</b> and also the coolant pump. The exhaust cams are driven by short link belts driven from {{the ends of the}} <b>inlet</b> <b>cams</b> {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any tensioning device. Belt tension is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front belt drive is tensioned by a spring-loaded tensioner pulley incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|R

5000|$|The Zetec {{had another}} {{redesign}} in 1998. This version, the Zetec-R, had a two-piece crankcase which helped damp out noise and vibration, conventional tappets with shims rather than hydraulic ones, and longer connecting rods {{with a lower}} piston compression height. This engine was used in turbocharged form in the Focus RS and had [...] (dubbed Duratec RS). It was also used in the Focus ST170 with a cylinder head modified by Cosworth with Variable Valve Timing on the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> and had [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of head that were bolted to the common four-cylinder block were {{designated}} K8 (8 valves) and K16 (16 valves). A later head design also incorporated a Rover-designed Variable Valve Control (VVC) unit (derived from an expired AP patent). This allowed more power to be developed without compromising low-speed torque and flexibility. The VVC system constantly alters the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> period, resulting in a remarkably flexible drive: the torque curve of a VVC K-series engine is virtually flat throughout the rev range and power climbs steadily with no fall-off whatsoever until the rev limiter kicks in at 7,200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Subaru's 2003-2009 EZ series EZ30 engine {{featured}} a Porsche designed and German manufactured Variable Valve Lift (VVL) system, that further enhances high range power and smoothness at idle. It was discontinued on the successor of the EZ30 engine, the EZ36 engine. Instead, it has dual AVCS, VVT on both <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>cams.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{the model}} year 2009, Alfa Romeo {{introduced}} a new turbocharged Gasoline (Petrol) engine badged as [...] "TBi", this 1742 cc unit has direct injection and variable valve timing in both <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>cams.</b> This new engine has [...] and 320 Nm of torque. Eventually this unit will replace GM derived 2.2 and 1.9 JTS units. Also a new [...] JTDm diesel became available.|$|R
50|$|The XJR, {{introduced}} in 1988, was a high-performance model that was finished by the Oxfordshire-based JaguarSport company, a dual venture by Jaguar and race team TWR, at TWRs Kidlington-based factory alongside the XJ220. Based upon a Sovereign model, it was fitted with uprated suspension with unique Bilstein dampers, a revised power steering valve {{to increase the}} steering weight by 40% and special exterior paint and exterior styling touches. Early examples were fitted with a 3.6 L AJ6 engine in standard tune but later models had a TWR tuned version of the 4.0 AJ6, with new <b>inlet</b> manifolds, uprated <b>cams</b> and a tweaked ECU. Some examples are also fitted with a larger bore JaguarSport exhaust system.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this system is that it {{incorporates}} [...] "floating" [...] <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> drive pulleys that are not directly keyed to the shafts. This means that special setting tools are required to establish the cam timing before the pulley fixings are tightened. This requirement {{is the result of}} the complexity of the cam drive train. In addition to the length and thickness tolerance of the belts, the accuracy of the cam timing is also affected by the positional and diameter tolerance of each pulley and the thickness of each major engine casting. The result is that the required degree of timing accuracy could not otherwise be maintained.|$|E
50|$|The 2.0-litre 16-valve Twin Spark {{engine of}} the 2.0 TS model {{was based on the}} Fiat SuperFIRE-family block, {{featuring}} an Alfa Romeo-developed cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder. Variable <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> timing, which allowed for 25 degrees of variation, was designed to improve torque and give a more linear power delivery. In addition, this engine has two belt driven balance shafts rotating at twice the engine speed, to eliminate engine vibrations. The base 1.8-litre engine did not feature balance shafts. The TS was the best-selling version of the GTV and Spider. CF2 and CF3 engines have plastic valve cover and variable-length intake manifold.|$|E
5000|$|The Cortina Crossflow {{block was}} also {{the basis for the}} FVA, an F2 engine {{introduced}} in 1966, and developed under the same contract as the DFV, for the new 1.6-litre engine rules. This engine featured 16 valves operated by twin overhead camshafts driven by a train of 9 gears. The metering unit for the Lucas mechanical fuel injection was rotated by a toothed belt from the gear-driven <b>inlet</b> <b>cam,</b> while the exhaust cam directly drove an alternator on the rear of the head. It produced [...] at 9000 rpm. This engine dominated the category until 1971, and was also used in sports car racing in 1.8 Litre form as the FVC.|$|E
5000|$|The JTS direct {{injection}} system {{was first used}} in a V6 engine in 2005 {{with the introduction of}} the Alfa 159 and Brera. This is not related to the Alfa Romeo V6 engine, but is instead a derivation of the GM High Feature engine; built in Australia by GM Holden. While it retains the High Feature engine's 89 mm bore, 85.6 mm stroke and chain driven camshafts, it is modified by Alfa for their performance, fuel economy and sound characteristics. These modifications include: [...] "TwinPhaser" [...] variable valve timing (cam-phasing on both <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>cams,</b> thus the name), gasoline {{direct injection}} and a higher compression ratio of 11.25:1. It also operates with a lean burn system up to about 1500 rpm, as on many other engines from the company and is capable of generating , a number matching the larger LY7 3.6 L variant used by GM. Alfa Romeo stopped using the V6 JTS engine in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon Murray then {{approached}} BMW, {{which took}} an interest, and the motorsport division BMW M headed by engine expert Paul Rosche {{designed and built}} Murray a 6.1 L (6,064 cc) 60-degree V12 engine called the BMW S70/2.At [...] and 266 kg the BMW engine ended up 14% more powerful and 16 kg heavier than Gordon Murray's original specifications, with the same block length.It has an aluminium alloy block and heads, with 86 mm x 87 mm bore/stroke, quad overhead camshafts with variable valve timing (a relatively new and unproven technology for the time) for maximum flexibility {{of control over the}} four valves per cylinder, and a chain drive for the camshafts for maximum reliability.The engine uses a dry sump oil lubrication system.The carbon fibre body panels and monocoque required significant heat insulation in the engine compartment, so Murray's solution was to line the engine bay with a highly efficient heat-reflector: gold foil. Approximately 16 g (0.8 ounce) of gold was used in each car.The road version used a compression ratio of 11:1 to produce [...] at 7400 rpm and torque output of 480 lb·ft (651 N·m) at 5600 rpm. The engine has a redline rev limiter set at 7500 rpm.In contrast to raw engine power, a car's power-to-weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle's powerplant. The standard F1 achieves 550 hp/ton (403 kW/tonne), or just 3.6 lb/hp.The cam carriers, covers, oil sump, dry sump, and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings. The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda-Sondion controls.The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance, using a system very closely based on BMW's VANOS variable timing system for the BMW M3; it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> relative to the exhaust cam at low revs, which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low-speed torque. At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to 42 degrees (compare 25 degrees on the M3) for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance.To allow the fuel to atomise fully, the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve - operating at low engine rpm - while the second is located higher up the inlet tract - operating at higher rpm. The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the engine computer.Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil. The closed-loop fuel injection is sequential. The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem. The pistons are forged in aluminium.Every cylinder bore has a nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance.From 1998 to 2000, the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR sports car used a similar S70/2 engine.The engine was given a short development time, causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience. The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods. Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication.As for fuel consumption, the engine achieves on average 15.2 mpg (15 L/100 km), at worst 9.3 mpg (25 L/100 km) and at best 23.4 mpg (10 L/100 km).|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and vibrations of camshaft excited by multi-follower elements are modeled and analyzed. A pushrod valve train system from a four-cylinder diesel engine is {{selected as the}} case study. The camshaft is modeled to analyze the interactions of multi-follower elements. Both the camshaft angular vibration and bending vibration are taken into consideration. Each follower element is simplified as a multi-mass system. The lumped masses are connected by the spring elements and the damping elements. The contact force model at the cam–tappet interfaces was developed based on the elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication theory of finite line conjunction. From the analysis results, {{it can be seen}} that the bending vibration of camshaft is mainly in the normal direction at the cam–tappet interfaces. Moreover, the bending vibration is mainly influenced by the overlapping of <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> function and exhaust cam function of each cylinder. The angular vibration of camshaft mainly focuses at the fundamental frequency and the harmonic frequency corresponding to the cylinder number...|$|E
40|$|Increasing thermal {{efficiency}} in diesel engines through low heat rejection concept is a feasible technique. In LHR engines the high heat evolution {{is achieved by}} insulating the combustion chamber surfaces and coolant side of the cylinder with partially stabilized zirconia of 0. 5 mm thickness and the effective utilization of this heat depend on the engine design and operating conditions. To make the LHR engines more suitable for automobile and stationary applications, the extended expansion was introduced by modifying the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> for late closing of intake valve through Miller’s cycle for extended expansion. Through the extended expansion concept the actual work done increases, exhaust blow-down loss reduced and the {{thermal efficiency}} of the LHR engine is improved. In LHR engines, the formation of nitric oxide is more, to reduce the nitric oxide emission, the internal EGR is incorporated using modified exhaust cam with secondary lobe. Modifications of gas exchange with internal EGR resulted in decrease in nitric oxide emissions. In this work, the parametric {{studies were carried out}} both theoretically and experimentally. The combustion, performance and emission parameters were studied and were found to be satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{fundamental}} aim of extended expansion concept {{is to achieve}} higher work done which in turn leads to higher thermal efficiency. This concept {{is compatible with the}} application of turbocharger and LHR engine. The Low Heat Rejection engine was developed by coating the piston crown, cylinder head inside with valves and cylinder liner with partially stabilized zirconia coating of 0. 5 mm thickness. Extended expansion in diesel engines is termed as Miller cycle in which the expansion ratio is increased by reducing the compression ratio by modifying the <b>inlet</b> <b>cam</b> for late inlet valve closing. The specific fuel consumption reduces to an appreciable level and the thermal efficiency of the extended expansion turbocharged LHR engine is improved. In this work, a thermodynamic model was formulated and developed to simulate the LHR based extended expansion turbocharged direct injection diesel engine. It includes a gas flow model, a heat transfer model, and a two zone combustion model. Gas exchange model is modified by incorporating the Miller cycle, by delaying inlet valve closing timing which had resulted in considerable improvement in thermal efficiency of turbocharged LHR engines. The heat transfer model, calculates the convective and radiative heat transfer between the gas and wall by taking into account of the combustion chamber surface temperature swings. Using the two-zone combustion model, the combustion parameters and the chemical equilibrium compositions were determined. The chemical equilibrium compositions were used to calculate the Nitric oxide formation rate by assuming a modified Zeldovich mechanism. The accuracy of this model is scrutinized against actual test results from the engine. The factors which affect thermal efficiency and exhaust emissions were deduced and their influences were discussed. In the final analysis it is seen that there is an excellent agreement in all of these evaluations. Keywords—Low Heat Rejection, Miller cycle. I...|$|E
