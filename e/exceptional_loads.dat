The traffic management in the underground, e. g. railway tunnels, roads and subways, or providing other services, e. g. pipes for water supply or hydropower and sanitation, represents a growing need for civilized countries. The paper presents some new design aspects aimed at the construction of prefabricated lining segments for urban tunnels in soft ground, able to ensure adequate structural performance under <b>exceptional</b> <b>loads,</b> such as fire and explosion within the structure. The design problems and the advantages resulting from the adoption of high performance fiber reinforced materials, like High Performance Fibers Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) and Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) and Textiles (TRC) are described, pointing out the critical issue {{in the design of}} a new prototype characterized by a layered structure. A dynamic meso-scale characterization carried out by using a shock-tube suitably designed and a full scale test reproducing an internal explosion in a concrete pipe embedded in a soft soil, aimed at checking some crucial assumptions used in the segment design are briefly described.

40|$|In view {{of recent}} {{disasters}} and their immense economical and human consequences {{more and more}} focus is given {{not only on the}} safety of structures - to reduce the risk for the life of people by collapse even under <b>exceptional</b> <b>loading</b> – but on minimizing the disastrous results and to enable a quick rebuilding and reuse. One crucial mean to achieve this aim is the design of redundant robust structures. Robustness prevents the collapse of the total structure when only parts of the structure are damaged or destroyed. To avoid progressive failure, redundant structures with inherent sufficient ductile behaviour allowing deformations when a local failure occurs, have to be built. Redundancy can be achieved by allowing force redistribution within a structural system. Therefore the single sections and joints have to be especially designed and optimized, not necessarily requiring additional fabrication costs. But until now no specific rules for robustness by ductile joints exist. The aim of the present project is to define general requirements for ductile joints as part of a structural system subjected to <b>exceptional</b> unforeseen <b>loading...</b>|$|R

As a prototype of masonry towers a cantilever beam is analyzed assuming that the first modal shape governs the structural motion.

40|$|Glazing facades {{are widely}} used in {{building}} structures, due {{to a series of}} aesthetic, thermal, lightening aspects. From a structural point of view, under the action of <b>exceptional</b> <b>loads</b> as impacts, explosions or seismic events, the glazing envelopes often represent the critical component for multi-storey buildings, due to the typically brittle behavior and limited tensile resistance of the glass panes, hence requiring specific design concepts. In this paper, the feasibility and potential of special mechanical connectors interposed at the interface between a given multi-storey primary building structure and the glazing facade are extensively investigated via accurate Finite-Element models, under the action of a set of seven natural seismic records. As shown, the proposed vibration control devices can markedly improve the dynamic performance of the traditional structure, both in terms of global (i. e. building seismic response) and local performances (i. e. at the component level). The final result, once the input parameters of the vibration control devices are properly designed, is an assembled structural system in which the glazing façade works as passive control system for the primary structure...|$|E

Strong speedups, extreme wind veer and high turbulence create a harsh environment for turbine safety and durability.

For this reason, two wind farms, having very different features, are selected: the former is sited on a very gentle terrain and its dynamics is mainly driven by wake interactions, while the latter is instead sited on a very complex terrain. The wind field induced by the orography is calculated with two different numerical approaches, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and mass consistent modelling. Numerical results are compared and validated against experimental measurements from anemometer met-masts and from turbines SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) data sets.

Among the wide range of existing reinforced concrete structures, motorway viaducts stand out for their strategic relevance.

The field of bionanotechnology draws inspiration from nature by utilizing biomolecular building blocks such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, for the (self-) assembly of new structures for applications in biomedicine, optics, or electronics. Among the toolbox of available building blocks, proteins that form cage-like structures, such as viruses and virus-like particles, {{have been of}} particular interest since they form highly symmetrical assemblies and can be readily modified genetically or chemically both on the outer or inner surface.
