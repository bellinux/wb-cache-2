500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various {{reasons for his}} disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then {{chairman}} of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin {{to try to persuade}} wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become [...] "burnt out" [...] and said, [...] "In the end I felt <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ghost" [...] is a four-minute, eighteen-second song {{described}} by Vibe as an [...] "electro retro funk" [...] track with harmonies influenced from disco. [...] "Ghost" [...] is {{about wanting to}} [...] "disappear completely and start over" [...] again, as it was inspired by Dubuc relocating from Dallas to Los Angeles without letting anyone know. The concept of the song is sung in the hook [...] "This time <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> disappear." [...] He described it as [...] "really special song. The moment I wrote it, I thought, 'Wow, this could really be something." [...] Written and produced by Dubuc, the original mix that appears on Mystery Skulls' debut album Forever was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at 4db Studios in London, with Adam Looker assisting. Colin Leonard mastered the track at SING Mastering in Atlanta using SING Technology.|$|E
500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

60|$|I did {{not dare}} follow him there beneath the moonlight, since it best suited my plans not to {{interrupt}} his--I wished him to reach his destination unsuspecting, that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> learn <b>just</b> where that destination lay and the business that awaited the night prowler there.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{does seem}} to have put his back up," [...] he agreed. [...] "As to going on, <b>I</b> think we <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well move tomorrow. My arm's all right." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 2008 in the Academy Scientific and Technical Award {{ceremony}} at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, Fedkiw was awarded an 80th Academy Award for Technical Achievement {{for the development of}} the Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fluid simulation system. [...] He shared the award with Nick Rasmussen and Frank Losasso Petterson. [...] Fedkiw does physics-based simulation that enable better water effects. [...] Previous representations had varying levels of success. [...] They often did well at surface representation, but were less efficient at smaller particles such as breaking waves. [...] Fedkiw's team's innovative “particle level set method” allows both smooth surfaces and water breakdown renderings including water spray. [...] Fedkiw has worked with Industrial Light and Magic, Pixar Animation Studios, Intel Corporation, Honda and Sony Pictures Imageworks. [...] Fedkiw commented that when he was informed that he would be presented his award by Jessica Alba he was quoted by the Associated Press as follows: [...] "They said I got 60 seconds so <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> spend the last 15 realizing I'm 10 feet away from the most beautiful woman on the planet [...] [...] [...] and no restraining order this time.". On February 7, 2015, he received a second Academy Scientific and Technical Award {{for the development of the}} ILM PhysBAM Destruction System.|$|E
2500|$|The Kriegsmarine {{wanted a}} front {{as short as}} possible, as it {{regarded}} this as more defensible. Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from Dover to Eastbourne and stressed that shipping between Cherbourg/Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Royal Navy based in Portsmouth and Plymouth. General Halder rejected this: [...] "From the army's point of view I regard it as complete suicide, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine".|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called the}} film [...] "warm and funny" [...] and thought [...] "there {{is a lot}} to like about it," [...] but {{ultimately}} was disappointed with it on the whole. He observed, [...] "Try as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't accept this Victorian story in modern dress. The motivations seemed wrong (would 20th century people behave this way?), the plotting seemed contrived (as indeed it was), and the plot's habit of springing big surprises on us was too manipulative. This is not at all a bad movie, mind you, but a good movie gone wrong, through a simple twist of miscalculation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you like. I {{believe that}} as a rule a ring has to be {{purchased}} {{at the conclusion of}} an arrangement such as we have just entered into, and <b>I</b> thought you <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well chose one yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Through all her tirade {{they had}} stood close together, her face visibly eager {{in the glow}} from the hotel; and Milt had grown taller.

60|$|FALDER. When I found I'd done a {{thing like}} that, {{to do it for}} nothing seemed so dreadful. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have chucked myself into the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{but there}} are so many of us, and all have a hankering after terra firma. <b>Might</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> say, that I have your permission, to ask Captain Stowel, to let me have a run on the cliffs?" ...|$|R
60|$|A waning {{misshapen}} moon {{hung over}} the garden when I awoke, my mind still, clear, empty. So empty that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> but <b>just</b> have re-entered the world after the lapse of ages. In this silvery hush of night, winged shapes were wheeling around and above me, piercing the air with mad, strident cries. With sight strangely sharpened and powerful, I gazed tranquilly up, and supposed for a while these birds were swallows. Idly I watched them, scarcely conscious whether they were real or creatures of the imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... "O fie, Monkbarns!--to {{hear the}} like o' that frae you!--But yell {{walk up and}} see the poor young lad?--Hegh sirs? sae young and weel-favoured--and day by day he has eat less and less, and now he hardly touches onything, only just pits {{a bit on the}} plate to make fashion--and his poor cheek has turned every day thinner and paler, sae that he now really looks as auld as me, that might be his mother--no that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be <b>just</b> that neither, but {{something}} very near it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> try,' pursued he, disconsolately, 'whether she {{did think}} me any steadier. I hope {{she did not}} think me very troublesome. I tried not to harass her much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know I've got no head, but I thought, if I {{washed and}} put on a clane shirt and smock-frock, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> call," [...] said Leaf, turning away {{disappointed}} and trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon this intrusion, Miss Moss. I {{really did}} not know you were in this {{neighbourhood}} till a few minutes ago," [...] said Barret, sitting down on the heather beside her. [...] "I accidentally observed you, and I have been so very fortunate in finding rare plants this morning, that <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> venture, <b>just</b> for a few minutes, to interrupt the privacy of your picnic. See, here!" [...] he added, taking off the botanical box and opening it; [...] "just look at all this!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Here it is, Hugh," [...] cried my guardian, gaily; [...] "and {{a capital}} letter it is! I wish I {{could read the}} whole of it to you; but the two girls made me promise never to show their letters to any one, which could mean only you, before they would promise to write {{anything}} to me beyond commonplaces. Now, I get their sentiments freely and naturally, and the correspondence {{is a source of}} much pleasure to me. I think, however, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> venture <b>just</b> to give you one extract." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What I've {{got to say}} to ye, Mrs. Wade,--as I reckon you be,--is {{strictly}} {{private and}} confidential! Why, ye'll see afore I get through. But I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well caution ye agin our being disturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me!" [...] {{said the}} captain, purpling. [...] "I don’t talk about her. You don’t hear {{me talk about}} her. I’m not always talking about anybody. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> have {{mentioned}} her name when talking about Truefitt’s troubles; that’s all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' Said her father, after {{a fit of}} musing, 'there is {{something}} natural in what the young man says; and if my mind had been turned that way, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have felt <b>just</b> the same.

6000|$|JOY. When {{he comes}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{as well go}} to bed. [Passionately.] And now he's chosen to-day to come down here, when I haven't seen her for two months! Why couldn't he come when Mother and I'd gone home. It's simply brutal! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> say, in an off-hand way, that Jones was a rascal, or a liar, or a fool, or {{anything}} of that sort. But I would never caution her against Jones. By George, I believe a woman can stand anything better than that." ...|$|E

Judge Carro has appeared in numerous documentaries about the Kennedy assassination.
