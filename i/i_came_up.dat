5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up.</b> I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about the}} track [...] "Here's Why Tears Dry" [...] Clarke said, [...] "The tune came about when {{a family member}} was ending a long-time love affair. There {{were a lot of}} tears, so <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with that song. The tears {{evaporate}} into thin air, and the pain eventually goes away." [...] "I Wanna Play for You Too" [...] was written by Felton Pilate who plays keyboards on the track.|$|E

500|$|Actor Chris Rock {{recommended}} producer Rubin to Timberlake, {{who considered}} {{the idea and}} discussed it with Rubin when he saw him at a music festival in Coachella, California. Timberlake went to singer-songwriter Neil Diamond's studio, where Rubin played him some demos, {{one of which was}} a ballad that would become [...] "(Another Song) All Over Again". Timberlake suggested that the collaboration was meant to [...] "do the anti-whatever-you-want-to-call-it that [...] <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with".|$|E
500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Really Got Me" [...] {{was written}} by Ray Davies, the Kinks' vocalist and main songwriter, {{sometime}} between 9 and 12 March 1964. Created on the piano {{in the front room}} of the Davies' home, the song was stylistically very different from the finished product, being much lighter and somewhat jazz-oriented. Ray said of the song's writing, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with [...] I hadn't been writing songs very long at all. It {{was one of the first}} five I ever came up with." ...|$|E

500|$|Talese {{has come}} to reject the label of [...] "New Journalism" [...] for this reason. [...] He told NPR: [...] "The term new journalism became very fashionable on college campuses in the 1970s {{and some of its}} {{practitioners}} tended to be a little loose with the facts. [...] And that's where I wanted to part company. [...] <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the New York Times as a copy boy and later on became a reporter and I so revered the traditions of the Times in being accurate." ...|$|E

[...] Van Peebles stated that [...] "story-wise, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with an idea, why not the direct approach. [...] To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario." ...|$|E
500|$|Alston played {{minor league}} {{baseball}} as an infielder for the Greenwood Chiefs and Huntington Red Birds in 1935 and 1936, respectively. For the 1936 Huntington team, he hit 35 home runs in 120 games. Alston's only major league game was with the St. Louis Cardinals on September 27, 1936, substituting for Johnny Mize at first base. He later described his major league playing career to a reporter by saying, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> to bat for the Cards back in '36, and Lon Warneke struck me out. That's it". He also committed one error in two fielding chances at first base.|$|E

[...] The delay also caused the remaining issues to be pushed back with issue #8 being released in December 2016.|$|E
500|$|When {{the game}} was {{localized}} for distribution in America, Capcom changed {{the title of the}} game from Rockman to Mega Man. This moniker was created by Capcom's then-Senior Vice President Joseph Marici, who claimed it was changed merely because he did not like the original name. [...] "That title was horrible," [...] Marici said. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with Mega Man, and they liked it enough to keep using it for the U.S. games." [...] 1UP.com's Nadia Oxford attributed this change to Capcom's belief that American children would be more interested in a game with the latter title.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Flotilla {{came from a}} {{combination}} of [...] "sci-fi like Star Wars and submarine movies". Chung explained that he [...] "figured there was enough games about little fighter jets", and that what he had in mind was [...] "a jumbo battleship floating in space". Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because [...] "any fantastical creature design <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people." [...] Therefore, instead of trying {{to solve the problem of}} creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: [...] " [...] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures." [...] In an interview with SquareGo, Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game's development process.|$|E
500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

It was a high order to say, 'I found a way to make you smile.' I had to come up with, 'OK, what are those ways?' That was tough."

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with a way to tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Planet of the Titans was {{expected}} to be filmed in the United Kingdom in order to keep production costs low. In July 1976, Jerry Isenberg was assigned to be executive producer of the new film and British writers Bryant and Scott were hired in September. The duo had no science fiction writing experience, but had written the films Don't Look Now (1973) and Joseph Andrews (1977). Roddenberry defended the hiring of the pair, saying [...] "I'm very excited about some of the ideas they've come up with. The concept that only a science fiction writer can write science fiction motion pictures is ridiculous. Look at me. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with Star Trek, and I was a dramatic writer. I wrote for TV." [...] Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Their 20-page treatment was submitted the following month. It was entitled Planet of the Titans and was received favourably by Diller and fellow executive Michael Eisner. The writers were told by Paramount to proceed to script on October 6.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she {{had nothing to do with}} a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show." [...] Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season.|$|E
