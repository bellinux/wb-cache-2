50|$|The black-throated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata) {{is a small}} American sparrow {{primarily}} {{found in}} the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow,</b> due to its preferred habitat of arid desert hillsides and scrub. This name usually refers to the <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow</b> of Africa and Asia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer simplex) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, {{found in}} the Sahara Desert, Central Asia, and Iran.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow</b> is {{not afraid}} to come near humans and {{sometimes}} builds nests in muddy walls. The Mozabite Berbers build their homes with holes in the walls to welcome these birds, which they call [...] "bar-rode", and if one sings all day in the house, they say this is a sign of good news. The Tuareg, who call the bird [...] "moula-moula", also say that this bird brings good news when it comes to stay near the camp.|$|E
50|$|In {{the coastal}} belt, bird species {{recorded}} are American flamingo on the beaches, and also many birds of prey. Migratory birds pass through Libya, and are seen mostly along the coastline. The most notable ones are the flamingo, Kentish plover in the Bengazi Reserve. Houbara bustard and the European white stork {{are reported in}} the Kouf National Park and in the beaches and lagoons. In the oases, <b>desert</b> larks, <b>desert</b> <b>sparrows,</b> and spotted sandgrouse have been reported. Other notable species reported are Aquila chrysaetos, Alectoris barbara, Pterocles spp. and Chlamydotis undulata with herons, ducks, waders, Ciconia nigra, Ciconia ciconia, and Milvus milvus (red kite) from the brackish lagoons.|$|R
5000|$|Melospiza melodia fallax (Baird, 1854), <b>desert</b> song <b>sparrow.</b> Sonoran {{and parts}} of Mojave Deserts to E Arizona. A pale ruddy desert form. Synonyms are M. m. saltonis Grinnell, 1909, M. m. virginis Marshall and Behle, 1942 and M. m. bendirei Phillips, 1943.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include red-crested pochards, pygmy cormorants, saker falcons, common coots, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, white-winged woodpeckers, brown-necked ravens, great tits, desert larks, streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian <b>desert</b> warblers, saxaul <b>sparrows</b> and <b>desert</b> finches.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} {{occur in}} some of driest parts of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, and a distinct subspecies occurs in areas of Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The Asian subspecies may be a separate species, and is called the Asian <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow</b> or Zarudny's sparrow (Passer simplex zarudnyi). According to Guy Kirwan and colleagues, the Asian birds are separate under any definitions of species except the biological species concept. BirdLife International, and therefore the IUCN Red List, recognise both species.|$|E
50|$|Nikolai Alekseyvich Zarudny (Николай Алексеевич Зарудный; 13 September 1859 - 17 March 1919) was a Ukrainian-Russian {{explorer}} and zoologist of Ukrainian origin, {{who studied}} the fauna, especially the birds of Central Asia. He was born in Gryakovo, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire). He wrote his first ornithology book in 1896 and made five expeditions in the Caspian region in 1884-1892. He led other expeditions to Persia supported by the Russian Geographic Society and the St. Petersburg Zoological Institute. He collected nearly 3,140 specimens of birds and 50,000 insects. After the Russian Revolution, his collection was nationalized by the Bolsheviks {{and moved to the}} museum at the University of Tashkent. For his work the Russian Geographical Society awarded him the Przhevalsky Medal. While at Tashkent, his last work on the ornithology of Turkestan region was not completed as he died of accidental poisoning. He published 218 monographs {{in the course of his}} life and named many species. Among the species and other taxa named after Zarudny are Zarudny's jird, Zarudny's rock shrew, Diplometopon zarudnyi, Schizothorax zarudnyi, and the distinctive Asian subspecies of the <b>desert</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer simplex zarudnyi).|$|E
50|$|A 1150 km2 {{tract of}} land {{encompassing}} the reservoir and its surrounds {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include mallards, pygmy cormorants, saker falcons, cinereous vultures, great bustards, houbara bustards, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, European rollers, white-winged woodpeckers, great tits, desert larks, streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian <b>desert</b> warblers, saxaul <b>sparrows</b> and <b>desert</b> finches.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the harsh}} conditions, these deserts and the {{surrounding}} regions sustain many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, marbled polecats, wild Bactrian camels, Mongolian wild ass and sandplovers. They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves. Drought-adapted shrubs in the <b>desert</b> included gray <b>sparrow's</b> saltwort (Salsola passerina), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.|$|R
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised, differing in {{the overall}} tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female. The subspecies ammodendri occurs in {{the west of the}} saxaul sparrow's range, while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east. This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China. A bird of <b>deserts,</b> the saxaul <b>sparrow</b> favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities.|$|R
40|$|The {{house or}} English sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a brown, chunky bird about 5 3 / 4 inches (15 cm) long, and {{very common in}} human-made habitats. The house sparrow was first {{introduced}} in Brooklyn, New York, from England in 1850 and has spread throughout the continent. The house sparrow is found in nearly every habitat except dense forest, alpine, and <b>desert</b> environments. House <b>sparrows</b> are primarily granivorous. Breeding can occur in any month but is most common from March through August. House sparrows consume grains in fields and in storage. The house sparrow is afforded no legal protection by federal statutes {{because it is an}} introduced species...|$|R
40|$|Intercellular lipids of the {{stratum corneum}} (SC), the outer {{layer of the}} epidermis, form a barrier to water vapor {{diffusion}} through the skin. Previously, we measured cutaneous water loss (CWL) and lipid composition of the SC of adult house sparrows from two populations, one living in the deserts of Saudi Arabia and another living in mesic Ohio. Adult <b>desert</b> house <b>sparrows</b> had a lower CWL, a lower proportion of free fatty acids, and {{a higher proportion of}} ceramides and cerebrosides in the SC compared with mesic sparrows. In this study, we investigated developmental plasticity of CWL and lipid composition of the SC in desert and mesic nestling house sparrows reared in low and high humidity and compared our results with previous work on adults. We measured CWL of nestlings and analyzed the lipid composition of the SC using thin-layer chromatography. We showed that nestling house sparrows from both localities had higher CWL than adults in their natural environment, a result of major modifications of the lipid composition of the SC. The expression of plasticity in CWL seems to be a response to opposed selection pressures, thermoregulation and water conservation, at different life stages, on which regulation of CWL plays a crucial role. Desert nestlings showed a greater degree of plasticity in CWL and lipid composition of the SC than did mesic nestlings, a finding consistent with the idea that organisms exposed to more environmental stress ought to be more plastic than individuals living in more benign environments...|$|R
