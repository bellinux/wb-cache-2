5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing {{twice a day}} (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5000|$|The reform <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the archaisms, neologisms and vulgarisms {{supposedly}} {{introduced by}} the [...] "national-democrats".|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> competition on western routes. The operation was dissolved in 1966.|$|R
5|$|Bushnell {{felt the}} best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original's release: Pong Doubles, Super Pong, Ultra Pong, Quadrapong, and Pin-Pong. The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new {{gameplay}} elements; for example, Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs, while Quadrapong—also released by Kee Games as Elimination—has them compete against each other in a four way field. Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy's doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to Puppy Pong and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. In 1976, Atari released Breakout, a single-player variation of Pong where the object of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball. Like Pong, Breakout was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay, such as Arkanoid, Alleyway, and Break 'Em All.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the ways}} that Thumb code {{provides}} a more dense encoding <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the four bit selector from non-branch instructions.|$|E
25|$|A {{move that}} {{surrounds}} an opponent's stone from both sides. The {{purpose of the}} attack <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the opponent's ability to form a base or occupy a territory on the side.|$|E

25|$|If a {{horse is}} {{severely}} dyspnoeic (that is, struggling to breathe), {{the most important}} measure to take <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> it from the stable or barn into fresh air. This can be a life-saving measure in an acute attack.|$|E
25|$|Screening (see also screen filter) – The {{first step}} in purifying surface water <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> large debris such as sticks, leaves, rubbish and other large {{particles}} which may interfere with subsequent purification steps. Most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{use of this}} {{technique}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the SAM molecules in a process called shaving, where the atomic force microscope tip is dragged along the surface mechanically removing the molecules. An atomic force microscope can also remove SAM molecules by local oxidation nanolithography.|$|E
50|$|The options {{depending}} on what you roll <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> a tile, rotate a tile, or add new tiles to the board.|$|R
5000|$|In many religions, it <b>is</b> common <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> shoes when {{entering}} a place considered holy. For example, in the Book of Exodus, Moses <b>was</b> instructed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> his shoes before approaching the burning bush: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A contemptible dreamer," [...] I said. [...] "Pity him, Sire. He has his uses. <b>To</b> <b>remove</b> {{him would}} <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> a channel {{through which we}} can always obtain {{knowledge}} precisely of what is doing." ...|$|R
25|$|Thus, one {{incentive}} for banks to create securitized assets <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> risky assets from their balance sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk, {{so that they}} (the banks) receive cash in return. This allows banks to invest more of their capital in new loans or other assets and possibly have a lower capital requirement.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the gas {{processing}} plant <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> water vapor from the gas using either the regenerable absorption in liquid triethylene glycol (TEG), commonly referred to as glycol dehydration, deliquescent chloride desiccants, and or a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit which is regenerable adsorption using a solid adsorbent. Other newer processes like membranes may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strategy}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> dendritic {{cells from}} the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated {{in the presence of}} tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor cell lysate (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.|$|E
50|$|To {{demolish}} bridges, hoe rams <b>are</b> {{typically used}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the concrete road deck and piers, while hydraulic shears <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the bridge's structural steel.|$|R
50|$|On August 27, 2014, activists struck Ukrainian TV channel ICTV. The {{demand of}} the protesters <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> Russian TV series off the air.|$|R
50|$|Most prunes are {{freestone}} cultivars (the pit <b>is</b> easy <b>to</b> <b>remove),</b> {{whereas most}} other plums grown for fresh consumption are clingstone (the pit <b>is</b> more difficult <b>to</b> <b>remove).</b>|$|R
25|$|Stained glass shards {{used for}} mosaic glass are also tumbled. No {{abrasive}} is used, to avoid clouding the glass; {{there is only}} water as a lubricant. The object of this tumbling <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the sharp edges from the glass, so {{that it may be}} handled safely. As little as 8 hours of tumbling may be sufficient for tumbled glass.|$|E
25|$|Some {{implementations}} (e.g. Kad) do {{not have}} replication nor caching. The purpose of this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> old information quickly from the system. The node that is providing the file will periodically refresh the information onto the network (perform FIND_NODE and STORE messages). When all of the nodes having the file go offline, nobody will be refreshing its values (sources and keywords) and the information will eventually disappear from the network.|$|E
25|$|Surgery as a {{treatment}} is frequently used in most types of head and neck cancer. Usually the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the cancerous cells entirely. This can be particularly tricky if the cancer is near the larynx and can result in the person being unable to speak. Surgery is also commonly used to resect (remove) {{some or all of}} the cervical lymph nodes to prevent further spread of the disease.|$|E
50|$|The purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{damaging}} and disfiguring repair on the thangka and its lining. By doing this, re-stitching of vulnerable areas {{could be}} done.|$|R

50|$|The use of high-gradient {{magnetic}} separation techniques should <b>be</b> developed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{dust from the}} spacesuits following exploration as the fine fraction of the lunar dust is magnetic. Furthermore, vacuums can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> dust from spacesuits.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum {{and then to the}} ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} hand-washing in the health-care setting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{pathogenic}} microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them. The New England Journal of Medicine {{reports that a}} lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients. One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{requirement of}} the reactor for the Fischer–Tropsch process <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{the heat of the}} reaction. This type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat; the remainder of which is removed by the products and recycled in the system. The formation of heavy waxes should be avoided, since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomerations. This leads to fluidization. Hence, risers are operated over 570nbsp&K.|$|E
5000|$|The party {{began to}} schism into {{so-called}} [...] "revolver oppositions", whose target <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{the gap between}} the leaders and the supporters by open violence.|$|R
