40|$|A {{state space}} method is {{proposed}} for analyzing surface instability of <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> with <b>elastic</b> properties varying in the thickness direction. By assuming linear elasticity with nonlinear kinematics, the governing equations for the incremental stress field from a fun-damental state are derived for arbitrarily graded <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> subject to plane-strain compression, {{which lead to}} an eigenvalue problem. By discretizing the elastic properties into piecewise constant functions with homogeneous sublayers, a state space method is developed to solve the eigenvalue problem and predict the critical condition for onset of surface instability. Results are presented for homogeneous layers, bilayers, and continu-ously graded <b>elastic</b> <b>layers.</b> The state space solutions for elastic bilayers are {{in close agreement with}} the analytical solution for thin film wrinkling within the limit of linear elasticity. Numerical solutions for continuously graded <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> are compared to finite element results in a previous study (Lee et al., 2008, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 56, pp. 858 – 868).

40|$|Compression of <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> between {{parallel}} plates often finds {{applications in}} the mechanical characterization of soft materials or the transfer-printing of nanomembranes with rubber stamps. In addition, annular rubbery gaskets and sealers are often under uniaxial compression during service. Analysis of <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> under compression {{has been focused on}} incompressible materials, and empirical assumptions of displacements were adopted for simplicity. For compressible materials, solutions obtained by the method of averaged equilibrium are sufficient for effective compression modulus but inaccurate for the displacement or stress fields, whereas solutions obtained by the method of series expansion are considerably complicated. In this article, we report full field, closed-form solutions for bonded <b>elastic</b> <b>layers</b> (disks, annuli, annuli with rigid shafts, infinitely long strips) in compression using separation of variables without any preassumed deformation profile. Our solutions can satisfy the exact forms of the equilibrium equations and all the essential boundary conditions as well as the weak form of the natural boundary conditions. Therefore, the predicted stress, displacement, and effective modulus have found excellent agreement with finite element modeling (FEM) results over a wide range of Poisson’s ratio and aspect ratio. Our analytical and FEM solutions of the stress, displacement, and effective modulus are highly sensitive to Poisson’s ratio, especially near 0. 5. Therefore, we also propose a viable means to simultaneously measure the intrinsic Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of elastically compressible layers without camera settings. When Poisson’s ratio approaches 0. 5, our solutions can degenerate to classical solutions for incompressible <b>elastic</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In elastodynamics, Love waves, {{named after}} Augustus Edward Hough Love, are {{horizontally}} polarized surface waves.

In seismology, Love waves (also known as Q waves (Quer: German for lateral)) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake. Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911. They form a distinct class, different from other types of seismic waves, such as P-waves and S-waves (both body waves), or Rayleigh waves (another type of surface wave). Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P- or S- waves, but faster than Rayleigh waves. These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer/ sub-layers.|$|E

The different performances of trenches on a saturated poroelastic half-space and a single-phase elastic half-space to the moving load-induced ground vibration are identified. It is found that the discrepancy of the screening efficiencies between the two models becomes significant when the load speed approaches the Rayleigh wave speed of the ground surface.
