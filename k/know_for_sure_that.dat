500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But there is one thing we <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>That</b> when a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{support of}} Jeyaretnam, Opposition MP Chiam See Tong {{claimed that the}} PAP {{government}} had introduced GRCs to reduce the likelihood that by-elections would be necessary. He said: [...] "The people <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Government is already firmly in place and it cannot be toppled by a by-election. For this reason, Singaporeans are more amenable to vote the Opposition at a by-election and the PAP knows that." [...] Noting that the PAP had dispatched Heng Chee How, an unsuccessful candidate in the 1997 general election, to assist with some of Choo's duties, Chiam argued that appointing a failed candidate to replace a resigned MP {{would not be the}} choice of the voters but that of the ruling party. [...] "The essence of democracy is representation and choice.... The voters at Jalan Besar GRC must be given their democratic right to choose their own representative in Parliament, [...] not [...] to force one upon them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{former prime}} {{minister}} Sir John Major suggested in November 2013 that Scotland would need to re-apply for EU membership, but that this would mean overcoming opposition to separatists among many existing member states, particularly Spain. It may block Scottish membership of the EU, amid fears of repercussions with separatist movements in Catalonia and the Basque Country: in November 2013 the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, said: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> a region that would separate from a member state of the European Union would remain outside the European Union {{and that should be}} known by the Scots {{and the rest of the}} European citizens." [...] He also stated that an independent Scotland would become a [...] "third country" [...] outside the EU and would require the consent of all 28 EU states to rejoin the EU, but that he would not seek to block an independent Scotland's entry. Salmond cited a letter from Mario Tenreiro of the EC's secretariat general that said it would be legally possible to renegotiate the situation of the UK and Scotland within the EU by unanimous agreement of all member states. Spain's position was reiterated two days before the referendum by the Spanish European affairs minister, who said [...] "It is crystal clear that any partner member-state that leaves the member state is out of the European Union. If they want to apply again, they would have to follow the procedure of article 49 of the treaties." ...|$|E
