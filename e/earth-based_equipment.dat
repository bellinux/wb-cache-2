40|$|The functions, {{operational}} procedures, {{and major}} items of equipment {{that comprise the}} terrestrial mining process are characterized. These data are used to synthesize a similar activity on the lunar surface. Functions, operations, and types of equipment that can be suitably transferred to lunar operation are identified. Shortfalls, enhancements, and technology development needs are described. The lunar mining process and what is required to adapt terrestrial equipment are highlighted. It is concluded that translation of terrestrial mining equipment and operational processes to perform similar functions on the lunar surface is practical. Adequate attention {{must be given to}} the harsh environment and logistical constraints of the lunar setting. By using <b>earth-based</b> <b>equipment</b> as a forcing function, near- and long-term benefits are derived (i. e., improved terrestrial mining in the near term vis-a-vis commercial production of helium- 3 in the long term...|$|E
