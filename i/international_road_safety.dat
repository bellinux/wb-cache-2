40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} current knowledge concerning {{incidence and}} prevention, data collection practices and any associated inadequacies, relating to suicide and natural deaths in road traffic. Method: The research involved (1) {{a review of}} literature from refereed journals, electronic resources and appropriate agency reports, (2) a search of <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> and vital statistics data available from the internet, published reports and other sources {{to determine the extent}} to which suicide and natural death crashes are included and (3), emailing questionnaires to vital statistics and road traffic organisations to collect information on current practices in the treatment of suicide and natural deaths in national data systems. Results: Relative to other methods of suicide and injury, literature on suicide and natural deaths in road traffic was scarce, particularly for pedestrian suicides. Available data and literature suggested that driver suicides and natural driver deaths are relatively minor components of road traffic fatalities but may be underestimated. Driver suicides are mostly male and aged 25 - 34 years. Risk factors are previous suicide attempts, a history of mental illness and the presence of alcohol. Most natural driver deaths are male, aged 50 to 70 years, caused by cardio-vascular disease and involve little or no property damage. Data on driver but not pedestrian suicide or natural deaths was located on some electronic national vital statistics sites. The data located on national and <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> electronic sites appeared to be unintentional and n...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{is split}} into three parts. In the first part, the EuroRAP (European Road Assessment Programme) {{methodology}} is presented. It represents a unified European approach of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> rating using two different procedures. The first is Risk Rating, based on traffic accidents and traffic data, {{the second is}} Star Rating, based on rating of road condition, equipment and roadside land use. All subsequent procedures and tools, including road inspection, safer roads investment plans, performance tracking and other are describrd. System of Star Rating encourages engineers to design safer roads, also known as forgiving roads and self-explaining <b>roads.</b> Also, iRAP (<b>international</b> <b>Road</b> Assessment Programme) is presented. It is an <b>international</b> organization for <b>roads</b> <b>safety</b> and forms an umbrella organization for EuroRAP, AusRAP, KiwiRAP and usRAP. In the second part, input data and attributes, which are necessary for appropriate Star Rating, is presented. In the third part, results of rating of pilot road section 0262 Rašica-Žlebič on state road G 2 - 106, are presented and commented. Results include proposed countermeasures and their cost-benefit analysis...|$|R
30|$|This {{indicates}} {{that we can}} only reach high <b>road</b> tunnel <b>safety</b> by reaching out to all citizens, to establish a national and even <b>international</b> culture of <b>road</b> <b>safety.</b> As is noted by Holm (2007), the Swedish society has a poor <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> culture. It is difficult for authorities to take decisions such as lowered speed or traffic barriers aiming at improving safety when the citizens living there work against them and mainly prioritize high availability and accessibility. Several campaigns have been performed to alter the public perception into a more safety oriented perspective, not least safety belt, keeping speed limits, and ‘drinking equals no driving’ campaigns. Cultural beliefs and habits are naturally transferred from older to younger generations, as it becomes part of how we do things, resulting in safer roads in the long run.|$|R

40|$|This {{handbook}} {{contains a}} large variety of {{road safety measures}} from throughout Europe. The goal of SUPREME was to collect, analyse, summarise and publish best practices in road safety in the Member States of the European Union, {{as well as in}} Switzerland and Norway. This document is a collection of best practices at national scale and aims to present the project’s results to national/regional policy and decision makers across Europe, thereby encouraging the adoption of successful road safety strategies and measures. As such, the intention of this project is to contribute to reaching the EU target of a 50 % reduction in road fatalities in 2010. The project was commissioned by DG TREN of the European Commission. It started in December 2005 and finished in June 2007. A total of 31 national and <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> organisations were involved.

40|$|The {{content of}} a vehicle {{consists}} mainly of mechanical and electronic components. However software becomes an increasingly important part of future vehicles. The software side of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) {{is part of the}} <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> strategy to improve the mobility, comfort and safety of road users. Road crashes cost Australia $ 15 billion a year and 95 % of these crashes are attributed to driver error. ITS and driver assistance systems could reduce driver error by augmenting the awareness of relevant safety-critical contextual information. Such a context-aware system is difficult to program due to the incompletness and complexity of the information from the environment. This paper outlines research issues {{that need to be addressed}} to deploy sustainable context-aware software for vehicles. A solution to improve the productivity of context-aware systems by using a new Context Oriented Programming (COP) paradigms is suggested. COP is then used to build a driver assistance system that takes into account driver’s cognitive workload...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the characteristics and availability of fatal road-crash databases worldwide. The study involved two parts. In the first part, the major international road databases were briefly reviewed. These databases included IRTAD, IRF, UNECE, WHO, and CARE. In the second part, the national databases in 20 selected countries were examined. The countries included the 14 European countries in CARE, plus Germany, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the U. S. The main results were as follows: (1) The available international databases of fatal road crashes typically include aggregated data. (2) There is a national database of fatal road crashes in each country examined. (3) All countries provide aggregated crash data, but there are substantial restrictions {{on the availability of}} disaggregated data. (4) Overall, the crash data at the accident level are relatively similar, but there are substantial differences in the information at the person level. The results of this study imply that <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> research would greatly benefit from expanded availability of disaggregated fatal crash data worldwide...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, over 1. 2 {{million people}} are killed in traffic every year and another 20 to 50 million are seriously injured. Road traffic {{injuries}} {{are estimated to be}} the eighth leading cause of death globally. If no action is taken, road traffic injuries will be the fifth leading cause of death in 2030. It was within this framework that the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) commissioned SWOV to perform a study to identify successful strategies to bring and keep road safety on the political agenda’s throughout the world, and to identify promising routes to further improvements. The present report focuses {{on the role of the}} <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> community, including the FIA. During the last decade a remarkable number of initiatives have been taken or have been intensified. However, there are no indications that the projected increase (if no action is taken) to 1. 9 million people killed in road crashes in 2020 has been reversed. The current report analyses and assesses several international developments and related documents aiming to improve road safety globally, UN Resolution 64 / 255 in particular. Based on this, the report presents some considerations and makes recommendations for further progress at the international level, and for further strengthening of the large number of relevant international organizations and international initiatives. Among other things, it has been concluded that road safety has to be put higher on the political agenda, both nationally and internationally, and needs to receive more funding to do justice to the size of the problem. The UN resolutions call for further strengthening of international cooperation and the concept of shared responsibility is crucial here. However, this concept has not yet been sufficiently elaborated. It is recommended that the UN, and more specifically the WHO in its coordinating role, together with all important players in the field develop a clear view of how the international community can contribute to improve global road safety, starting from a shared responsibility concept. Furthermore, a ten-point action plan is proposed, which involves: Bridging the implementation gap; Including road safety as a sustainable development goal; Improving road safety data quality; Monitoring progress and evaluating interventions; Gaining support to bridge the funding gap; Ensuring massive capacity building in low and middle income countries; Building a knowledge base in a ‘clearing house’; Carrying out national policy reviews; Strengthening awareness raising and advocacy efforts. The FIA is considered to be in a position to develop itself into a major player in the field of global road safety. The FIA is recommended to clarify, both for itself and for the <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> community, which role it wishes to play, to formulate its strategic goals for road safety and to indicate which contributions it is willing and able to make for the ten-point action plan to be effective...|$|E
40|$|Adopting {{a traffic}} safety culture approach, this paper {{identifies}} and discusses the ongoing challenge of promoting the road safety message in Australia. It is widely acknowledged that mass {{media and public}} education initiatives have {{played a critical role}} in the significant positive changes witnessed in community attitudes to road safety in the last three to four decades. It could be argued that mass media and education have had a direct influence on behaviours and attitudes, as well as an indirect influence through signposting and awareness raising functions in conjunction with enforcement. Great achievements have been made in reducing fatalities on Australia’s roads; a concept which is well understood among the <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> fraternity. How well these achievements are appreciated by the general Australian community however, is not clear. This paper explores the lessons that can be learnt from successes in attitudinal and behaviour change in regard to seatbelt use and drink driving in Australia. It also identifies and discusses key challenges associated with achieving further positive changes in community attitudes and behaviours, particularly in relation to behaviours that may not be perceived by the community as dangerous, such as speeding and mobile phone use while driving. Potential strategies for future mass media and public education campaigns to target these challenges are suggested, including ways of harnessing the power of contemporary traffic law enforcement techniques, such as point-to-point speed enforcement and in-vehicle technologies, to help spread the road safety message...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{comparative}} analysis of macroscopic trends in road safety {{has been a}} popular research topic. The objective {{of this research is}} to propose a simple and, at the same time, reliable multiple regime model framework for <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> comparisons, allowing for the identification of slope changes of personal risk curves and respective breakpoints. Method: The trends of road traffic fatalities in several EU countries have been examined through the temporal evolution of elementary socioeconomic indicators, namely motorized vehicle fleet and population, at the country level. Results: Piece-wise linear regression models have been fitted, using a methodology that allows the simultaneous estimation of all slopes and breakpoints. The number and location of breakpoints, as well as the slope of the connecting trends, vary among countries, thus indicating different road safety evolution patterns. Impact on industry: Macroscopic analysis of road accident trends may be proved beneficial for the identification of best examples and the implementation of appropriate programmes and measures, which will lead to important benefits for the society and the economy through the reduction of road fatalities and injuries. Best performing countries and the related programmes and measures adopted may concern several safety improvements at the processes of the road, the vehicle and the insurance industries. Conclusions: Lessons from the analysis of the past road safety patterns of developed countries provide some insight into the underlying process that relates motorization levels with personal risk and can prove to be beneficial for predicting the road safety evolution of developing countries that may have not yet reached the same breakpoints. Furthermore, the presented framework may serve as a basis to build more elaborate models, including more reliable exposure indicators (such as vehicle-km driven).
