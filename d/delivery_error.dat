We formulate the minimum overhead problem as a rate-distortion problem. We evaluate lower bounds on the minimum overhead incurred by maintaining link state information when link state routing protocols {{are designed with}} guaranteed delivery ratio for data packets. We also characterize the deficit caused by the routing overhead on the overall transport capacity of a mobile network. Further we derive a threshold value for the <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> ratio, and conclude that no link state routing protocol can achieve a <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> ratio smaller than this threshold.

Most of the research on amplification effects has focused on manufacturing (or inventory) supply chains. However, with the increasing importance of services in the past 10 years, the research of service supply chains has found a significant role. This research project explores the bullwhip effect in hospital internal service supply chains.

40|$|Purpose Develop a {{framework}} to characterize helical TomoTherapy (HT) machine <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> and their clinical significance. Method and materials Ten nasopharynx HT plans were edited to introduce errors in Jaw width (JW), couch speed (CS), gantry period (GP), gantry start position (GSP), multi leaf collimator leaf open times (MLC LOT). In case of MLC LOT only, both systematic and random <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> were investigated. Each error type was simulated independently {{for a range}} of magnitudes. Dose distributions for the clinical reference plans and the error simulated plans were compared to establish the magnitude for each error type which resulted in a change in clinical tolerance, defined as 5 % variation in D 95 of PTV 70, D 0. 1 cc of spinal cord, D 0. 1 cc of brainstem and the smallest value of either a 10 % or 3. 6 Gy dose variation in mean parotid dose. Results Dose variation from systematic <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> in JW ± 0. 5 mm, CS ranges between − 1 % to 1. 5 %, GP ± 1 s, GSP ranges between − 20 to 2. 50 and MLC LOT random error up to 2 % from the planned value relative to the clinical reference plan was within the set tolerance values for all the patient cohorts. GSP errors and the random MLC LOT errors with up to 10 % standard deviation were found to be relatively insensitive compared to other <b>delivery</b> <b>errors.</b> Conclusion This work has established {{a framework}} to characterize HT machine <b>delivery</b> <b>errors.</b> This framework could be applied to any patient dataset to determine clinically relevant HT QA tolerances...|$|R

The {{research}} of service supply chains has found {{a significant role in the}} past decade. The main research goal of this paper is to model and simulate the internal service supply chains of a healthcare system to study the effects of different parameters on the outputs and capability measures of the processes. The specific objectives are to analyse medication delivery errors in a community hospital based on the results of the models and to explore the presence of bullwhip effect in the internal service supply chains of the hospital. Design/methodology/approach: System dynamics which is an approach for understanding the behaviour of complex systems, used as a methodology to model two internal service supply chains of the hospital with a sub-model created to simulate medication delivery errors in the hospital. The models are validated using the actual data of the hospital and the results are analyzed based on experimental design techniques. Findings: It is observed that the bullwhip effect may not occur in a hospital’s internal service supply chains. Furthermore the paper points out the conditions for reducing the medication <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> in a hospital. Research limitations/implications: Because of the community hospital’s data availability the type of service supply chains modelled in this paper, are small service supply chains, representing only the tasks which are done inside the hospital.

40|$|AbstractSince the {{perfection}} of the blue light emitting diode twenty years ago, LED production by MOCVD has seen strong growth. The luminous efficacy of current LED lamps is now among the highest for all light sources. In order to obtain highest efficacy, brightness and color trueness, {{the control of the}} epitaxial process by which the LED epi film is produced is crucial. As for any chemical reaction, the product of the reaction depends on the composition of the educts, the reaction temperature and pressure. The better the control of process parameters the better controlled are the properties of the product. For liquid organometallic precursors, controlled evaporation is employed to generate a vapor. To ensure that the intended concentration is delivered to the reactor with the greatest precision, {{it is important to understand}} and control three critical parameters: the temperature of the liquid, total pressure and carrier gas flow. While carrier gas flow and total pressure can be controlled with high precision, the temperature of the liquid precursor shifts considerably with carrier gas flow, fill level, and geometric factors of the thermal bath and the cylinder. We analyzed the performance of a commonly used cylinder filled with trimethylgallium (TMGa) to quantify the typical performance of on-board sources. After turning on the carrier gas, the TMGa cools by more than 1 °C which results in a concentration decrease, i. e. TMGa <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> of more than 6 %. It takes about 90 min or circa 50 g of TMGa to reach steady state with a stable concentration. We will show how central delivery from an engineered evaporation device reduces the TMGa <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> to less than ± 0. 5 % allowing instant use of the vapor without waiting for a source to stabilize...|$|E

40|$|<b>Delivery</b> <b>errors</b> during {{radiotherapy}} {{may lead}} to medical harm and reduced life expectancy for patients. Such serious incidents can be avoided by performing dose verification online, i. e., while the patient is being irradiated, creating the possibility of halting the linac {{in case of a}} large overdosage or underdosage. The offline EPID-based 3 D in vivo dosimetry system clinically employed at our institute is in principle suited for online treatment verification, provided the system is able to complete 3 D dose reconstruction and verification within 420 ms, the present acquisition time of a single EPID frame. It is the aim of this study to show that our EPID-based dosimetry system can be made fast enough to achieve online 3 D in vivo dose verification. The current dose verification system was sped up in two ways. First, a new software package was developed to perform all computations that are not dependent on portal image acquisition separately, thus removing the need for doing these calculations in real time. Second, the 3 D dose reconstruction algorithm was sped up via a new, multithreaded implementation. Dose verification was implemented by comparing planned with reconstructed 3 D dose distributions delivered to two regions in a patient: the target volume and the nontarget volume receiving at least 10 cGy. In both volumes, the mean dose is compared, while in the nontarget volume, the near-maximum dose (D 2) is compared as well. The real-time dosimetry system was tested by irradiating an anthropomorphic phantom with three VMAT plans: a 6 MV head-and-neck treatment plan, a 10 MV rectum treatment plan, and a 10 MV prostate treatment plan. In all plans, two types of serious <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> were introduced. The functionality of automatically halting the linac was also implemented and tested. The precomputation time per treatment was ∼ 180 s/treatment arc, depending on gantry angle resolution. The complete processing of a single portal frame, including dose verification, took 266 ± 11 ms on a dual octocore Intel Xeon E 5 - 2630 CPU running at 2. 40 GHz.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to set up {{statistical}} quality control for monitoring of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> using machine log data. Eclipse and Clinac iX linac with the RapidArc system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) is used for delivery of the VMAT plan. During the delivery of the RapidArc fields, the machine determines the delivered motor units (MUs) and gantry angle position accuracy and the standard deviations of MU (sigma_MU; dosimetric error) and gantry angle (sigma_GA; geometric error) are displayed on the console monitor after completion of the RapidArc delivery. In the present study, first, the log data was analyzed to confirm its validity and usability; then, statistical process control (SPC) was applied to monitor the sigma_MU and sigma_GA in a timely manner for all RapidArc fields: a total of 195 arc fields for 99 patients. The sigma_MU and sigma_GA were determined twice for all fields, that is, first during the patient-specific plan QA and then again during the first treatment. The sigma_MU and sigma_GA time series were quite stable irrespective of the treatment site; however, the sigma_GA was strongly dependent on the gantry rotation speed. The sigma_GA of the RapidArc delivery for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was smaller than that for the typical VMAT. Therefore, SPC was applied for SBRT cases and general cases respectively. Moreover, the accuracy of the potential meter of gantry rotation is important, since the sigma_GA can be dramatically changed due to its condition. By applying SPC to the sigma_MU and sigma_GA, we could monitor the <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> efficiently. However, the upper and lower limits of SPC need to be determined carefully with full knowledge of the machine and log data. Comment: KJMP 2014 conference at Busan, Korea (South).

This aspect is particularly important in WSNs, as nodes have very limited computing resources. In order to study the impact of software components on WSN performance, a simulated WSN and a physical WSN were setup in the IEEE 802. 15. 4 domain. Tests revealed that the simulator must take into account the software components of the WSN to produce realistic results.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} of 2 D ion chamber array, film dosimetry and point dose measurement for detecting IMRT <b>delivery</b> <b>errors.</b> Method and Materials: 2 types of IMRT <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> were considered. First type involved adding 1 mm systematic error to 1 bank of the MLC leaves, resulting in a dose discrepancy of ≥ 5 %. The second type involved ‘undeliverable intensity patterns’, resulting from improper use of smoothness constraint during optimization. 4 and 2 plans were studied for type 1 and type 2 errors respectively. 2 D dose distribution was measured by 2 D array (MatriXX) and film (EDR 2). IBA CC 04 chamber was used for point dose measurement. Measurements were done for composite plans with plan-specific gantry angles (2 D array & film + point dose) and gantry fixed at 0 o (2 D array only). For type 2 error, we also measured dose profile of individual fields (2 D array & film). Error detection threshold was set at 90 % for 3 %/ 3 mm criteria of the γ analysis. Results: For 1 mm systematic error in MLC positions, when the plans were delivered with the planspecific gantry angles, both array and film were able to reject all the faulty plans. If the plans were delivered at 0 o, the 2 D array detected only 1 out of the 4 error plans. For the ‘undeliverable intensity patterns’, the 2 D array, film and absolute point dose measurement were able to reject both plans when composite plans were delivered at plan-specific beam angles. Irradiating composite plans with gantry fixed at 0 o failed to spot errors in them, although errors were found when analyzing individual fields. Conclusions: Our study showed limitation of 2 D array in detecting <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> when using the single gantry angle composite plan approach.

40|$|One way {{to reduce}} patient set-up errors in {{radiotherapy}} is to measure the position during the first N treatment fractions, and to do an unconditional correction of the set-up position once at the (N + 1) th fraction.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) A {{real-time}} EPID-based dosimetric and geometric verification {{system is}} proposed. The system enables detection of gross treatment delivery errors {{prior to delivery}} of substantial radiation to the patient in IMRT treatment. A sophisticated physics-based model is utilized to generate an image stream of predicted cine EPID images as a reference dataset, and it then compares these to measured EPID images acquired during treatment. A new method that combines both geometrical and dosimetric comparison is used for synchronisation. In addition, jaw position and collimator angle are detected and verified {{in the beginning of}} treatment (approximately first 5 seconds). The system was simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The synchronisation is shown to agree within 2 control points (~ 1 % of the total dose delivered). In real-time dosimetry, two case studies were simulated: 1) Gross dose <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> and 2) MLC leaf failure; the real-time dosimetry system was able to detect both of these errors in real-time (within 0. 1 sec). In real-time geometry, jaw positioning and collimator angle were tested, and an average 0. 5 mm error for jaw positioning and less than 0. 5 degrees for collimator angle are shown in the tests. MLC leaf verification uses the advantageous result of synchronisation to monitor the MLC leaf motion behaviour during the treatment. A real-time verification system can prevent many of the major mistreatments that have recently occurred in radiation therapy. The system design is fast and can be easily applied in a clinical environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectrical neural {{stimulation}} is the technique used to modulate neural activity by inducing an instantaneous charge imbalance. This is typically achieved by injecting a constant current and controlling the stimulation time. However, constant voltage stimulation {{is found to}} be more energy-efficient although it is challenging to control the amount of charge delivered. This paper presents a novel, fully integrated circuit for facilitating charge-metering in constant voltage stimulation. It utilises two complementary stimulation paths. Each path includes a small capacitor, a comparator and a counter. They form a mixed-signal integrator that integrates the stimulation current onto the capacitor while monitoring its voltage against a threshold using the comparator. The pulses from the comparator are used to increment the counter and reset the capacitor. Therefore, by knowing the value of the capacitor, threshold voltage and output of the counter, the quantity of charge delivered can be calculated. The system has been fabricated in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology, occupying a total active area of 339 μm× 110 μm. Experimental results were taken using: (1) a resistor–capacitor EEI model and (2) platinum electrodes with ringer solution. The viability of this method in recruiting action potentials has been demonstrated using a cuff electrode with Xenopus sciatic nerve. For a 10 nC target charge delivery, the results of (2) show a charge <b>delivery</b> <b>error</b> of 3. 4 % and a typical residual charge of 77. 19 pC without passive charge recycling.

The model-based protocol is repeatedly tested on a 40 patient virtual cohort over 1. 4 M patient hours. The analysis is repeated for SMBG frequency of 2 - 10 /day. Long term HbA 1 c is estimated from clinically reported formulas to assess performance. Results: The protocol controlled 100 % of the cohort to ADA recommended HbA 1 c with SMBG frequency of 6 /day. Peak control is achieved at SMBG frequency of 8 /day. A {{small but significant}} decrease in time in the 72 - 144 mg/dL band and consequent increase in mild and severe hypoglycaemia occurs at SMBG frequency of 10 /day. Time spent in the 72 - 108 mg/dL band is not significantly different to a no error and no variability simulation. Cohort HbA 1 c is reduced for all SMBG frequencies. Hypoglycaemia increases over the no error simulation, as expected. The difference in 95 % confidence band for time in severe (= 54 mg/dL) and mild (= 71 mg/dL) hypoglycaemia spans an acceptable [1 - 6 %] or 0. 24 - 1. 44 hours/day versus the no error simulation for 6 /day SMBG frequency. Conclusions: A MC simulation tool predicts long-term glycaemic control outcomes to test an adaptive control protocol in conditions of realistic variability and error. The protocol is shown to be robust, remaining effective and safe from hypoglycaemia compared to perfect no error or variability simulations, and clinical cohort control data. The protocol utilises {{the most commonly used}} forms of intervention (SMBG and MDI) and is thus applicable for most T 1 DM individuals...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) for the dosimetric verification of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In particular, the suitability of the method for verification of head and neck IMRT with extended field segments (≈ 20 cm superior–inferior), covering almost the entire detector area, was studied. A solution involving schematic modelling of backscatter materials has been established to account for non-uniform backscatter to the imager from supporting structures. 96 % of points within the IMRT fields evaluated passed a 'gamma' evaluation criterion of 2 %, 2 mm at isocentre at a dose rate of 100 MU min− 1 with this solution included. Only 79 % of points passed this gamma criterion without the correction for backscatter included. This work has also demonstrated {{the ability of the}} technique to detect systematic <b>delivery</b> <b>errors</b> in step and shoot IMRT. The technique identified a systematic overshoot on the first segment and an undershoot on the final segment. Results were verified by ion chamber measurements and agreed well with those reported in the literature, averaging approximately 0. 1 and 0. 3 MU for 100 and 300 MU min− 1 deliveries, respectively. MC portal verification has the potential to become a key tool in the verification of IMRT and can also facilitate selection of optimal delivery parameters, thus improving treatment accuracy. This approach {{can be applied to the}} verification of other new treatment techniques and should also enable development of methodologies to detect and correct for <b>delivery</b> <b>errors,</b> both before and during treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A central {{problem in}} today’s Internet is {{unsolicited}} bulk email: spam. The SMTP protocol lacks {{a mechanism for}} verifying {{the source of a}} message, and respective protocol extensions are still far from becoming standard. Content-based automatic spam filters are thus often used, and simple originbased filtering techniques like black- and whitelists are also very common. In this paper we first analyze the retry behavior of Internet mail sources upon <b>delivery</b> <b>errors.</b> We then propose a novel spam filtering approach, founded on the results of this analysis. It is based on the observed reaction of a mail source host to temporary errors. Furthermore, evaluation results from the production use of our filter on real mail servers are given, underlining its very good performance in practice. I...|$|R
