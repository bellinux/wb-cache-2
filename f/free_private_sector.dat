Household {{data suggest that the}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is more effective than the public <b>sector.</b> <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> companies provide services like container provision and providing timely and fixed collection time tables. Contrary to popular perception, fees charged by private companies are moderate. Public sector clients are charged fees even when the service is supposed to be <b>free.</b> Clients of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> providers are more satisfied than those of public sector providers. It is however, revealed that while public sector serve mainly the low incomes, the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> serves mainly the rich. In spite of these notable differences, clients of both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> perceive the problem of solid waste management (SWM) in Kampala to be very serious. The effectiveness of public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> operations in solid waste collection in Kampala is hampered by corruption and lack of transparency. Given the situation of open competition for clients involving both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Kampala, it is possible the public sector can operate effectively if they start commercial services officially like their <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> counterparts.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{involvement}} in solid waste collection, {{and the influence of}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> capacity and local governments‘ regulations on <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> performance. <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement in public service pro-vision evolved to deal with market and government failures (van Dijk, 2008 b). The public sector is playing a leading role of purchaser (buyer) on behalf of citi-zens through subsidies and/or user charges, whiles the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is taking on an increasing role as provider (seller) of public services, and being regulated by the public sector to correct market failures associated with ‗public good‘ nature of solid waste service. It is believed that <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement is a way to maintain market discipline and to bring <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> management and technical expertise and private finance into public service to achieve cost efficiency and better service provision (improve service quality) (Cointreau, 1994; Bartone, 2001; van Dijk, 2008 b). Even though <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement (PSI) provides opportunities for improved efficiency and service quality, the few studies on PSI in solid waste management in developing countries did not explore the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> performance to ascertain the expected gains and the factors influencing efficiency and service quality at the firm level. The main objective of this research is to examine the evolving involvement of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in urban solid waste collection, and the factors explaining dif-ferences in performance of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> companies.

40|$|Discussion of {{problems}} posed by defined benefit occupational pension plans to the <b>free</b> circulation of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{workers in the}} European Union has been mainly driven by the theoretical arguments, while little attempt {{has been made to}} support these arguments with empircal evidence. The paper's main objective is to fill this gap, modelling the role of expected pension portability losses on individual job mobility choices in a sample of European Union Member States with different pension portability rules, and estimating the model with a new longitudinal data set derived from the first two waves of the European Community Household Panel survey. Individual job mobility status is seen as endogenously determined through a comparative evaluation of expected benefits and costs from mobility. Following Heckman's (1979) two-step procedure, we consistently estimate wage equations parameters and individual mover/stayer structural wage differentials corrected for self-selectivity. Maximum likelihood estimatation of a structural probit equation accounting for estimated wage differentials allows the recovering of structural mobility costs parameters. In particular, occupational defined benefit pensions seem to act, through pension portability losses, as a significant impediment to individual labour mobility in all countries but Spain, while evidence for Denmark is consistent with full portability of defined contribution pensions. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a key engine of Africa's economic development. Yet, the most simple and fundamental question remains unanswered: how large is the African <b>private</b> <b>sector?</b> We present novel estimates {{of the size of}} the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in 50 African countries derived from the analysis of national accounts and labor market data. Our results point to a relatively large size of the African <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> National account data shows that this accounts for about 2 / 3 of total investments, 4 / 5 of total consumption and 3 / 4 of total credit. In relative terms, large <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> countries are concentrated in Western Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Niger, Senegal and Togo), Central Africa (Cameroun, Republic of Congo) and Eastern Africa (Kenya, Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania), with the addition of Mauritius. Countries with small <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> include a sample of oil-exporters (Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Libya and Nigeria), some of the poorest countries in the continent (Burundi, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Mali and Sao Tome e Principe), Zambia and Botswana. Over the last ten years, the size of the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> has been contracting significantly in oil exporting countries, although the variation in its size does not appear to be significantly correlated with growth performance. Labor market data reinforces the idea of a large <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> which provides about 90 % of total employment opportunities. However, most of this labor is informal and characterized by low productivity: permanent wage jobs in the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> account on average for only 10 % of total employment (a share similar to that provided by public administration and state owned enterprises). South Africa is the notable exception, with formal wage employment in the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> representing 46 % of total employment. Finally, we find evidence of negative <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> earning premiums, suggesting that market distortions abound. These are likely to prevent the efficient allocation of human resources, and to reduce the overall productivity of the African economies. <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> size, <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> development, <b>private</b> consumption, private investment, national accounts, <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> employment, <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> earnings, labor markets, Africa...|$|R

Indeed, results from the normalized cointegrating equation reveal that exchange rates are not significant in the long-run <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit equation. Similarly, short-run dynamics in the VEC model show that the coefficient of the ECT in the exchange rate equation is not significant although it bears the expected negative sign.
