60|$|Ormsgill's rifle went up {{and came}} in to the shoulder. With the same motion his <b>cheek</b> <b>dropped</b> upon the stock. He said nothing, but the labor {{purveyor}} stopped. Ormsgill swung down the rifle.|$|R
60|$|The blood, {{that had}} forsaken her {{astonished}} face, rushed as quickly back. His eyes, which had suddenly sparkled with an electrical glow, sank before hers. His hand <b>dropped,</b> and his <b>cheek</b> flushed {{with a dark}} embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|The tears {{gathered}} {{in her eyes}} and <b>dropped</b> over her <b>cheeks</b> as she raised her head to look at me affectionately when I said those words. I gently unclasped her arms and led her to George.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bhaer saw the <b>drops</b> on her <b>cheeks,</b> {{though she}} turned her head away. The sight seemed to touch him very much, for {{suddenly}} stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, [...] "Heart's dearest, why do you cry?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed all}} right and natural to their {{respective}} moods and {{the tone of the}} moment that free old Wessex manners should prevail, and Christopher stooped and <b>dropped</b> upon Picotee's <b>cheek</b> likewise such a farewell kiss as he had imprinted upon Ethelberta's.|$|R
60|$|How let {{her know}} he had seen that pretty act of devotion? And yet, if she heard him {{stealing}} away, it would be even worse. She took the pillow up, holding it as if reluctant to shake out the impress of his <b>cheek,</b> <b>dropped</b> it, and turned round.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand to Maynard, who pressed it, and sat down beside him in silence. Sir Christopher's heart began to swell at this unspoken sympathy; the tears would rise, would roll in great <b>drops</b> down his <b>cheeks.</b> The first tears he had shed since boyhood were for Anthony.|$|R
60|$|John--who {{had won a}} hard {{match at}} rackets {{a few days before}} against a more {{experienced}} opponent simply because of his perfect condition--was breathing hard. There was a dull patch of color in his <b>cheek,</b> <b>drops</b> of sweat stood upon his forehead. He controlled his voice with difficulty. Its tone was sharp and unfamiliar.|$|R
6000|$|Rosy paused with {{a sudden}} choke; but too proud to break down, she only wiped two <b>drops</b> off her <b>cheek</b> with the long ends of her little gray silk glove, set her lips, and {{remained}} mistress of herself, privately planning to cry all she liked when she was safely in the [...] "nice little room" [...] promised her.|$|R
60|$|Then he waited, {{with the}} rifle {{in his left}} hand, and that elbow on his knee, until there was a faint crackling, and a {{slightly}} larger patch of fur emerged from the thicket. He held his breath as he stiffened his left fingers on the barrel and <b>dropped</b> his <b>cheek</b> on the butt. There would, he knew, be only one shot, a long one, and, while it was not particularly easy to get the sight on that little patch, it was considerably handier to keep it there. Besides, {{he was not sure}} that the rear slide was high enough, for the light was puzzling. It might very well throw him a foot out in the elevation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Caitiffs!" [...] he cried, [...] "what heaven-directed blight [...] Involves each countenance with {{clouds of}} night! [...] What pearly <b>drop</b> the ashen <b>cheek</b> bedews!

60|$|While {{there was}} still light in the sky I {{set out for the}} cottage again, but soon found myself in such {{distress}} amongst the tangled weeds and grasses, which at every movement flung their stifling dust and seeds and pollen over me, that I was compelled to give up the attempt. With senseless tears <b>dropping</b> down my <b>cheeks,</b> I returned to the pool, and made my bed in the withered bracken.|$|R
60|$|But when, at last, {{she slowly}} lifted {{her eyes and}} held their gaze steadily, {{it was his own}} eyes that <b>dropped,</b> his own <b>cheek</b> that mantled red. She was much less embarrassed than he, while she betrayed her embarrassment not at all. She was aware of a flutter within, such as she had never known before, but in no way did it disturb her outward serenity. Joe, on the contrary, was {{obviously}} awkward and delightfully miserable.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had thrown}} her whole weight again upon his {{shoulders}} {{until she had}} forced {{him back to his}} seat. Then, with her locked hands again around his neck, she looked intently into his face. The varying color <b>dropped</b> from her <b>cheeks,</b> her eyes seemed to grow larger, the same look of rapt absorption and possession that had so transfigured her young face at the ball was fixed upon it now. Her lips parted slightly, she seemed to murmur rather than speak:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Going home, at last, to {{the lonely}} little room where no Christmas fire burned, no tree shone, no {{household}} group awaited her, she climbed the long, dark stairs, with <b>drops</b> on her <b>cheeks,</b> warmer than any melted snow-flake could have left, and opening her door paused on the threshold, smiling with wonder and delight, for in her absence some gentle spirit had remembered her. A fire burned cheerily upon the hearth, her lamp was lighted, a lovely rose-tree, in full bloom, {{filled the air}} with its delicate breath, and in its shadow lay a note from Rachel.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} M. Peyron couldn't imagine what had happened. Felix looked at Muriel. Muriel looked at Felix. The Englishman held out {{both his hands}} {{to her in a}} wild fervor of surprise. Muriel took them in her own, and looked deep into his eyes, while tears rose {{suddenly}} and <b>dropped</b> down her <b>cheeks,</b> one by one, unchecked. They couldn't say why, themselves; they didn't know wherefore; yet this unexpected echo of their own tongue, in the mouth of that strange and mysterious bird, thrilled through them instinctively with a strange, unearthly tremor. In some dim and unexplained way, they felt half unconsciously to themselves that this discovery was, perhaps, the first clue to the solution of the terrible secret whose meshes encompassed them.|$|R

60|$|A few tears {{gathered}} in her eyes, and <b>dropped</b> over her <b>cheeks</b> slowly as {{she paused and}} waited for his answer. He did not utter a word.

The fingers of the hand which supported his head were dented deep in his hair. They might have expressed hidden anger or hidden grief--it was hard to say which--there was no significant trembling in them. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, to tell the secret of his thoughts at that moment--the moment which was the crisis of his life and the crisis of hers.|$|R

60|$|I {{peered into}} the darkness, {{thrusting}} out the lamps, and this was what their light fell on--this at the very dream of which my soul sickens! There, facing us, his back resting against the rock, and his hands splayed on either side upon the floor, sat the eunuch--dead! His eyes and mouth were open, his fat <b>cheeks</b> <b>dropped</b> down, his thin hair yet seemed to bristle, and on his countenance was frozen such a stamp of hideous terror as well might turn the beholder's brain. And lo! fixed to his chin, by its hinder claws, hung that grey and mighty bat, which, flying forth when we entered the pyramid, vanished in the sky, but, returning, had followed us to its depths. There it hung upon the dead man's chin slowly rocking itself to and fro, and {{we could see the}} fiery eyes shining in its head.|$|R
60|$|The whole refracting apparatus, {{with its}} brass {{fittings}} and rings of prisms, glittered and sparkled like a domeshaped shrine of diamonds, containing not a lamp, but some sacred flame, dominating the sea. And Linda, the keeper, in black, with a pale face, drooped low {{in a wooden}} chair, alone with her jealousy, far above the shames and passions of the earth. A strange, dragging pain as if somebody were pulling her about brutally by her dark hair with bronze glints, made her put her hands up to her temples. They would meet. They would meet. And she knew where, too. At the window. The sweat of torture fell in <b>drops</b> on her <b>cheeks,</b> while the moonlight in the offing closed as if with a colossal bar of silver {{the entrance of the}} Placid Gulf--the sombre cavern of clouds and stillness in the surf-fretted seaboard.|$|R
60|$|It {{lengthened}} slowly, {{until it}} reached to the ceiling. As it lengthened, it grew bright and luminous.

Soft brown eyes, tender and melancholy, looked at me through the unearthly light in the mist. The head and the rest of the face broke next slowly on my view. Then the figure gradually revealed itself, moment by moment, downward and downward to the feet. She stood before me as I had last seen her, in her purple-merino dress, with the black-silk apron, with the white handkerchief tied loosely round her neck. She stood before me, in the gentle beauty that I remembered so well; and looked at me as she had looked when she gave me her last kiss--when her tears had <b>dropped</b> on my <b>cheek.</b>|$|R

60|$|Next day, by noon, I {{was up and}} dressed, and sat {{wrapped in}} a shawl by the nursery hearth.

Yet, I thought, I {{ought to have been}} happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama.

6000|$|It {{would look}} {{a little too much}} like a romance here to repeat all the kind things he said to me on that occasion, but I can't omit one passage. As he saw the tears <b>drop</b> down my <b>cheek,</b> he pulls out a fine cambric {{handkerchief}}, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked his hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he checked his hand, and tossed the handkerchief to me to do it myself. I took the hint immediately, and with a kind of pleasant disdain, [...] "How, my lord," [...] said I, [...] "have you kissed me so often, and don't you know whether I am painted or not?

6000|$|But Margaret Owen put {{her hand}} on his {{shoulder}} and said softly, [...] "John, let us hear him out." [...] And John, recalled by that gentle touch, listened once more. Then Paul pleaded his case powerfully again. He quoted Scripture to them; he argued with them, after their own fashion, and down to their own comprehension, text by text; he pitted his own critical and exegetical faculty against the Apostle's. Last of all, he turned to his mother, who, tearful still and heart-broken with disappointment, yet looked admiringly upon her learned, eloquent boy, and said to her tenderly, [...] "Remember, mother, you yourself were once in love. You yourself once stood, night after night, leaning on the gate, waiting with your heart beating for a footstep that you knew so well. You yourself once counted the days and the hours and the minutes till the next meeting came." [...] And Margaret Owen, touched to the heart by that simple appeal, kissed him fervently a dozen times over, the hot tears <b>dropping</b> on his <b>cheek</b> meanwhile; and then, contrary to all the rules of their austere Church, she flung her arms round her husband too, and kissed him passionately the first time for twenty years, with all the fervour of a floodgate loosed.

60|$|In the rounded, untouched, and untroubled {{freshness}} of {{her cheek and}} chin, and the forward droop of her slender neck, she appeared a girl of fifteen; in her developed figure and the maturer drapery of her full skirts she seemed a woman; in her combination of naive recklessness and perfect understanding of her person she was both. In spite of a few school-books that jauntily swung from a strap in her gloved hand, she bore no resemblance to a pupil; in her pretty gown of dotted muslin with bows of blue ribbon on the skirt and corsage, and a cluster of roses in her belt, she was as inconsistent and incongruous to the others as a fashion-plate {{would have been in}} the dry and dog-eared pages before them. Yet she carried it off with a demure mingling of the naivete of youth and the aplomb of a woman, and as she swept down the narrow aisle, burying a few small wondering heads in the overflow of her flounces, there was no doubt of her reception in the arch smile that dimpled her <b>cheek.</b> <b>Dropping</b> a half curtsey to the master, the only suggestion of her equality with the others, she took her place at one of the larger desks, and resting her elbow on the lid began to quietly remove her gloves.

6000|$|... "Have I {{followed}} this man {{simply as a}} duty? Have I lain awake thinking of it till I have given to the pursuit such an amount of energy as no duty can require?

All that has been nothing. I am a policeman in search of him, and am the natural enemy of a murderer. Of course in the ordinary way I would not have spared him; but the ordinary way would have sufficed. Had he escaped me I could have laughed at all that. But he took that poor lad's life!" [...] Here he looked sadly into her face, and she could see that there was a tear within his eye. [...] "That was much, but that was not all. That lad was your brother, him whom you so dearly loved. He shot down the poor child before his father's face, simply because he had said that he would tell the truth. When you wept, when you tore your hair, when you flung yourself in sorrow upon the body, I told myself that either he or I must die. And now you bid me be merciful." [...] Then the big tears <b>dropped</b> down his <b>cheeks,</b> and he began to wail himself,--hardly like a man.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{pomegranate}} {{journey from}} orchard to supermarket is very complex and pomegranates {{are subjected to}} the variety of static and dynamic loads {{that could result in}} this damage and bruise occurring. Bruise area and bruise volume are the most important parameters to evaluate fruit damage occurred in harvest and postharvest stages. The bruising is defined as damage to fruit flesh usually with no abrasion of the peel. The two different types of dynamic loading which can physically cause fruit bruising are impact and vibration. The impact and vibration loadings may occur during picking or sorting as the pomegranates are dropped into storage bins and during transportation. The focus of this work was on the impact loading as this appeared to be the most prevalent. In view of the limitations of conventional testing methods (ASTM D 3332 Standard Test Methods for Mechanical Shock Fragility of Products), the method and procedure for determining dropping bruise boundary of fruit were also established by adapting free-fall dropping tests. Materials and Methods: After the ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates had been selected, they were numbered, and the weight and dimension of each sample were measured and recorded. Firmness in cheek region of each fruit was also measured. Fruit firmness was determined by measuring the maximum force during perforating the sample to a depth of 10 mm at a velocity of 100 mm min- 1 with an 8 mm diameter cylindrical penetrometer mounted onto a STM- 5 Universal Testing Machine (SANTAM, Design CO. LTD., England). Free-fall dropping tests with a series of drop heights (6, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 60 cm) were conducted on fresh ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates. Three samples were used for each dropping height, and each sample was subjected to impact on two different positions. Before the test was started, it was necessary to control the sample's <b>drop</b> position. The <b>cheek</b> of sample was placed on the fruit holder. An aluminum plate mounted on upper part of the piezoelectric force sensor was the dropping impact surface of the device. After dropping impact, the sample was caught by hand to prevent a second impact due to sample rebound. After impact, the samples were stored at room temperature for 48 h, during which time bruise tissues and arils turned brown. The bruise area and bruise volume of each sample were calculated according to equations (1 and 2). Results and Discussion: Dropping impact acceleration versus time curves for the typical samples at ten drop heights are shown in figure 5. Drop height notably affected the impact acceleration. The peak force increased while contact times decreased with increasing drop height, which resulted in an increase of peak acceleration. Figure 6 shows the dropping impact velocity change during contact by theoretical calculation. The results showed that the velocities at the beginning of contact and the rebound velocities of the samples increased with increasing the drop height. Critical drop height of pomegranate in certain bruise area was determined and linear relationship between drop height and bruise volume for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates were obtained. It is clear that there were obvious differences between dropping bruise boundaries of pomegranates and the conventional damage boundary of products (as shown in figure 9). For the conventional damage boundary, the vertical line, critical velocity (Vc), represents the velocity change below which no damage occurs, regardless of the peak pulse acceleration. The horizontal line, critical acceleration (AC), represents the acceleration at which the product will be damaged if velocity exceeds VC. At the same time, for a conventional product, there is only one damage boundary at one shock condition. However, for fruit, a change in drop height (velocity) will lead to a change in bruise ratio. A series of bruise boundaries can be determined for different bruise ratios. Moreover, even if the velocity approaches zero, the fruit can still be bruised if its acceleration exceeds a certain value. These relationships provide an effective basis to predict and control drop bruising, which may be achieved through the design of reasonable cushioning packaging for fruit. Conclusions: This research applied the concept of dropping bruise for pomegranate fruits. Because of the limitations in using conventional testing methods to test product of a viscoelastic nature, such as fruit, free fall dropping tests were adapted to determine dropping bruise fragility and bruise boundary for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates at different drop heights. For viscoelastic products such as fruit, even if the dropping impact velocity approached zero, the fruit could be bruised as long as the impact acceleration exceeded a certain value (critical acceleration). A series of bruise boundaries can be established for different levels of bruise ratios, i. e., a contour of constant bruise ratio can be drawn on the velocity acceleration plane...|$|R
