5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species. Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> is a flatfish, and {{the left}} eye has {{migrated}} during the fish's development {{so that it is}} {{on the right side of}} the head. However, in this fish, it has not moved as far as in bottom-dwelling flatfish and the fish can probably see forwards. The <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> can swim in a vertical position and both sides of its body are a speckled brown colour, but the left side is rather paler than the right. This fish is used for human consumption and is caught mostly by trawling. Greenpeace considers the fishery unsustainable and has added the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> to its seafood red list.|$|E
50|$|Its {{physical}} appearance suggests {{it to be}} a vigorous swimmer that can swim in a vertical position. Vertical swimming has been observed during tagging experiments. However, video analyzing of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> behavior in front of a bottom trawl showed no sign of swimming in a vertical position. Even though most <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> are caught in bottom fishing gears (trawl, longline and gillnet) they have also been caught in surface drift nets which indicates that they can have a pelagic occurrence. Stomach analysis has also shown that the diet consists mostly of pelagic or bathypelagic organisms. Even though the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> is a flatfish it does at times behave more like a roundfish.|$|E
5000|$|Nergård Senja AS - is {{a company}} owned of Nergård AS. the company has {{factories}} in Gryllefjord, Senjahopen and Grunnfarnes and they have also one Receiving station for fish in Fjordgård. They are one of North Norway biggest providers of whitefish in quantity. The most important fish to the company are cod, haddock, saithe and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut.</b> Dryfish is produced by cod and saithe. Frozen fillets are produced by haddock, while the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> is round frozen.|$|E
50|$|Fishes of {{the area}} include Arctic char, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> polar cod, cuttlefish, wolf fish, sea {{scorpion}} and Greenland shark. Aquatic mammals are dominated by seals (ringed, hooded, harbor, bearded and harp seal) which feed on fish in winter (mostly polar cod) and crustaceans in summer. Larger species include Atlantic walrus, narwhal and sometimes beluga whale. Atlantic walrus feeds on mussels, fish and ringed seals that urges ringed seals to disappear from the area when walruses stay there for prolonged periods. Narwhals consume polar cod, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> cuttlefish and pelegaec crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|Ittoqqortoormiit lies near large {{populations of}} shrimp and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> but the {{presence}} of sea ice prevents the exploitation of these resources year-round, {{and as a result}} fishing has never been extensively developed in the municipality.|$|E
50|$|The second-largest sector by {{employment}} is Greenland's fishing industry. The commercial fishing fleet consists of approximately 5,000 dinghies, 300 cutters, and 25 trawlers. While cod was formerly the main catch, today the industry centers on cold-water shrimp and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut.</b>|$|E
50|$|Animals {{that can}} be found in the park's forests include wolves, black bears, lynx, beavers, and moose. Peregrine falcons can be found on the fjord's cliffs.

5000|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{has added}} the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> to its seafood red list.

50|$|The roughhead {{grenadier}} is landed as a by-catch when fishing for <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus). In a study off {{the east coast}} of Greenland, more males were taken by trawling and more females by long line. This seemed to be due to the females being in the depth range 1000 to 1500 m while the males predominated at shallower depths.|$|E
5000|$|In the North-West Atlantic {{landings}} {{have decreased}} from 4.2 million tons {{in the early}} 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> together with flounder and grenadier.|$|E
50|$|The bay {{is home to}} the Cumberland Sound beluga whale, {{a species}} known to reside year-round in the sound, with summers spent at the {{northern}} end. As well as ringed, bearded, harp, harbour and hooded seals, there are Arctic char, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> and other fish. Birds such as gulls, ducks, and geese also migrate and spend the spring and summer in Cumberland Sound, and ptarmigan and ravens remain year-round.|$|E
5000|$|NAFO is {{implementing}} the Precautionary Approach {{that takes into}} account scientific uncertainties and thus allows for improved protection of the resources. Recently NAFO Adopted the MSE (Management Strategy Evaluation) for the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> stock. This approach considers a survey based harvest control rule (HCR) in setting the TAC. NAFO was the first regional fisheries management organization to regulate the fishery of a species (thorny skate) belonging to skates or sharks (elasmobranchs).|$|E
50|$|Narwhals have a {{very intense}} summer feeding society. One study {{published}} in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate. The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979. The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet. A year later, the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed. Arctic cod represented 57%, and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> 29% in 1979. The deep-water fish - halibut, redfish (Sebastes marinus), and polar cod (Arctogadus glacialis) - are found in the diet of the males, which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than 500 m below sea level. The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Cumberland Sound {{population}} was split off {{as distinct from}} the Baffin Island population and assessed as Threatened by COSEWIC, pending listing under the Species at Risk Act. Research and monitoring is under way into the population dynamics and ecology of the population to inform conservation and recovery strategies. While current harvest quotas appear sustainable, there are concerns {{about the impact of}} noise from increased boat traffic as well as competition over <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> with human fisheries.|$|E
50|$|On March 7, 1992, Greenland made an {{agreement}} with Russia over fishing exploitation in their waters and in 2010 made new negotiations in St. Petersburg. The agreement was that Greenland would be permitted to fish for cod and haddock in the Barents Sea, while Russia would be permitted to fish for redfish and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> in East and West Greenland. Estimates are that in 2011 Russia would fish some 750 tonnes of redfish in Greenlandic waters.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is the {{mainstay}} of the economy, with stocks of Atlantic cod, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and Greenland shark. A variety of mammal species are harvested: ringed seal, bearded seal, harp seal, hooded seal, and walrus. There is a seasonal catch of narwhal and beluga - on rare occasions pilot whales are caught. Capelin and fin whales have been observed at Niaqornat as late as in November in recent years. Like other settlements in northwestern Greenland, Niaqornat experiences the effects of global warming.|$|E
50|$|Straddling {{stocks are}} usually pelagic, rather than demersal. Demersal species move less than pelagic species, since {{they tend to}} relate to bottom topography. Pelagic species are more mobile, their {{movements}} influenced by ocean temperatures {{and the availability of}} zooplankton as food. Example pelagic fish are capelin, herring, whiting, mackerel and redfish, There are, however, a few demersal species that are straddling, such as the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> migrates in feeding/spawning migrations to Greenland in the west and to the Faeroes in the east.|$|E
5000|$|The Turbot War (known in Spain as [...] "Guerra del Fletán") was an {{international}} fishing dispute between Canada (supported by the United Kingdom and Ireland) and Spain (supported by the European Union and Iceland) in which Canada stopped a Spanish fishing trawler from Galicia in international waters and arrested its crew. Canada claimed that European Union factory ships were illegally overfishing <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> {{also known as}} Greenland turbot, on the Grand Banks, just outside Canada's declared 200 nmi km exclusive economic zone (EEZ).|$|E
50|$|The Restaurant Ulo serves Greenlandic cuisine and is {{recognized}} as one of the very best in the whole country. The restaurant work hard to serve as much local food as possible and produce most of it themselves. Ingredients such as musk-ox, reindeer, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> Arctic hare, ptarmigan, wolffish, mussels, sea urchins, redfish and much more are on the menu daily. Herbs are collected in the fells: sheep sorrel, knot weed, mountain sorrel, lousewort, northern marsh yellowcress, common mouse ear, knotted pearlwort and many more.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} since the cod moratorium, federal {{fisheries}} policy makers and scientists had scrambled to attempt to find a replacement species that could at least reinject economic stimulus into the affected regions. The ground fishery, while a fraction of what it had been during the cod years, did have some bright spots - one of which was the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> commonly known in Canada as turbot. The turbot had decreased in demand due to a common dislike for the taste in the European Union.|$|E
50|$|Its {{morphology}} {{with the}} left eye positioned on the dorsal ridge of the forehead gives it an appearance of a cyclops when looking straight at it. The central position of the left eye in the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> probably gives it a much wider range of peripheral vision in comparison to other flatfish where the eye has migrated completely. The body shape is elongated and compressed dorsal-ventrally and muscles on both sides are equally developed. Both sides are pigmented; however the left blind side is slightly lighter in color than the right side.|$|E
5000|$|HB Grandi’s freezer {{trawlers}} {{are large}} and well equipped vessels that catch and produce <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> redfish, cod, haddock, saithe, silver smelt and mackerel as well as various other species. The catch is processed {{as soon as it}} comes on board and each species goes through a specific process to ensure quality; size-graded, whole frozen, filleted, IQF or headed and gutted [...] The result is a great quality product from the pristine and unpolluted sea around Iceland. In 2013 HB Grandi’s five freezer trawlers caught a total of 33.500 tons.|$|E
5000|$|The diet of the {{hooded seal}} is {{composed}} primarily of various amphipods (crustaceans), eeuphausiids (krill), and fish, including Atlantic Argentine, capelin, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> cod, herring, and redfish. [...] They also {{are known to}} eat squid, sea stars, and mussels. Relative to the other species, hooded seals consume 3 times the proportion of redfish; percentages of capelin were similar in relation to closely related species. [...] Capelin is considered a more common choice of sustenance during the winter season. Their diet {{is considered to be}} rich in lipids and fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|Bycatch is {{typically}} managed in cold-water shrimp trawling, {{and rates of}} bycatch are accordingly low, and the capture of sea turtles is rare in cold temperate waters. Bycatch is mostly reduced {{by the use of}} Nordmøre grids, which reduce the numbers of cod, haddock, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and redfish caught during shrimp trawls. The Nordmøre grid was invented by the Norwegian fisherman Paul Brattøy, primarily as a means of excluding jellyfish from shrimp catches, and introduced in 1989. This innovation causes a minimal reduction in the quantity of shrimp caught, but can reduce the amounts of bycatch by around 97%.|$|E
50|$|Narwhals have a {{relatively}} restricted and specialized diet. Their prey is predominantly composed of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> polar and Arctic cod, cuttlefish, shrimp and armhook squid. Additional items found in stomachs have included wolffish, capelin, skate eggs and sometimes rocks, accidentally ingested when whales feed near the bottom. Due {{to the lack of}} well-developed dentition in the mouth, narwhals are believed to feed by swimming towards prey until it is within close range and then sucking it with considerable force into the mouth. It is thought that the beaked whales, which have similarly reduced dentition, also suck up their prey.|$|E
5000|$|Found {{primarily}} in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialized Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> with other fish such as polar cod {{making up the}} remainder of their diet. Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes. In the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to 1,500 m in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. Narwhals, like most toothed whales, communicate with [...] "clicks", [...] "whistles", and [...] "knocks".|$|E
50|$|The {{main task}} of the team of {{scientists}} of the institute is conducting annual studies to help determine the total allowable catch of commercial fish species, invertebrates, algae and marine mammals. The main focus is on cod, haddock, capelin, herring, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> the Barents Sea population of the Kamchatka crab, and salmon. The Institute's area of responsibility includes the northern waters near European Russia - the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, the White Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean - as well as freshwater lakes in the Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Regions, the Komi Republic, and the Nenets Autonomous District.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{majority}} of Greenland is covered by permanent glaciers, the sea is the source for most food. Seafood dishes include various fishes (often smoked), mussels, and shrimp. Ammassat or capelin, a fish in the salmon family is commonly eaten and can easily be dried. Atlantic halibut, redfish, deepwater redfish, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> and lumpfish are fished from the west coast, as are Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) and shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), but these two are eaten {{only as a last}} resort. Arctic char is fished off the east coast. The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is rarely eaten because it is poisonous but can be edible after a complicated preparation of either boiling the meat repeatedly or fermenting the meat.|$|E
50|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
50|$|Belugas occupy {{mostly the}} western side of the Cumberland Sound in spring and early autumn. In summer, they are found mainly in Clearwater Fiord and {{adjacent}} bays where they are reported to feed on a large diversity of fish and invertebrate species including squid, tube worms, caplin, Greenland cod and Atlantic cod. In late autumn and early winter, belugas move to the centre of the Sound, diving to depths of 300 m or more to feed on deep-water species such as <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut.</b> Local hunters also report that belugas at the floe-edge in spring prey mainly on Arctic cod and turbot under the ice. In winter, belugas move to {{the eastern side of the}} Sound near the mouth, following open water.|$|E
5000|$|Narwhals exhibit {{seasonal}} migrations, with a {{high fidelity}} of return to preferred, ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters. In summer months, they move closer to coasts, usually in pods of 10-100. In the winter, they move to offshore, deeper waters under thick pack ice, surfacing in narrow fissures in the sea ice, or leads. [...] As spring comes, these leads open up into channels and the narwhals return to the coastal bays. Narwhals from Canada and West Greenland winter regularly in the pack ice of Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along the continental slope with less than 5% open water and high densities of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut.</b> [...] Feeding in the winter accounts for a much larger portion of narwhal energy intake than in the summer.|$|E
