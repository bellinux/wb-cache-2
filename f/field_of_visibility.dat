Angela Oels’ 2005 paper summarized the initial forays into governmentality-based analyses for climate change discourses and suggested that the functioning governmentality of the issue had shifted since the 1980s, from a biopower-based discourse to one rooted in advanced liberal government. [...] She demonstrated a method of discourse analysis particularly suited for addressing climate change, examining objectives, <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility,</b> technical aspects, forms of knowledge and formation of identities. Oels also provided some categories into which discourses can be sorted. These categories were also used by Karin Bäckstrand and Eva Lövbrand, beginning in 2006 with analysis of tree-planting initiatives stemming from the Kyoto Protocol. [...] Their analysis of competing discourses in categories of ecological modernization, green governmentality, and civic environmentalism revealed areas of overlap and potential cooperation.|$|R

Image analysis techniques and control rules are presented as the basic components of a behaviour-based robot system.

The approaching, assembling, and continual handling of the gripper tool is illustrated. For the purpose of object inspection the head-camera system or the manipulator (carrying the object) are controlled to reach a desired size, resolution and orientation of the depicted object.

40|$|Abstract This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} femme gaze and desire {{in relation to a}} range of heterosexual fashion advertisements from the British edition of the mainstream fashion magazine Vogue. It considers the lasting legacy of heterosexual feminist and lesbian feminist constructions of the gazing subject, particularly in terms of masculinity, trans-sex identification and masquerading. Both of these fields of knowledge have failed to recognize feminine and femme-inine viewing subjects and to include them in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> independently, without recourse to masculinity. The article considers possibilities for resistant femme visibility, identification, and desire. It argues through the analysis of fashion images that the concepts of femme-nity and femme-nine are useful in criticizing prevailing regulatory norms of perception and normative expectations on gender, as well as in denaturalizing the assumed relationship between the gaze, gender, sexuality, and desire...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{insights into}} Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programs in Queensland. CLIL programs use {{a second language}} as the medium of instruction to deliver mainstream subjects, such as science, maths or history, {{as a form of}} intensive language learning. The paper presents an analysis of pedagogical considerations and domains, elicited from interviews with CLIL programs directors at different Queensland schools, using a variety of second languages in their CLIL programs. The analysis is guided by a synthesis of CLIL pedagogies and theories of bilingual education, as well as a research framework inspired by three concepts: <b>Fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>Visibility,</b> Technical aspects <b>of</b> program enactment, and Forms of Knowledge. The paper concludes that CLIL is a promising teaching design model as a response to renewed calls for languages learning in Australia. However, the demands of CLIL programs require CLI program directors and teachers to apply a multitude of pedagogical considerations: subject-specific concepts; available teaching resources in the second language translation and simplification of materials; students 2 ̆ 7 access to learning through modified language.

More accurately, the goal is to clarify the relationship between what this author calls "vertical" Being and the aspect of reciprocal exclusivity, or incompossibility, of the segments <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> through which we have access to it. This structural characteristic is studied principally on the levels of the perception, our relationships with the others, the language and other human institutions. First, the author of the paper elucidates what he think is the reference point of this ontological philosophy, that is to say the concept <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> By means <b>of</b> an interpretation of the three fundamental structures <b>of</b> the <b>visibility,</b> the visible, the invisible, and the vision (voyant), the author demonstrates the profound ontological unity of the element <b>of</b> the <b>visibility.</b> The concept <b>of</b> the "institution" (Stiftung, institution) is then introduced to demonstrate how the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> the <b>visibility</b> is internally organized in a manner that surpasses [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating design {{decisions}} is {{an important}} factor in a post-positivist design process. Understanding how people move in space {{is an important}} part of the evaluation processes. However, making accurate predictions of occupants? movements is a challenge mainly due to the differences between individual occupants, their unique preferences in relation to environmental qualities, the types of scenarios with which they become engaged, and multiple dimensions of the environmental factors that affect occupants? decisions. This study suggests a model to simulate and visualize mandatory occupancy scenarios, which are task-based, and optional occupancy scenarios, which are attraction-based. The impact of environmental qualities is largely overlooked in existing simulation models in both of these scenarios. Existing simulation models for mandatory scenarios are often based on finding shortest or fastest paths and for optional scenarios mainly rely on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> The original contribution of the simulation models that this study suggests is simultaneous consideration of environmental qualities, path simplicity, and visibility in addition to desires such as travel time or distance minimization. The integration of these models unlocks new potentials that the individual components do not include. The individual techniques that will be used to develop the occupancy simulation models are validated in the exiting literature experimentally. However, this study does not include conducting field studies to validate the integrated model. If the observed walking trails of humans are provided, the suggested models in this study can be validated through a fine-tuning process that reproduces the observed trails. The simulation results can finally be used for evaluation purposes to help designers at the design phase and facility managers in after design phases to make informed decisions. This study provides a software solution that implements the suggested model to support its feasibility. This software uses a Building Information Model (BIM) to represent the built environment, an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate the occupants, a list of research evidence to encode agent?s reactions to the environment, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model to represent the tasks in mandatory scenarios, and the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> (isovist) to simulate an occupant?s viewshed. In this software, evaluation is a process of data query from the information collected by the agents during the simulations. The data query logic can be set according to the interests of designers or facility managers...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{democratic}} regime {{as a specific}} visibility regime. It takes as its starting point the idea that visibility is a complex sociological category. The <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> interweaves aesthetic and semiotic relations, in other words it crosscuts the domains of the perceptual and the symbolic. Visibility {{can be described as}} a relational, strategic and processual feature that characterises human relations. More specifically, contemporary society is arranged into regimes of visibility that concur in the definition and management of power, representation, public opinon, violence and social control. Whereas potential ambivalences are inherent to all visibility effects, regimes contribute to specify and activate contextual determinations of the visible. Norberto Bobbio defined democracy as the exercise of 'power in public', while Jürgen Habermas characterized the public sphere as an open and accessible discoursive space. But what is properly public in the public sphere and how can it be conceptualized in terms of visibility? What are the specific consequences of visible as opposed to invisible power? The paper provides an attempt at answering these questions by conceptualising and understanding the democratic visibility regime from a transdisciplinary perspective, joining together contributions from interactionism, cultural studies and political science...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{societies}} have a growing {{need for information}} and numbers for governing social life. Numbers {{have the ability to}} represent a complex reality in a simplified and linear form, easily communicated. Far from being the product of a mere technical process, numbers are the result of a process that “is fundamentally social – an artifact of human action, imagination, ambition, accomplishment” (Espeland, W. N., and Stevens, M. L., 2008. A sociology of quantification. European journal of sociology, 49 (3), 401 – 436, p. 431). In the modern policymaking climate, numbers become key mechanisms for simplifying, classifying, comparing and evaluating. Along with this, the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> evaluative objects, meanings and understandings (Dean, M., 2010. Governmentality. Power and rule in modern societies. 2 nd ed. London: Sage) are re-framed consistently with what Clarke, J. (2004. Changing welfare, changing states. New direction in social policy. London: Sage) terms a ‘performance/ evaluation nexus’ that links effort, values, purposes and self understanding to measures and comparisons of outputs (Ball, S. J., 2012. Performativity, commodification and commitment: an I-Spy guide to the neoliberal university. British journal of educational studies, 601, 17 – 28). In this paper, we focus on the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> higher education (HE), where numbers, in the form of performance indicators, benchmarks and headline targets, are frequently used to strategically orient the sector towards the objectives and goals of the Bologna Process and of the overall Europe 2020 agenda (Waldow, F., 2014.

We aim to offer a comparative overview of the complex spectrum of metrics, provided at the supranational level, within the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> higher education by focusing on the European Research Area (ERA) in order to map and analyse some of the crucial issues in play. A second ambition {{of this paper is to}} move from a mapping and analytical perspective to a deconstruction of a specific subset of research metrics, with the aim of challenging the ‘self-evident truths’ and the dominant conventional wisdom that define current European metrics in order to bring into question whether they contribute to restructuring the universities’ research environments, affecting research policies and procedures.

40|$|The general problem <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> {{reduction}} by aerosols is {{explored in}} order to identify the conditions necessary for determination of the roles of individual chemical species. The particle extinction coefficient depends on the distribution of chemical species with respect to particle size and from particle to particle within each size range. Single particle measurements of composition and optical properties would be required to determine directly the chemical species contributions to the extinction coefficient. Several special cases are identified which would allow exact calculations based on available data. The composition and optical properties of particles must be uniform within each size interval if composition distribution data are to be used. Corroborative data are necessary to ensure that important contributors are not neglected since many chemical species are not readily measured. Estimation of the species mass extinction efficiencies by statistical analysis of chemical data obtained from total filler samples also requires that the normalized species mass distribution be invariant. The results <b>of</b> two <b>field</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> reduction in arid regions of the southwestern United States are used to explore the validity of these assumptions. The two methods, estimation from size-composition distribution data and from total filter data, yield similar estimates of species contributions to the extinction coefficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the biopolitics of video {{activism}} vis-à-vis racialized police violence. It is written {{against the backdrop}} of recent developments in the critique of two central concepts in field of biopolitics, namely Giorgio Agamben’s bare life and Michel Foucault’s biopower. Offsetting their respective framework, Alexander G. Weheliye (et al.) has introduced the imposition of race onto bodies as anterior to biopolitics. I incorporate this in a critique of Pasi Väliaho’s notion of biopolitical screens. To facilitate grounded theorizing, a field study of police accountability video activist groups in the United States was conducted. I argue that their observed practices should be seen as forms of embodied counter-surveillance and I situate them in the racially saturated <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> specific to the U. S.  context. Moreover, I argue that the practices entail an extension of corporealities which is not inherently political in the sense of overt discursive iconography. It is, however, ideologically disrupting in how it networks politicized bodies through time and space. I conclude that raising the video camera to “look back” in the face of racializing assemblages constitutes a rights claim to a political subjectivity, however not necessarily in terms of polity or citizenship.  Instead, the media practices are transversal and hold the potential to entail a political subjectivity ontologically anterior to state sovereignty...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Visibility in {{the media}} is {{considered}} important for organizations, as it is alleged to affect their reputation, public legitimacy, and stakeholder relations. Strategies for media relations often discern corporations, public organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The media attention for those organizations is, however, often studied in isolation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce the concept of media positioning to compare media coverage for corporations, public organizations, and NGOs. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative content analysis of the media coverage of 61 Dutch organizations was conducted. The comparison focused on three aspects of media positioning: prominence, context, and evaluation. Findings Public organizations and corporations were most similar, whereas corporations and NGOs differed most strongly in their media positioning. Corporations appeared most prominently {{in the media}}. While corporations and public organizations were more often related to organizational issues, NGOs were more often linked to substantial issues and received more positive coverage. Originality/value Insight into the content, amount, and tone of organizational media coverage is crucial for the formulation of public relations strategies by corporate communication professionals. The analysis shows whether and how the prominence, context, and evaluation differs among corporations, public organizations, and NGOs. The findings shed light on institutional factors that affect the visibility of different types of organizations, thus enabling future scholars in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> analyses in corporate communication to refine theories on drivers and characteristics of media coverage regarding different types of organizations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the thesis}} we {{describe}} our results in ray shooting (RS), {{which is a}} well known problem in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> The problem is difficult {{in spite of its}} simple definition: For a given oriented half-line and a set of objects, find out the first object intersected by the half-line if such an object exists. A naive algorithm has the time complexity O(N), where N is the number of objects. The naive algorithm is practically inapplicable in global illumination applications for a scene with a high number of objects, due its huge time requirements. In this thesis, we deal with heuristic ray shooting algorithms (RSA) that use additional spatial data structures. We put stress on average-case complexity and we particularly investigate with RSA based on spatial hierarchies. In the thesis we deal with two major topics. We introduce a RS computation model and a performance model. Based on these two models we develop a methodology for comparing various RSA for a set of experiments performed on a set of scenes. We compare common heuristic RSA based on BSP trees, kd-trees, octrees, bounding volume hierarchies, uniform grids, and three types of hierarchical grids using a set of 30 scenes from Standard Procedural Database. Further the thesis presents several techniques for decreasing the time and space complexity for RSA based on kd-trees.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes a sociological analysis based on Bourdieu field to understand the variation of reception the French OS production have had among the Anglo-Saxon field. The paper aims to underline some key elements, which can explain the differences of reception experienced by the French OS scientists. The paper opted for a general review using historical data; reviews of OS literature; and Google scholar, Web of Science and major OS Journal data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} environmental work, from resource extraction projects to environmental assessment, and from Land Art to eco-criticism, privileges harm rhetorically. This means, among other things, that such work carries {{along with it}} a sense of past, present, and future destruction. As a result, resource extraction companies, and the settler-colonial State, have a conception of the violence that they create and that they participate in. I show that the conception they have requires an infrastructural framework, one which I read out of environmental assessment and land-management documents. These documents set the visual conditions not just for extraction projects, but for environmental objects in general. The Environmental Humanities have rarely treated the rhetoric of management. But I argue that it not only materially produces their object of study, but also produces the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> in which that object appears and others don't—establishing the criteria for what counts as a claim and what registers as an effect. I suggest that this creates a visual regime which finds a parallel in, for instance, the work of Edward Burtynsky and Timothy Morton. However, while these discourses try to manage the appearance of violence, suggesting that ongoing destruction can't be seen, they can't control it. Via {{a reading of the}} Land Art movement, I show how landscape is one place where these conflicts appear.

40|$|An {{exhibition}} entitled Love and Democracy was organised by Paweł Leszkowicz {{for the private}} Grażyna Kulczyk Gallery in Poznań in 2005. A larger versijon of it was shown at the Centre for Contemporary Art in Gdańsk in 2006. The curator gathered together various works related to the title. These included individual voices on different kinds of sexuality, love, and desire (e. g., Katarzyna Korzeniecka). Some of the artworks presented a play and change of identity (Maciej Osika). Others, more related to social and political problems, included the aforementioned photos in the Let us see exhibition, and Aleksandra Polisiewicz’s film The Re-animation of Democracy – The March of Equality Moves On, 2005 [fig. 6], which documents a rally in Warsaw supporting the banned Equality March that was brutally suppressed on November 19, 2005 in Poznań. Thus the exhibition also collected some of the earlier strategies, i. e. exploring the issue of Otherness, becoming familiar with Otherness, and destruction of identity. Within {{the context of this}} exhibition, the Other stops being an Other, and starts to be one of many of us. The exhibition showed a pluralistic vision of different existing sexualities and identities. Paweł Leszkowicz described it as “plural love stories, multiple sexual narratives, various images of femininity and masculinity”. 7 In this way, the exhibition presented a new kind of social order, with a place for Others and for different kinds of desire. According to this point of view, democracy is applied as it should be: “to guarantee the peace and security of all citizens in a multi-sexual society, and to control aggression and violence”. 8 This project wasn’t, however, shown in a public space. It appeared in the fairly safe space of the Gallery, and proposed a kind of “impossible Paradise” – a Utopian vision within the context of Polish reality. Again, the earlier strategies – to examine democracy, to move the borders of identities which strictly define our social order, to change the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> from a monolithic to a diverse one – are important. Art for Tolerance is important {{in the context of a}} weak Polish democracy. According to Pomian, in a social order, the elimination of differences leads to an atrophy of public life, and is one of the most serious threats facing democracy. 9 It is also a great threat for the arts. In his Dekada (The Decade), Piotr Piotrowski recalled a statement by Josif Brodsky: “The non-reading of poetry leads a society to an appalling level of speech skills that makes it easy prey for demagogues and tyrants”. 9 If applied to contemporary art in Poland – to the existing attempts to block it, to the covert censorship of Art for Tolerance – these words take on a disturbing new meaning. Menas už toleranciją siekia atkreipti visuomenės dėmesį į įvairių mažumų marginalizaciją ir į poreikį priešintis šiai diskriminacijai. Lenkijoje yra vykę įvairių socialinių ir meninių akcijų, tokių kaip Kampanijos prieš homofobiją organizuota akcija Let us see (Leiskite pamatyti) ir Laisvės fondo projektas Tiszert for Freedom (Marškinėliai už laisvę); esama kritinio meno, kuris atkreipia dėmesį į Kito tolerancijos ir panašias problemas. Tokių akcijų ir tokio meno suvokimas ir eksponavimas yra problemiškas – jis net susiduria su tam tikra neinstitucine cenzūra. Žmonės ir grupės, susijusios su dešiniosiomis partijomis ir radikaliuoju katalikų bažnyčios sparnu (pavyzdžiui, Radio Maryja), siekia uždrausti rodyti tokį meną, todėl daug parodų buvo uždaryta ar atšaukta. Šiuolaikinis menas dažnai suvokiamas kaip skandalingas ir „laužantis“ nacionalines ir krikščioniškas vertybes.

Ji skatina apmąstyti Lenkijos demokratijos situaciją. Anot Krzysztofo Pomiano, šiuolaikinis menas ir, beje, ne tik menas, ragina mus suvokti faktą, kad demokratija reikalauja grupių, politikos, idėjų, religijų ir kt. įvairovės, ir kad demokratijai reikia diskusijų...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Imaging Radiometers (SAIR) {{promise to}} be {{powerful}} sensors for high-resolution observations of the Earth at low microwaves frequencies. The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) space mission is an ESA (European Space Agency) led project aimed at global monitoring of surface soil moisture and sea surface salinity from L-band space borne observations. It {{will be the first}} attempt to apply to remote sensing of the Earth surface, the concept of imaging interferometric radiometry by aperture synthesis, initially developed for radio astronomy. Interferometer measurements, also called complex visibilities, are obtained by cross-correlating the signals collected by pairs of spatially separated antennae which have overlapping <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> view. <b>Visibility</b> samples are related to the radiometric brightness temperature of the observed scene by a spatial Fourier-like integral. However, due to the angular extent of the target, the conditions, which typically apply for radio astronomy observations, are no longer valid for Earth remote sensing. As a consequence, the standard imaging algorithms developed by radio astronomers are not convenient for retrieving brightness temperatures of the scene from complex visibilities. The finite physical size of a synthetic antenna results in a truncation <b>of</b> the <b>visibility</b> samples above a certain spatial frequency. The Y-shaped array, filled with equally spaced elements, selected for SMOS leads to complex visibilities sampled over a hexagonal grid inside a star-shaped window in the Fourier domain. The relationship between complex visibility samples and radiometric brightness temperature can thus be rephrased in the Fourier domain: the unknowns are the Fourier components of the scene brightness temperature. Thanks to spatial redundancies, the number of these Fourier components inside the star-shaped window is smaller than the number <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> samples: the over-determined inverse problem has to be solved in the least-squares sense. This contribution extends the concept of "resolvant matrix" to the case of remote sensing of the Earth at low microwaves frequencies. The stability of the reconstruction process is studied in depth, including the influence of the modeling of the instrument on the propagation of errors. To support the theory and to illustrate the performances of this imaging method, in terms of accuracy and computational time, numerical simulations are presented within the frame of the SMOS project...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1970 s, Samoan {{participation}} in American gridiron football has grown exponentially. In American Sāmoa (and other transpacific Samoan communities), football {{has come to}} represent both a real and imagined “way out” of what appears to many as a strangled <b>field</b> <b>of</b> possibility. The <b>visibility</b> and vibrancy <b>of</b> football in American Sāmoa is rooted in Samoan histories of migration to the United States, Samoan cultural sensibilities, the changing market of the American football industry, and narrowing economic opportunities. The transnational nature of football migration is key to understanding the appeal of playing football, the rewards that accrue to successful players, and how these resources have continued to transform conditions of possibility (materially and ideologically) for {{young people in the}} islands. This article explores the layered and complex motivations for football participation as shaped by prospective forms of capital, transnational sporting institutions, and historical contingency. Focused on history, economy, and a transformed vision of the future, it offers a critical genealogy of football in (American) Sāmoa and Samoans in football...|$|R
