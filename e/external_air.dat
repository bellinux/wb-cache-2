5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into <b>external</b> <b>air</b> may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E

2500|$|Compression-ignition engine {{research}} is being undertaken by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, which {{was commissioned by}} DARPA to develop a compression-ignition Wankel engine {{for use in a}} prototype VTOL flying car called the [...] "Transformer".

The engine is claimed to be a 'full-compression, full-expansion, compression-ignition-cycle engine'. An October 28, 2010 patent by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, describes a Wankel engine superficially similar to Rolls-Royce's earlier prototype, that required an <b>external</b> <b>air</b> compressor to achieve high enough compression for compression-ignition-cycle combustion.

2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in <b>external</b> <b>air</b> pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E
