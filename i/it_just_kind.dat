25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of set in.|$|E

Townsend explained that he originally [...] "tried doing the wall-of-sound with it and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of ruined it...it {{turned it into a}} not-so-good Strapping record." [...] The album deliberately eschews the loudness wars, the recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem as loud as possible. [...] "I officially pull my hat out of the loudness wars", Townsend told his mastering engineer. The album's songs were primarily written in open C tuning, except for [...] "A Monday", [...] "Trainfire", and [...] "Disruptr" [...] in open B, [...] "Heaven's End" [...] and [...] "Winter" [...] in open B, and [...] "Quiet Riot" [...] in standard tuning.

500|$|The script {{numbered}} roughly 550 pages when completed, {{about four}} {{times the size of}} an average Hollywood screenplay. It also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes. In preparation for writing it, Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels, as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays. She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear. She immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading. She also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process. Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games, like the Laura Bow series and some of the King's Quest games. She said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne, although it was not purposeful: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of naturally worked out that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Ten {{features}} a two-part track entitled [...] "Master/Slave" [...] that both opens {{and closes the}} album. The first part begins the album, before [...] "Once" [...] starts, {{and the second part}} closes the album, after [...] "Release". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of came about like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E
500|$|With Stankonia, OutKast {{became the}} first hip-hop act to openly {{acknowledge}} rave culture as an influence. [...] During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions. [...] On several tracks on Stankonia, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture {{and the introduction of}} new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip-hop scene. Boston-based DJ Armand Van Helden recalls, [...] "In the nineties, the bpms in hip-hop got slower and the clubs were moody... <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of dragged. I really missed that kind of hands-in-the-air shit." [...] A remix of [...] "B.O.B" [...] created by Rage Against The Machine's Zack de la Rocha received airplay on alternative radio stations, expanding the group's fanbase beyond hip-hop and urban listeners. Despite containing anti-war sentiments, [...] "B.O.B" [...] became popular amongst American troops deployed in Afghanistan. [...] While working on her acclaimed album The ArchAndroid (2010), American R singer Janelle Monáe cited Stankonias experimental nature as an influence. Rapper Pill also acknowledged Stankonia, and particularly the production of Organized Noize, as an inspiration: [...] "The sounds, the instrumentation of the samples, the different horns—everything about the tracks were great to me." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't really talk about anything. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E

500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene.

Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race.
