5|$|Development of {{the film}} began shortly {{after the release of}} Final Destination 2 (2003), though Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the {{franchise}} and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for Final Destination 3. In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster <b>derailment</b> as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. Final Destination 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's <b>derailment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state.

Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E
