500|$|The Ramones {{played before}} an {{audience}} {{for the first time}} on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> performance: [...] "They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song... and it was just this wall of noise... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new." ...|$|E

In a later review for the album's [...] "Platinum Edition" [...] re–release, Allan Clare gave it an 8 out of 10, saying {{the rest of the}} album aside from [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] was [...] "bland". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today felt the album was [...] "something of a mixed bag" [...] and {{described}} the band's sound was [...] "a little too mellow to be rock, and a little too heavy to be pop... their particular style doesn't stray from a middle of the road sound". Breimier described the album was not particularly good or bad, and offered a weak recommendation to fans of worship bands like By the Tree and Delirious?.|$|E
500|$|Science fiction {{historian}} and critic Mike Ashley regards Galaxys success {{as the main}} reason for the subsequent boom in science fiction magazines, commenting that it [...] "revolutionized the field overnight". [...] Under Gold Galaxy provided a market for social science fiction stories that might not have been accepted by Astounding and Fantasy & Science Fiction, the other leading magazines. [...] Pohl regards Galaxy as the place where [...] "the stunning new kinds of science fiction ... flowered, and changed everything in science fiction". [...] In his opinion, Gold's innovation was to ask writers to consider not just new technology, but the subsequent <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> technology on society. [...] He adds, [...] "What Galaxy brought to magazine science fiction was a kind of sophisticated intellectual subtlety. ... After Galaxy it was impossible to go on being naive." [...] Science fiction author Brian Stableford argues that Galaxy quickly usurped Astoundings position as [...] "pioneer of hardcore sf's progress" [...] because it [...] "embraced and gleefully pursued a new series of challenges to moral orthodoxy." [...] Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs, recalled being deeply impressed by the first issue, adding that many fans, including himself, felt that Galaxy became the field's leader almost immediately. [...] In critic John Clute's assessment, Galaxy indeed swiftly supplanted Astounding and remained the leading magazine in the field until Pohl resigned as editor in 1969.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} and varied {{reaction}} to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of [...] "the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of the most important issues of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E

Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Army General Carter F. Ham. It outlined {{a path to}} the implementation of repeal of DADT. The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> person's presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG [...] "echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military .... We hope that our collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over...." [...] The Family Research Council's president, Tony Perkins, interpreted the CRWG data differently, writing that it [...] "reveals that 40 percent of Marines and 25 percent of the Army could leave".|$|E
