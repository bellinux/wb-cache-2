The band focused on quadrilles and schottishes. Later in the decade he joined the fraternal organization the Société des Jeunes Amis, with Philip Nickerson, the son of Professor William Nickerson, and also the Onward Brass Band. He also performed with travelling minstrel shows as early as 1894. In the late 1890s he was performing with P. G. Lowery in the P. T. Wright led Nashville Students.

5000|$|Drum charts are musical charts {{written for}} drummers. They {{are used to}} help guide the drummer through the music. Sometimes they {{are meant to be}} read {{literally}} and other times they are used as suggestions for what the drummer should play. Drum charts include their own musical vocabulary. The music written for drummers is not the same as, say, a pianist. Drummers use their own symbols and language in their charts. For example, a [...] "middle C" [...] note written on a staff for pianists is equivalent to the [...] "snare drum" [...] for drummers. Or, the note [...] "F" [...] on the piano staff is equal to the [...] "bass drum." [...] There is no set standard for writing drum music. But there is a guide that is usually adhered to. For example, in Steve Houghton's book Studio & Big Band <b>Drumming,</b> <b>p.</b> 9, under [...] "Rock Patterns", Steve writes each drum or cymbal used in a percussion staff and states the assigned [...] "note."

40|$|If I {{have seen}} further {{it is by}} {{standing}} {{on the shoulders of}} Giants” Letter from Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, 5 February 1676 The art of brass playing embraces a range of diverse approaches and styles. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the musical melting pot of the USA. On the Shoulders of Giants pays tribute to this diversity and to the great American brass virtuosi whose legacy has provided the foundation for countless brass giants of today. The opening movement, Fanfares, reflects on the legendary Chicago Symphony Orchestra brass section. It has been suggested that the much-admired and distinctive style of the CSO Brass was initially driven by the Germanic repertoire favoured by the early music directors. Here the opening bars from the finale of Bruckner’s 8 th symphony provide the departure point for the musical journey. The work continues (attacca) with an Elegy. America’s role as the birthplace of jazz and two of her leading brass lights are remembered here – Miles Davis (through the sound world created for him by Gil Evans) – and the father of lyrical trombone playing Tommy Dorsey. In acknowledgement that jazz owes its origins to Negro spirituals, the gospel song Steal Away underpins the movement. The finale, a Fantasie Brillante, pays homage to {{the turn of the century}} brass virtuosi of Sousa Band fame. The centrepiece of the movement finds Herbert L. Clarke, Arthur Pryor and Simone Mantia stepping from the mists of time to deliver snippets from their greatest solos (together with passing references to Sousa’s highest <b>pd</b> soloist, <b>drummer</b> August Helmecke). Moments of individual virtuosity lead to a series of brass band power chords - giant footsteps in musical imagery – as present day brass giants conclude this tribute to their predecessors. The world premiere was given by The Cory Band, Music Director Dr Robert Childs, at the Kursaal Ostende, Belgium on May 2 nd 2009...|$|R
