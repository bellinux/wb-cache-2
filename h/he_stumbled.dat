5|$|In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O Levels in Art and English. After {{a job at}} a {{supermarket}} and another for the local council, he started working for his father's firm with a day release at Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to take a welding course. While there, <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> into an art class and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than a week, he returned to Rotherham College, where he subsequently enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.|$|E

25|$|Blackford still {{desired to}} be {{associated}} with the court so he could write the court reports. He was successfully nominated to run for the position of court reporter on the Whig ticket in 1853, but was defeated in the election by future Vice President of the United States Thomas Hendricks. After being defeated in his second election attempt after leaving the court, he briefly returned to private life. He opened a law office and took on one case which he argued before Judge David Wallace. <b>He</b> <b>stumbled</b> in making his arguments as he was unaccustomed to speaking publicly and he lost the case. He found the change of position embarrassing and was occasionally offended by the public and the court system for not showing him what he considered due respect. After the loss of his case he closed his law office.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} eight crewmen {{clung to}} the wreckage throughout the night but by dawn the next morning, Captain Bell and seaman Bill Cunningham had succumbed to hypothermia and died, still afloat nearby in their life-jackets. Through the sea mist Norris spotted a beach several miles off. It was decided that each man should try {{to make his own}} way to shore, and so at intervals of maybe 15 minutes one-by-one the men left the floating planks and struck-out for the beach. Nagle, who didn't have a life-jacket, went first, followed by Thomsen and Fitzsimmons. After about an hour Fizsimmons passed the earlier two, still alive but near exhaustion, and at around 10am <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> onto Woonona beach where he flagged down a Hubbards Bakery truck driven by a Mr Hobbs, who took him to Bulli Police Station where he broke the news of the shipwreck.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{title of this}} pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of the}} passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today is not by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E

25|$|When Moriarty took over, {{he decided}} to start again from scratch. This version of the {{production}} was even more similar to the released game. However, it contained one extra character: a Japanese business tycoon and science-hobbyist named Toshi Olema, who uses his money to buy his way onto the Attila project crew. Toshi would have met a gruesome death when <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> into a cavern with acid dripping from the ceiling, and the other astronauts would {{have been unable to}} safely retrieve his body and bring him back with life crystals. He was later completely removed from the story. This version of the game was also very bloody and adult. Initially, Spielberg thought this feel was very fitting. However, after the release of Jurassic Park in 1993, Spielberg received numerous complaints from parents who had ignored the PG-13 rating and brought their young children to see the movie, only to discover that it contained some sequences of horror, blood, and violence. Thus, worrying that parents would make a similar mistake and purchase The Dig for their kids, Spielberg requested the violence be toned down. Other notable design ideas which were dropped during the game's production include a survival angle, which forced the player to keep water and food supplies for life support, and exploration of entire cities on the planet. Although The Dig was first announced for release in Summer 1992, it ultimately did not launch until December 1995.|$|E
25|$|During one {{of these}} sorties Robert Redhead a sutler had {{captured}} two very important Spanish prisoners; Cosimo d'Alexandrini and Pedro de Lugo a Commissary of the artillery. They had been captured {{not far from the}} North Fort by an English scouting party, Redhead was looking for items to sell to the troops inside when <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> across the Spanish officers checking the strength of the walls. The North Fort was a strong fortress which secured the entrance to Bergen op Zoom from the Scheldt on the north-east side. The two Spanish stayed as guests at the Lieutenant of the garrison's house belonging to William Grimstone and large bribes were offered to allow the Spanish into the North Gate. It was hoped that this would {{fall into the hands of}} Parma thus making the capture of Bergen a lot easier. Willoughby soon discovered this and by his orders pretended to give a ready consent to the proposal. As a ruse Grimstone pretended he was a staunch Catholic and were supporters of William Stanley the English turncoat. They secretly left the camp provided with letters from the two Spaniards to the Duke of Parma informing that everything was prepared for the admittance of the besiegers into the fort. On 6 October they soon met with Parma and were in conference - Parma obliged them to take an oath on the Sacrament that they were acting in good faith. Once this was done he gave them a large gold chain and promised a large sum of money in the event of success.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} written that the {{marriage}} did not end until 1931. In the meantime, Andersen befriended a woman named Nancy.

Joy was not a practiced public speaker, and <b>he</b> <b>stumbled</b> and rushed through his nomination speech, [...] "because we are all now impatient for the voting." [...] Joy ended his speech by nominating [...] "James S. Blaine" [...] for the Republican ticket. Promptly, a number of delegates yelled back, [...] "G! G. Blaine, you fool!"
