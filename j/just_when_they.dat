5|$|In 197879, Harvey’s {{appointments}} increased. Harvey {{stood in}} all of Queensland's five home Shield matches, {{as well as their}} match against the touring Englishmen. He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG. At the end of the season, Harvey was selected for the first of his two Tests. The first, played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic. During the run-chase, the Australians were stunned by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> looked like winning. Sarfraz ended with 9/86the other wicket was run outas Australia collapsed from 3/305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs. Harvey’s partner was Robin Bailhache.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2007, Daimler {{announced}} that they were selling their entire complex of 19 buildings at Potsdamer Platz to SEB Asset Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary of the Swedish banking group SEB. On 28 February 2008, Sony made a similar announcement, of impending sale to a consortium led by American investment banking giant (now bank holding company) Morgan Stanley. Both deals were finalised {{by the end of}} March 2008. Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they may turn out to have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they might have found much harder to sell at a later date, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> needed the cash the most.|$|E
500|$|Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, {{telling him}} that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with ice cream. Lord Royal Highness captures Plankton, and says that [...] "a talking speck" [...] would be a fantastic {{replacement}} for the bubble. SpongeBob and friends go home, but Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are all sad {{because they want to}} stay in Atlantis, even though SpongeBob does not.|$|E

2500|$|... "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the {{eleventh}} season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999. In the episode, inspired by a Zorro movie, Homer begins slapping people with a glove and challenging them to duels. However, when a real Southern gentleman accepts Homer's request for a duel, the Simpsons run off to the old farm Homer lived in with his parents and breed a dangerously addictive but successful tobacco/tomato hybrid called [...] "tomacco". <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are about to gain {{a hundred and fifty}} million dollars from the hybrid, dangerously addicted animals ruin their plan.|$|E
2500|$|String theorist Leonard Susskind {{has argued}} that string theory {{provides}} a natural anthropic explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant. According to Susskind, the different vacuum states of string theory might be realized as different universes within a larger multiverse. The fact that the observed universe has a small cosmological constant is just a tautological consequence {{of the fact that}} a small value is required for life to exist. Many prominent theorists and critics have disagreed with Susskind's conclusions. According to Woit, [...] "in this case [...] is nothing more than an excuse for failure. Speculative scientific ideas fail not <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> make incorrect predictions, but also when they turn out to be vacuous and incapable of predicting anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1952 the 319th FIS began flying {{operational}} missions at Suwon, providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) for B-29 Superfortress missions at night. [...] The 68th {{was relieved}} and reassigned to Japan, but would remain on one-hour alert for possible combat duty over Korea. [...] In June, the first F-94 contacts against enemy jets {{was made and}} the interceptor crews believed {{at the time that}} the communists were testing radar-warning equipment. [...] On several occasions <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were ready to fire on the enemy aircraft, it would start evasive action that indicated the MiGs were equipped with a form of warning radar (as the F-94s were). [...] Other intercepts would take place over North Korea and the F-94 was credited with several air-to-air victories, including the first jet-vs.-jet night victory against a MiG-15. One F-94 was listed as lost due to enemy action, six more to non-enemy causes on combat missions, two were declared as missing on a combat mission and three were lost in accidents. [...] One F-94 was lost when it slowed to [...] during pursuit of a Po-2 biplane.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most direct}} threat to the {{survival}} of the States Army in the months after the lightning advance of the French into the Dutch heartland was a financial one: the three occupied provinces Gelderland, Overijssel, and Utrecht no longer paid the troops that were on their [...] "repartition," [...] which would soon have resulted in the loss of these regiments. Holland therefore agreed to temporarily take over the financing of these troops, on top of the 58% of the costs of the war that it normally already paid. But on the level of the company a different liquidity crisis threatened to ruin the captains. First of all, many [...] "sollicitors-military," [...] afraid they would not be repaid, refused to extend further credit. At the same time the confusion caused by the hasty retreat of the field army behind the Dutch Water Line, combined with the haphazard return of the garrisons of the Dutch fortresses that had so ignominiously capitulated to the French, caused large apparent diminutions of the effective strength of the companies that the captains had to replenish for their own account under the system described above. This threatened to bankrupt many captains, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were needed the most. At the behest of William III the government now stepped in to avert this danger which might have resulted in a breakdown of the army. The States of Holland agreed to compensate the captains for the loss of soldiers at a fixed rate, which enabled the captains to bring their companies up to strength again without courting financial ruin. A soldier killed in action would bring 33 guilders (later increased to 50 guilders); a trooper with his horse 150 guilders. This system was continued {{until the end of the}} Dutch Republic in 1795. Henceforth the government bore the [...] "business risk" [...] of war. In exchange the captains lost their entrepreneurial status and were transformed to professional officers in the modern sense, with all that entailed for tightened discipline. The advantage for the army was that its losses (for instance after battles) were much more rapidly replenished, enabling it to maintain a heightened state of readiness.|$|E
