The quality attributes considered are surface <b>finish,</b> material <b>removal</b> rate and tool flank wear. The Present work applies to optimize the process parameter for turning medium carbon steel bar using HSS tool bit via conventional machining. Optimizing one quality attribute may lead to loss of other quality attribute. Hence in order to simultaneously satisfy all the three quality requirements a multi objective optimization is required. To achieve this exploration of grey relational theory, utility concepts are attempted. To meet the basic assumption of taguchi method that quality attributes should be uncorrelated the study applies PCA based multivariate statistical method and eliminates correlation that exists in between the responses.

These materials are used only for dies so it was chosen so that its industrial usage could be exploited. To comprehend the usage, all the input and output parameters that could affect the machining process, namely input parameters like feed, cutting conditions, speed, etc. and output parameters like surface roughness, surface <b>finish,</b> material <b>removal</b> rate were analyzed using the researches that had already been done on CNC turning. After careful study of a variety of research papers on this topic, it was decided that several input as well as the output parameters would be considered which included feed, depth of cut and cutting speed were taken as the input parameters whereas Material Removal Rate (MRR) and surface finish were taken as the output parameters. From the results of the research papers, it was concluded that feed, depth of cut and cutting speed could be chosen as input parameters whereas MRR and surface finish would be the output parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{start-up}} tests of treating soybean protein wastewater by the integrated two-phase anaerobic reactor were studied. The {{results showed that}} the soybean protein wastewater could be successfully processed around 30 days when running under the situation of dosing seed sludge with the influent of approximately 2000 mg/L and an HRT of 40 h. When the start-up was <b>finished,</b> the <b>removal</b> rate of COD by the reactor was about 80 %. In the zone I, biogas mainly revealed carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen (H 2). Methane was the main component in the zone 2 which ranged from 53 % to 59 % with an average of 55 %. The methane content in biogas increased from the zone I to II. It indicated that the methane-producing capacity of the anaerobic sludge increased. It was found that the uniquely designed two-phase integrated anaerobic reactor {{played a key role in}} treating soybean protein wastewater. The acidogenic fermentation bacteria dominated in the zone I, while methanogen became dominant in the zone II. It realized the relatively effective separation of hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis process in the reactor, which was benefit to promote a more reasonable space distribution of the microbial communities in the reactor. There were some differences between the activities of the sludge in the two reaction zones of the integrated two-phase anaerobic reactor. The activity of protease was higher in the reaction zone I. And the coenzyme F 420 in the reaction zone II was twice than that in the reaction zone I, which indicated that the activity of the methanogens was stronger in the reaction zone II...|$|R
