5000|$|Usually {{the device}} under test (DUT) is {{subjected}} to an AC voltage source. The meter measures the voltage across and the current through the DUT. From the ratio of these the meter can determine {{the magnitude of the}} impedance. The phase angle between the voltage and current is also measured in more advanced instruments; in combination with the impedance, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>capacitance</b> or inductance, and resistance, of the DUT can be calculated and displayed. The meter must assume either a parallel or a series model for these two elements. An ideal capacitor has no characteristics other than capacitance, but there are no physical ideal capacitors. All real capacitors have a little inductance, a little resistance, and some defects causing inefficiency. These can be seen as inductance or resistance in series with the ideal capacitor or in parallel with it. And so likewise with inductors. Even resistors can have inductance (especially if they are wire wound types) and capacitance {{as a consequence of the}} way they are constructed. The most useful assumption, and the one usually adopted, is that LR measurements have the elements in series (as is necessarily the case in an inductor's coil) and that CR measurements have the elements in parallel (as is necessarily the case between a capacitor's 'plates'). Leakage is a special case in capacitors, as the leakage is necessarily across the capacitor plates, that is, in series.|$|E

40|$|Measurement {{errors of}} a {{capacitive}} voltage transformer (CVT) are relevant to its equivalent parameters for which its capacitive divider contributes the most. In daily operation, dielectric aging, moisture, dielectric breakdown, etc., it will exert mixing effects on a capacitive divider’s insulation characteristics, leading to fluctuation in equivalent parameters which result in the measurement error. This paper proposes an equivalent circuit model to represent a CVT which incorporates insulation characteristics of a capacitive divider. After software simulation and laboratory experiments, the relationship between measurement errors and insulation parameters is obtained. It indicates that variation of insulation parameters in a CVT will cause a reasonable measurement error. From field tests and calculation, <b>equivalent</b> <b>capacitance</b> mainly affects magnitude error, while dielectric loss mainly affects phase error. As capacitance changes 0. 2 %, magnitude error can reach − 0. 2 %. As dielectric loss factor changes 0. 2 %, phase error can reach 5 ′. An increase of <b>equivalent</b> <b>capacitance</b> and dielectric loss factor in the high-voltage capacitor will cause a positive real power measurement error.

40|$|The AC {{electrical}} impedance of frog skin {{was measured in}} the range 1 cycle/second to 50 kc/second by injecting current sinusoidally at low current density. The behavior of the skin {{was found to be}} linear so the usual concepts of impedance could be validly employed. In the range 1 cycle/second to 5 kc/second, the impedance traces out a circular arc locus with its center off the real axis; thus the skin could be represented by a series resistance and a parallel combination of a conductance and a phase shift element. The phase shift element has an impedance angle of about 80 °, current leading voltage, with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>capacitance</b> of about 2 μf/cm 2. The phase shift and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>capacitance</b> were independent of the experimental conditions. The parallel conductance, which was responsible for most of the low frequency impedance, could be subdivided into two approximately equal conductances, one associated with sodium ion current and the other associated with chloride ion current. Both currents were determined mainly by the concentrations of the respective ions bathing the outside of the skin. The response to changes in concentration and the response to CO 2 indicated that the chloride current was passive, but the sodium current appeared {{to be associated with the}} active transport mechanism; little sodium could pass through the skin unless associated with active transport...|$|E
