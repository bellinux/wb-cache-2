5|$|<b>Highland</b> cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also <b>Highland</b> cattle in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian <b>Highland</b> Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, <b>Highland</b> cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada.

5|$|The meat of <b>Highland</b> cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. <b>Highland</b> cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture.

5|$|<b>Highland</b> cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their <b>Highland</b> cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black <b>Highland</b> cattle on Churchill Island.

50|$|The {{origin of}} the hemispheric dichotomy, which {{separates}} the northern plains from the southern <b>highlands,</b> has been subject to much debate.

40|$|Questions: What are the {{potential}} drivers of tree line {{change in the}} tropical African <b>highlands?</b> Are the temperature-sensitive tree lines in these <b>highlands</b> shifting {{as a result of}} climate change? Significance: The high-altitude forests provide important ecosystem services for the vulnerable environment of the tropical <b>highlands.</b> Climate change is expected to have pronounced effects on the tree line limit of these forests. Afro-alpine tropical tree lines are therefore potentially valuable as a proxy of climate change and the related response of ecosystems in the tropical <b>highlands.</b> Location: Tropical African <b>highlands.</b> Results: The influence of climatic factors in the African tropical <b>highlands</b> is significantly different compared to other regions. The potentially determining factors for tree line distribution in tropical Africa are temperature, precipitation and cloudiness, carbon balance, fire and anthropo-zoogenic impacts. Despite recent temperature increase, tree lines have not risen to higher altitudes in the tropical African <b>highlands.</b> Instead, high human pressure has caused stabilization and even recession of the tree lines below their natural climatic limit, particularly through livestock herding. But, even neglecting human pressure, there might be a lag in response time between temperature and tree line change. Conclusions: The actual drivers of tree line change in the African tropical <b>highlands</b> are mainly fire and anthropogenic pressure rather than climate change. But long-term drought periods can be a trigger for fire-induced deforestation of the tree line vegetation. Additionally, in volcanic active mountains, volcanic activity is also a potentially limiting factor for the tree line distribution. Tree line dynamics can thus not be used as a proxy of climate change for the African tropical <b>highlands...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{apparent}} that few, if any, craters as old, or highly modified as Imbrian craters {{on the surface of}} the moon are present on the Venusian <b>highlands,</b> or indeed anywhere on the planet's surface. Degraded craters such as those seen on the Moon, Mercury, or Mars are conspicuously absent. Furthermore, virtually all the impact craters on the Venusian surface show modification only by extensional tectonics, whereas the Venusian <b>highlands</b> show modification by compression, strike-slip movement, and finally by extension. Presumably at an earlier time, the surface of Venus resembled the surfaces of the other inner planets. The relatively recent resurfacing event that produced the plains units may be a mechanism for covering the older craters in the plains, but these vast outpourings of lava cannot be invoked as a mechanism for covering the craters on the Venusian <b>highlands.</b> If the plains units had covered the <b>highlands,</b> the entire Venusian surface would appear to be as smooth as the plains units that are embayed by and, therefore, postdate the <b>highlands.</b> The last major tectonic events to affect the <b>highlands</b> such as those seen on Ovda Regio appear to be thrust faulting with consequent folding, followed by at least three episodes of strike-slip faulting and finally extensional faulting. To test whether such tectonic movements could have destroyed <b>highlands</b> crater, a preliminary experiment was conducted by using a Lunar Orbiter mosaic of the lunar uplands as an analog for the ancient Venusian <b>highlands...</b>|$|R
