He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a private foundation that funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E

2500|$|The {{points in}} the complex plane {{representing}} the three roots serve as the vertices of an isosceles triangle. (The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis {{and the other two}} roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) Marden's Theorem says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the foci of the Steiner inellipse of the triangle—the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than [...] then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do <b>its</b> <b>foci</b> and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than , the major axis is vertical and <b>its</b> <b>foci,</b> the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is , the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle's incircle, <b>its</b> <b>foci</b> coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.|$|R
