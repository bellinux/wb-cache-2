5|$|Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens {{can live}} {{for up to}} 30years, and workers live from 1 to 3years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite {{short-lived}} and surviving <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks. Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.|$|E

5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, database interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library. This was sufficiently difficult that it was done <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting perl executable to using just one database interface at a time.|$|E

5000|$|Temple Terrace, Florida is of {{the first}} planned golf-course {{communities}} in the United States, dating from the 1920s. [...] The community was intended <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the very wealthy who would reside there <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{months of the year}} during the winter. For example, the original homes were built without kitchens as it was planned that they would dine at the community clubhouse.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century Varaždin {{developed}} into the industrial centre of Northwestern Croatia. The textile manufacturer Tivar {{was founded in}} 1918. In the Croatian War of Independence, 1991, Varaždin suffered directly <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, because the huge Yugoslav People's Army base quickly surrendered, resulting in a minimal number of casualties, and providing weapons (worth $600m) for the Croatian army.|$|R
5|$|Like {{several other}} luxury neighbourhoods in the city, apartments in the David's Village {{development}} are mostly owned by foreigners who visit <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{days or weeks}} a year. Critics contend that this makes it a ghost town in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|September 4, 2009: Remnants of Hurricane Jimena caused severe {{thunderstorms}} {{to break}} out in eastern San Diego County, California, causing flash floods, and a short blackout that lasted <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

He played <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months with Chelmsford. He was still struggling with alcoholism and delirium tremens and sought out help from Alcoholics Anonymous. He was also hospitalised in the alcoholics' ward of Warley Psychiatric Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth was {{initially}} succeeded by his stepson Lulach, but Lulach ruled <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months before also {{being killed by}} Malcolm III, whose descendants would rule Scotland until the late 13th century. Macbeth is today {{best known as the}} main character of William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth and the many works it has inspired. However, Shakespeare's Macbeth is based on the Holinshed's Chronicles (published in 1577) and is not historically accurate.|$|E

In December 2006, NBC expanded this selection to include every episode of the season. The move to offer every episode was made <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> select shows and represents a marketing push on NBC's part.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} {{flew the}} glider <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{days in the}} early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, probably on October 3, Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes. Most of the kite tests were unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
50|$|The 20th century saw {{lieutenant}} colonel in its present-day status although, during the 1930s, many officers again found the rank to be terminal as {{the rank of}} colonel was reserved <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> select <b>few</b> officers.|$|R

5|$|Tomlinson {{moved to}} the Costa del Sol in Spain for 18 months from early 1996. Realising that a disgruntled former spy could be {{problematic}} for the agency, the aide-de-camp {{to the head of}} MI6 was enlisted to attempt to appease Tomlinson in February 1997. He offered him a £15,000 loan and a marketing job with Jackie Stewart's Formula One racing team, in return for a promise of silence. Tomlinson accepted the offer (he claims under duress) but retained the job <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months before he emigrated to Australia, where his younger brother lived.|$|E
5|$|With the Oilers {{unwilling to}} pay {{what he was}} expecting, Brewer {{decided to go to}} salary {{arbitration}} to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E
50|$|After the {{decrease}} of pelt-saling and fur {{industries in the}} region (and the world) the breed became almost extinct, as it was not popular as a pet or <b>for</b> meat. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> European breeders in Belgium and France are left.|$|R

5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke her up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Belton House {{remained}} relatively untouched during this period, largely {{owing to the}} failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{months of the year}} at Belton, where they came for the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the death duties arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.|$|E
