5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E

Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the High School after Elizabeth Eckford’s experience attempting to enter the school the first time.|$|E

When Arima Harunobu encountered Honda Masazumi during his obligatory visit to Edo, he learned that Honda was unaware of Harunobu's dealings with Okamoto. Furious with Okamoto, Arima presented the case to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu immediately imprisoned Okamoto; further investigation revealed that Arima had various other dealings with Okamoto and {{they were involved in}} a conspiracy to assassinate the Bugyo of Nagasaki. In the end, Okamoto was to sentenced to death by fire, while Arima was stripped of his holdings and exiled to Kai Province.|$|R

25|$|Dana and Kevin {{travel to}} Baltimore to {{investigate}} {{the fate of the}} Weylin plantation after the death of Rufus, but they find very little; a newspaper notice reporting Rufus's death {{as a result of his}} house catching fire, and a Slave Sale announcement listing all the Weylin slaves except Nigel, Carrie, Joe, and Hagar. Dana speculates that Nigel covered up the murder by starting the fire, and feels responsible for the sale of the slaves. To that, Kevin responds that she cannot <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past, and now that Rufus is finally dead, they can return to their peaceful life together.|$|E
500|$|The pit-stop {{decision}} that seemingly cost Lewis Hamilton a {{victory at the}} previous race in Monaco was still a talking point when the paddock arrived in Canada. In Thursday's press conference however, Hamilton insisted that he [...] "couldn't care less" [...] about the incident, saying: [...] "I can't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past so there's honestly no point in thinking about it, it is about trying to shape the future." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1821, Minh Mạng {{sent two}} of his aides from central Vietnam to serve as {{education}} officials in the south. One of the objectives was that they would oversee the imperial examination process and education system, which {{would allow them to}} determine who would serve in the government as mandarins and therefore fill the southern ranks with men acceptable to the court. However, their attempts were either blocked or circumvented by Duyệt's incumbent officials and they returned to the capital two years later in failure. In 1823, one of Duyệt's closest subordinates Tran Nhat Vinh, was indicted by one of Minh Mạng's officials from Huế, who charged him with trading rice on the black market and operating a brothel. Duyệt put a stop to the legal proceedings and angrily tried to turn the tables, calling on the emperor to execute the accusing official. This ended in a stalemate, but a few years later, Vinh was transferred to northern Vietnam and later imprisoned while Duyet was unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter in the south; Vinh's position was taken by one of the emperor's men. In 1826, Duyệt resisted the removal of a regional official by the palace, leading the emperor to criticise him in a proclamation declaring that court appointments came under the purview of Huế. The following year, Duyệt executed convicted criminals without informing the capital, leading the emperor to criticise him again, saying that [...] "the ultimate authority to decide questions of life and death belongs to the court." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Asiatic Cholera Pandemic reached London by 1831 and Gibraltar by 1832. As with yellow fever, it was attributed to [...] "miasma" [...] and its true cause – contaminated water – was unknown. Gibraltar's garrison was far more badly affected than the civilian population, suffering three times the mortality rate. Even so, {{the number of deaths}} was relatively moderate and the British authorities felt little pressure to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation despite further outbreaks of cholera in 1848–49 and 1854.|$|E

[...] She subsequently acknowledged the mistakes made at the time and felt that a debt needed repaying. The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come {{down on the side of}} dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E

2500|$|Learning of {{the unrest}} over the robbery, Smith {{took to the}} streets, {{mingling}} with the residents and merchants, and claiming {{that no one had}} been robbed. Smith argued that Stewart had lost his gold in a square game. Between 2 and 6 PM, “at least a dozen men went to Soapy Smith and {{tried to get him to}} disavow the robbery and give up the men.” Smith, however, maintained his position and “declined to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter,” finally stating in exasperation “that if Stewart had not ‘hollered,’ he [...] would feel like going out and getting him a piece of the money” back. In contrast with the Alaskan, Smith told several businessmen he would make amends.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{residents}} of Charlotte who had experienced much racial discrimination in his lifetime was T.J. Reddy, who was enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. T.J. had been a poet and playwright who used his talents to help him pursue his goal of being an urban activist. He was with his girlfriend Vicky Minar, when he [...] "happened upon a particularly humiliating experience of racial injustice" [...] at the Lazy B Stables. In September 1967, Reddy, his girlfriend, and a group of friends went to Lazy B to enjoy their free time by horseback riding. When the group arrived at the stable, they were rejected from being able to ride since they were black. Since Reddy did not want to make a scene, he decided to leave and not <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> social injustice he just encountered.|$|E
2500|$|Goss {{was noted}} for his piety and {{gentleness}} of character. His pupil, John Stainer, wrote, [...] "That Goss {{was a man}} of religious life was patent to all who came into contact with him, but an appeal to the general effect of his sacred compositions offers public proof of the fact." [...] His mildness was a disadvantage when attempting to deal with his recalcitrant singers. He was unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> laziness of the tenors and basses, who had lifetime security of tenure and were uninterested in learning new music. The biographer Jeremy Dibble writes, [...] "Hostility to [...] fine anthem 'Blessed is the man', composed in 1842, undermined his confidence so markedly that he did not compose any further anthems until 1852, when he was commissioned to write two anthems for the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010, Popović, {{acting as}} the legal {{representative}} of Mila Đinđić and Gordana Đinđić-Filipović, assassinated Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić's mother and sister, respectively, filed a criminal complaint against former Special Operations Unit (JSO) members Milorad Ulemek, Dušan [...] "Gumar" [...] Maričić, Zvezdan Jovanović, Veselin Lečić, Mića Petraković, Dragoslav [...] "Dragan" [...] Krsmanović, and Dragoš Radić, as well as former Yugoslav president Vojislav Koštunica and former Security Administration head Aco Tomić. Popović's criminal complaint accuses the four JSO members of [...] "organizing the November 2001 JSO rebellion against the Serbian government {{in cooperation with the}} late Dušan Spasojević, head of the Zemun Clan". Popović's criminal complaint further accuses then president of FR Yugoslavia, Vojislav Koštunica, of [...] "failing to use the constitutional powers in order to quell the rebellion" [...] while then Military Security Admin head Aco Tomić is accused of [...] "providing the JSO commander with guarantees that the Yugoslav Army (VJ) won't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rebellion". Asked why Đinđić's widow Ružica isn't a party to or signatory of the criminal complaint, Popović said Đinđić's mother and sister contacted him for legal action, while his wife didn't: [...] "I asked my two clients, Đinđić's mother and sister, if I should make the text of the criminal complaint available to his wife to sign, but from their answer I understood there are issues between them that I don't want to go into".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{suspected}} {{ulterior motives}} in the media's reaction, expressing, [...] "It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, {{and it happened}} to me." [...] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, [...] "Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> violence on television, {{where there has been}} much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids." [...] Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, [...] "Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a [...] "sound bite attempt" [...] by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. [...] "When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be [...] "inappropriate" [...] that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. [...] "What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit. The Boston Legal episode [...] "Let Sales Ring" [...] likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, [...] "For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, [...] "It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant [...] "news", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else." ...|$|E

The town also continued to borrow water as use an unused well until another one was opened {{up at the end of}} September. In an interview, the head of the new water conservation in town, Chuck Lacey, said, [...] "We are a small town with small reservoirs and if it doesn't rain for six weeks they dry up. We've been taking a gamble for years with the expansion of the university." [...] Paul Godfrey, head of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst said that, [...] "...the problem has been coming at us for 15 years.

[...] "What I think is, that now we know father is alive, we oughtn't to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} without hearing from him. It stands to reason, don't you think it does, Mr. Hilary, that he would know better than anybody else, what we ought to do.
