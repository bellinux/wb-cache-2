40|$|Background. Waste paper {{recycling}} {{is characterized by}} deterioration {{in the content of}} fiber mass on the <b>fourdrinier</b> <b>wire</b> of a paper-making (cardboard-making) machine, which leads to the fiber content increase in the pit water and to an increase in losses of the source fiber raw material with waste water. Objective. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the influence of amphoteric polymer resins (APR) on the fiber content effectiveness on the <b>fourdrinier</b> <b>wire</b> and the pit water contamination degree. Methods. According to standard techniques, the degree of fiber content and water turbidity, which arises in the paper and cardboard production during the formation on the paper-making machine <b>fourdrinier</b> <b>wire,</b> is determined. Results. The graphs of the dependence of the pit water turbidity on the APR consumption for different milling degree for MS- 5 B- 2 and МС- 8 В- 3 waste paper grades have been constructed. The high efficiency of the APR influence on the fiber content degree on the PPM wire is confirmed. The optimal values of technological parameters (milling degree and APR consumption) for the estimation of the APR impact on the pit water quality have been established. It is shown that the most effective APR among the investigated chemical auxiliaries is UltraRez 200, and the optimum consumption of all APR is 4 kg/ton of paper. The investigated APR are located by the effectiveness increasing of the APR influence on the degree of fiber content and the pit water turbidity reduction in the following series: Luresin KS – Eka WS 325 – Kymene 25 X-Cel – UltraRez 200 – Fennostrengt PA 21. Conclusions. The use of APR allows achieving a high degree of fiber retention on the wire up to 97...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve a {{mechanism}} of expendable bathythermograph measurement by balancing wire resistances between plus <b>wire</b> <b>part</b> and minus <b>wire</b> <b>part</b> and by removing effects of sea water resistance between XBT(Expendable Bathythermograph) and temperature recorder. Methods: The problems are exactly found out through the analysis of XBT and temperature recorder circuit. A process of XBT manufacturing that balances wire resistances between plus <b>wire</b> <b>part</b> and minus <b>wire</b> <b>part</b> is added. Results: The results of this study are as follows; the complicated test process such as temperature accuracy test with a cistern is substituted with a simple process of XBT manufacturing such as balancing wire resistances between plus <b>wire</b> <b>part</b> and minus <b>wire</b> <b>part.</b> Then, the temperature accuracy tolerance of XBT is improved up to ± 0. 1 ℃. Conclusion: Consequently, balancing wire resistances and removing effects of sea water resistance improve temperature accuracy of XBT and reduce expensive and harassing process of XBT manufacturing...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a new problem}} that an on-going TCP flow on a mobile node may experience packet losses of different natures over vertical handover depending on link layer retransmission schemes involved. For example, the packet can be lost due to wireless error over WLAN or due to congestion loss over the <b>wired</b> <b>part.</b> Or packets may be regarded as loss due to reordering which happens over 3 G cellular networks due to its recovery mechanism. To obtain best TCP throughput over vertical handover, we need to accurately identify these three different causes of packet loss, congestion loss, wireless loss, and packet-reordering.|$|R

We assume that the change of BDP over the vertical handover does not happen, or that, at least, the difference of the BDPs has been compensated.
