5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. <b>Ethical</b> <b>questions</b> have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E

To many, this raises <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> akin to those of blood diamonds. Because {{it is difficult to}} distinguish legitimate from illegitimate mining operations, several processors such as Cabot Corp (USA) have decided to forgo central African coltan altogether, relying on other sources.|$|E

25|$|Darin Barney {{has written}} about technology's impact on {{practices}} of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make <b>ethical</b> <b>questions,</b> including {{the question of what}} a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E
25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many {{feel that it is}} not fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|It was the <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> {{that were}} new. Is GH not a wise use of finite {{healthcare}} resources, {{or is the}} physician’s primary responsibility to the patient? If GH is given to most extremely short children to make them taller, will the definition of “extremely short” simply rise, negating the expected social benefit? If GH is given to short children whose parents can afford it, will shortness become a permanent mark of lower social origins? More of these issues are outlined in the ethics section. Whole meetings were devoted to these questions; pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own bioethics issues.|$|E

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Rationale and an example of a systematic review of reasons A systematic review of reasons (or arguments, or reflec-tions on ethical issues; SRR for short) in philosophical bio-ethics [1 - 6] is a new way for decision-makers to obtain comprehensive information about specific ethical topics [7]. In such a review, the goal is not to normatively answer an <b>ethical</b> <b>question</b> (e. g. whether post-trial access to trial drugs is morally required or not) [8]. Its goal is rather to ad-dress the empirical question of which reasons (or argu-ments, or reflections) have been given in the academic literature when considering an <b>ethical</b> <b>question,</b> operation-alized by identifying relevant quotations where reasons are given [7]. This is done in order to present detailed informa-tion on these reasons – whether they are for or against the practice under discussion; to which “type ” of more general reason (e. g. benevolence, avoid exploitation, incentives…) they belong – and thus to provide decision-maker...|$|R
40|$|In a {{world of}} immigration, {{political}} debates are triggered as to which ethical rights a state has to restrict the amount of immigrants it wishes to help. It {{is by no means}} a simple matter of course in regards to making a moral distinction between a right or wrong answer, but rather a grey area in which the <b>ethical</b> <b>question</b> relies. Since human beings are in the centre of focus, the <b>ethical</b> <b>question</b> becomes a given, so the attempt to dissect the subject of immigration in the public debate, calls for a research based on the following terms: Which ethical and moral issues are associated with immigration, and how does the immigrants well-being weigh in on the discussion? In order to answer these questions, the inclusion of various sociologists and philosophers in the research seems to be an ideally approach. We will attempt to draw conclusions based on sociology and different perspectives of ethics in order to gain a clear perception of how the role of the immigrant, being a human being, plays in the ethical perspective...|$|R
25|$|Although fiscal {{responsibility}} {{was a central}} theme of Dozono's campaign, a March 2008 story by The Oregonian noted issues that had been raised about Dozono's business dealings during his 20-year career. The report stated that Dozono had occasionally mixed friendship with business, by accepting loans from personal connections for his travel agency, and raised <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> about Dozono's involvement in several business dealings, one of {{which resulted in a}} lawsuit and an $800,000 settlement. These questions had previously been raised in an investigative report by Nigel Jaquiss in the Willamette Week six years earlier, which also alleged that Dozono had borrowed $1.25 million against the trust fund of a child to companies he controlled, an amount that was subsequently repaid with interest.|$|E
25|$|Rama {{was born}} to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the ruler of the Kingdom of Kosala. His {{siblings}} included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, their life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> and moral dilemmas. Of all their travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell experts {{consider}} {{it unlikely that}} such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use {{on a large scale}} on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also <b>ethical</b> <b>questions</b> surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.|$|E
