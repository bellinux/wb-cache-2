5|$|In 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation {{initiated}} a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its {{goal was to}} renovate and restore the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area {{to the left of}} worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and <b>for</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used <b>for</b> <b>prayer</b> during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used <b>for</b> <b>prayer,</b> equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but the veracity of this claim is disputed.

The building, which was used both as a schoolhouse and <b>for</b> <b>prayer</b> services, was the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|One of London's {{international}} airports, Gatwick Airport, {{was moved}} into the Borough of Crawley in 1974. A year earlier, a multi-faith chaplaincy had been established in the terminal building (now the South Terminal). The chaplaincy is coordinated by the Anglican minister, whose licence was renewed in November 2008. Roman Catholic and Free Church ministers are also on site. When the North Terminal was built, a similar chapel was provided there. Both chapels are open at all times <b>for</b> <b>prayer</b> and meditation, and offer regular services throughout the week.|$|E

5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places <b>for</b> <b>prayer,</b> from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call <b>for</b> <b>prayer</b> in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them <b>for</b> <b>prayer.</b> He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E

25|$|Another synagogue was {{established}} in the 16th century and named after Elijah the Prophet. This synagogue is the oldest of the four. The Eliyahu Ha'navi Synagogue mainly served as a beth midrash for Torah study. Also known as Kahal Talmud Torah, it was only used <b>for</b> <b>prayer</b> on festivals. According to legend, the name of the synagogue was given after an event that took place on Yom Kippur, when one person was missing to complete the minyan required <b>for</b> <b>prayer.</b> Out of the blue, a man, unknown to the worshippers, appeared and the service was able to start. The man mysteriously disappeared after the Neilah prayer. The people were sure that the man was none other than Elijah the Prophet.|$|E
