500|$|The [...] film drew adult audiences {{instead of}} the {{expected}} teens, with viewers rating the film highly. Many filmgoers, after seeing the film once, went right back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> to watch it a second time. Word-of-mouth promotion took the film to the number one position in the United States, and in 10 days it had broken the $10million mark. By November, it was also achieving international fame. Within seven months of release, it had brought in $63 million domestically and boosted attendance in dance classes across America. It {{was one of the}} highest-grossing films of 1987, earning $170million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I {{think at the end of}} the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for the Trylon has been positive. It was voted the best movie {{theater in the}} Minneapolis–Saint Paul area in 2011 and 2012 by City Pages, who wrote in 2011 that [...] "no theater in the Twin Cities can match [...] passion and energy for the movies." [...] In an unranked list of Minneapolis–Saint Paul's best cinemas written for WCCO, Eric Henderson called the Trylon the [...] "pluckiest upstart in the Twin Cities" [...] and described the experience of walking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> as [...] "stepp onto the set of a Michel Gondry fantasy-noir about a scrappy theater thriving {{in the midst of}} a Prohibition-style ban on the moviegoing experience." [...] J. L. Sosa lauded the Trylon on Film School Rejects, praising the concessions selection, the physical intimacy of the space, and the cinema's programmers for their [...] "impeccable taste in both high- and lowbrow culture." ...|$|E

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when we walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E
500|$|As {{the battle}} for Pusan Perimeter wore on, {{logistics}} took an increasingly important toll {{on the outcome of}} individual engagements. UN units faced the challenge of re-equipping the ROK Army and supporting a massive force of troops in a large-scale war that it had not anticipated or planned for. Still, historians have praised US Army logistics planners for the way {{that they were able to}} organize a working logistics system for the UN forces in the battle. Upon the outbreak of the war, the United States had an overwhelming advantage in materiel which had been left behind from World War II, and it relied on this to supply units in the first crucial days while new materiel was produced and shipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> Air superiority was another critical advantage in the favor of the UN. A number of UN contributing nations provided large air forces so that materiel could be transported quickly. At the same time, US Army planners established Pusan port as the main port for supply delivery. The UN also had a great advantage in the port of Pusan itself [...] as it was the most developed port in Korea and as a consequence had the capacity for large numbers of ships to offload supplies. With a large transcontinental navy and strong economic base in Japan, the UN forces were able to utilize the port effectively. These advantages ensured that UN forces had mostly stable lines of supply for the entirety of the battle.|$|E

2500|$|The stage {{adaptation}} was Mailer's second [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> {{behind the}} adaptation of The Deer Park. The play takes its title from an FBI code name for Monroe. According to Mailer, Strawhead represents [...] "(Marilyn's) ironic, whimsical, tortured way of thinking." [...] Mailer sees the fictional Monroe character in the play as [...] "having an immensely dialectical mind; no sooner does she have a thought, than she comes on its opposite. That's the way life presents itself to her - in contrasts and sudden shifts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardians Peter Bradshaw concurred: [...] "Even as a non-believer in {{this kind}} of [...] "sung-through" [...] musical, I was {{battered}} into submission by this mesmeric and sometimes compelling film ...". Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying that the film [...] "is a clutch player that delivers an emotional wallop when it counts. You can walk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> as an agnostic, but you may just leave singing with the choir." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Besides being a feast for the eyes and ears, Les Misérables overflows with humor, heartbreak, rousing action and ravishing romance. Damn the imperfections, it's perfectly marvelous." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Lucas was set {{to provide}} Abrams with advice as a {{creative}} consultant; however, Lucas had no involvement with the film, with his representative stating Lucas [...] "ideally would love not to see any footage until he walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> next December.

Production began in April 2014; it was released on December 18, 2015. In the US, the film is rated PG-13 [...] "for sci-fi action violence", the second Star Wars film to receive that rating after [...] (the five other films received a PG rating).|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{began to}} develop an {{interest}} in acting {{to the point where}} his grades worsened and began to play hookey from school. He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there 'til someone came along, and then ask them to buy my ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E
