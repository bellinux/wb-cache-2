500|$|Around this time, Arthur met {{his future}} wife, Lucille, {{in a shop}} in Alexandria. They married on 24December 1941 and honeymooned in Palestine and Syria. The sudden romance {{came as a shock}} to Arthur's parents; he later recalled, [...] "the first letter <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>was</b> a fair {{imitation}} of panic I think". While on leave, he was also able to make contact with his brother Norman, who was serving as a military policeman in Beirut. Completing his tour with No.3 Squadron, Arthur was repatriated to Australia with his new bride in March 1942. Their ship journeyed to Melbourne via Bombay and Colombo, where it picked up many refugees following the recent fall of Singapore. The couple eventually had four children.|$|E

However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know that you could be attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E

500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>was</b> the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of Hill's {{impressive}} climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge, Fontainebleau, and Buoux. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing [...] "wildly acrobatic climbs" [...] with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried sport climbing in France {{for the first time}} that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia '86, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the Rock Master annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a [...] "disputed ruling" [...] but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was [...] "disorienting" [...] because she did not understand the language, the [...] "format" [...] or the [...] "judging" [...] nor did the organizers of the competition. [...] "There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>was,</b> 'If the women climb without their tops, then we'll pay them the same.'" [...] However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with [...] "other strong women". In one interview, Hill said that [...] "if there wasn't a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic." [...] Destivelle became Hill's main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the pardon—which {{allowed him}} {{to work at the}} Office of War Information, {{creating}} radio programs for broadcast overseas—arrest, incarceration, and attendant notoriety had a devastating effect on Cowell. Conlon Nancarrow, on meeting {{him for the first time}} in 1947, reported, [...] "The impression <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>was</b> that he was a terrified person, with a feeling that 'they're going to get him.'" [...] The experience took a lasting toll on his music: Cowell's compositional output became strikingly more conservative soon after his release from San Quentin, with simpler rhythms and a more traditional harmonic language. Many of his later works are based on American folk music, such as the series of eighteen Hymn and Fuguing Tunes (1943–64); folk music had certainly played a role in a number of Cowell's prewar compositions, but the provocative transformations that had been his signature were now largely abandoned. And, as Nancarrow observed, there were other consequences to Cowell's imprisonment: [...] "Of course, after that, politically, he kept his mouth completely shut. He had been radical politically, too, before." ...|$|E
