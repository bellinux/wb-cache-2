5000|$|Also called [...] "ball slides," [...] {{ball bearing}} slides {{are the most}} common type of linear slide. Ball bearing slides offer smooth {{precision}} motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by ball bearings housed in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. Ball bearing slide applications include delicate instrumentation, robotic assembly, cabinetry, high-end appliances and clean room environments, which primarily serve the manufacturing industry but also the furniture, electronics and construction industries. For example, a widely used ball bearing slide in the furniture industry is a ball bearing <b>drawer</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, RFID {{systems that}} are widely applied for the {{identification}} of objects and people in radio frequency, are {{also going to be}} applied used for localization purposes. In indoor applications (apartments, shopping malls, airports), conventional solutions can use a number of signal parameters: instant of arrival (Time of Arrival, Time Difference of Arrival, TOA, TDOA), angle information (Angle of Arrival, AOA), phase information (Phase Difference of Arrival, PDOA) or the amplitude of the received signal (Received Signal Strength Indicator, RSSI). There are also some scenarios with small dimensions where the location can be extremely useful. For example, in a hospital, a better service could be offered through RFID technology, as it can add more control to prevent human errors. Indeed, RFID technology can be useful for correct patient drug supply, dose recording, accurate dispensing, anti-counterfeiting as well as replenishment ordering; besides, it simplifies the information transfer between doctors and nurses (e. g. allergic reactions or drug treatment). In retail industry, real-time inventory based on RFID allows to monitor actual customer demand for products, to prevent an out-of-stock situation by timely replenishing orders, to increase sales through additional services (e. g. fitting rooms with smart mirrors providing suggestions to the customer). In food and restaurant industry, RFID technology allows for a better food control, as for example avoiding expired products sale. In this framework, RFID-based smart shelves, smart freezers, and proximity point readers have been developed in libraries, hospitals and retail industries. In Chapter I, a brief introduction on RFID systems will be presented, in particular describing the main components involved and the principle of operation. It will be described what is proposed in literature about RFID smart shelf and localization algorithms, with particular attention to the methods exploiting the RSSI information. In Chapter II, an exhaustive experimental study by using off-the-shelf reader, antennas and tags, will be presented with reference to a wooden drawer filled with drug boxes. The LDA algorithm (supervised classifier) will be compared with the K-Means clustering algorithm (unsupervised classifier), to validate the proposed method. The procedure to get several RSSI average samples during the <b>drawer</b> <b>sliding</b> actions is described, and classification performance is investigated. First of all, an RSSI analysis is described with reference to a static configuration of the <b>drawer</b> (not <b>sliding).</b> Then, two classification algorithms are compared by considering a different number of drawer sub-regions. In the second part, the algorithm exploiting the <b>drawer</b> <b>sliding</b> is described and system performance is illustrated to verify the classification capability in a two-region drawer. In Chapter III, a localization technique for smart bookshelves based on UHF-RFID systems is presented. Two off-the-shelf reader antennas attached to the bookshelf columns, one in front of the other, are used as an alternative to large-area thin planar antennas integrated onto the shelf top. Two scenarios were considered: the first one with a shelf that is D = 97 cm long, and the second one with D = 150 cm. Exploiting RSSI data acquired by the two antennas, a clustering algorithm is implemented to classify tagged books within one of the regions the shelf has been subdivided into. Preliminary results of the system performance analysis have been compared with simulations to demonstrate that is possible to create an interference region in different sectors on the shelf, through a proper phase shift between the feed currents of the two antennas. The system requires a power divider, a switch, variable phase shifters and finally a fixed or variable power attenuator based {{on the size of the}} shelf. In Chapter IV the algorithm implemented will be described and then the performance results (in terms of normalized confusion matrix) will be presented and discussed. Finally, a preliminary analysis has been presented considering different tags, even if it is still under developing...|$|R
5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension <b>drawer</b> <b>slides,</b> and <b>drawers</b> and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure.

40|$|Abstract — We explore global {{randomized}} {{joint space}} path planning for articulated robots that {{are subject to}} task space constraints. This paper describes a representation of constrained motion for joint space planners and develops two simple and efficient methods for constrained sampling of joint configurations: Tangent Space Sampling (TS) and First-Order Retraction (FR). Constrained joint space planning is important for many real world problems involving redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in work space coordinates: rotating doors about fixed axes, <b>sliding</b> <b>drawers</b> along fixed trajectories or holding objects level during transport. On the other, joint space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task.

6000|$|... § 4. Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} points of difference between the English and Continental nations is in the degree of finish given to their ordinary work. It is enough to cross from Dover to Calais to feel this difference; and to travel farther only increases the sense of it. English windows for the most part fit their sashes, and their woodwork is neatly planed and smoothed; French windows are larger, heavier, and framed with wood that looks as if it had been cut to its shape with a hatchet; they have curious and cumbrous fastenings, and can only be forced asunder or together by some ingenuity and effort, and even then not properly. So with everything else--French, Italian, and German, and, as far as I know, Continental. Foreign <b>drawers</b> do not <b>slide</b> as well as ours: foreign knives do not cut so well; foreign wheels do not turn so well, and we commonly plume ourselves much upon this, believing that generally the English people do their work better and more thoroughly, or as they say, [...] "turn it out of their hands in better style," [...] than foreigners. I do not know how far this is really the case. There may be a flimsy neatness, as well as a substantial roughness; it does not necessarily follow that the window which shuts easiest will last the longest, or that the harness which glitters the most is assuredly made of the toughest leather. I am afraid, that if this peculiar character of finish in our workmanship ever arose from a greater heartiness and thoroughness in our ways of doing things, it does so only now in the case of our best manufacturers; and that a great deal of the work done in England, however good in appearance, is but treacherous and rotten in substance. Still, I think that there is really in the English mind, for the most part, a stronger desire to do things as well as they can be done, and less inclination to put up with inferiorities or insufficiencies, than in general characterise the temper of foreigners. There is in this conclusion no ground for national vanity; for though the desire to do things as well as they can be done at first appears like a virtue, it is certainly not so in all its forms. On the contrary, it proceeds in nine cases out of ten more from vanity than conscientiousness; and that, moreover, often a weak vanity. I suppose that as much finish is displayed in the fittings of the private carriages of our young rich men as in any other department of English manufacture; and that our St. James's Street cabs, dogcarts, and liveries are singularly perfect in their way. But the feeling with which this perfection is insisted upon (however desirable as a sign of energy of purpose) is not in itself a peculiarly amiable or noble feeling; neither is it an ignoble disposition which would induce a country gentleman to put up with certain deficiencies in the appearance of his country-made carriage. It is true that such philosophy may degenerate into negligence, and that much thought and long discussion would be needed before we could determine satisfactorily the limiting lines between virtuous contentment and faultful carelessness; but at all events we have no right at once to pronounce ourselves the wisest people because we like to do all things in the best way. There are many little things which to do admirably is to waste both time and cost; and the real question is not so much whether we have done a given thing as well as possible, as whether we have turned a given quantity of labor to the best account.|$|R
