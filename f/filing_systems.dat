25|$|Use of {{hardware}} RAID cards, {{perhaps in the}} mistaken belief that these will 'help' ZFS. While routine for other <b>filing</b> <b>systems,</b> ZFS handles RAID natively, and is designed {{to work with a}} raw and unmodified low level view of storage devices, so it can fully use its functionality. A separate RAID card may leave ZFS less efficient and reliable. For example ZFS checksums all data, but most RAID cards will not do this as effectively, or for cached data. Separate cards can also mislead ZFS about the state of data, for example after a crash, or by mis-signalling exactly when data has safely been written, and in some cases this can lead to issues and data loss. Separate cards can also slow down the system, sometimes greatly, by adding latency to every data read/write operation, or by undertaking full rebuilds of damaged arrays where ZFS would have only needed to do minor repairs of a few seconds.|$|E

40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and files. In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of files in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> 14. 1 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> <b>system</b> type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> typically, the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework was developed to allow Sun’s distributed computing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> are examples. Network <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that present various abstractions as files in a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> <b>system</b> represents the address space of a process as a series of files. 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> <b>system</b> independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual file, or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> <b>system</b> management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> <b>system</b> by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

Some examples include: MapR <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (MapR-FS), Ceph-FS, Fraunhofer <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (BeeGFS), Lustre <b>File</b> <b>System,</b> IBM General Parallel <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (GPFS), and Parallel Virtual <b>File</b> <b>System.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Before computerization, manual <b>filing</b> <b>systems</b> {{were used}} in large {{fingerprint}} repositories. Manual classification systems {{were based on the}} general ridge patterns of several or all fingers (such as {{the presence or absence of}} circular patterns). This allowed the filing and retrieval of paper records in large collections based on friction ridge patterns alone. [...] The most popular systems used the pattern class of each finger to form a key (a number) to assist lookup in a filing system. [...] Classification systems include the Roscher system, the Juan Vucetich system, and the Henry Classification System. [...] The Roscher system was developed in Germany and implemented in both Germany and Japan, the Vucetich system (developed by a Croatian-born Buenos Aires Police Officer) was developed in Argentina and implemented throughout South America, and the Henry system was developed in India and implemented in most English-speaking countries.|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of Storage Networking, distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that allow data sharing through shared disks will become vital. We refer to Cluster <b>File</b> <b>Systems</b> as a distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> optimized for environments of clustered servers. The requirements such <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> is that they guarantee <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> consistency while allowing shared access from multiple nodes in a shared-disk environment. In this paper we evaluate three approaches for designing a cluster <b>file</b> <b>system</b> - conventional client/server distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> symmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> and asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> These alternatives are considered by using our prototype cluster <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> HAMFS (Highly Available Multi-server <b>File</b> <b>System).</b> HAMFS is classified as an asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> Its technologies are incorporated into our commercial cluster <b>file</b> <b>system</b> product named SafeFILE. SafeFILE offers a disk pooling facility that supports off-the-shelf disks, and balances file load across these disks automatically and dynamically. From our measurements, we identify the required disk capabilities, such as multi-node tag queuing. We also identify the advantages of an asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>system</b> over other alternatives...|$|R

40|$|We propose and {{evaluate}} an approach for decoupling persistent-cache management from general <b>file</b> <b>system</b> design. Several distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> maintain a persistent cache {{of data to}} speed up accesses. Most of these <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> retain complete control over various aspects of cache management, such as granularity of caching, and policies for cache placement and eviction. Hardcoding cache management into the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> often results in sub-optimal performance as the clients of the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are prevented from exploiting information about their workload in order to tune cache management. We introduce xCachefs, a framework that allows clients to transparently augment the cache management of the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> and customize the caching policy based on their resources and workload. xCachefs {{can be used to}} cache data persistently from any slow <b>file</b> <b>system</b> to a faster <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> It mounts over two underlying <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> which can be local disk <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> like Ext 2 or remote <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> like NFS. xCachefs maintains the same directory structure as in the source <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> so that disconnected reads are possible when the source <b>file</b> <b>system</b> is down. ...|$|R
40|$|In this note, we {{introduce}} a simple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> implementation, known as vsfs (the Very Simple <b>File</b> <b>System).</b> This <b>file</b> <b>system</b> is a simplified {{version of a}} typical UNIX <b>file</b> <b>system</b> and thus serves to introduce {{some of the basic}} on-disk structures, access methods, and policies that you will find in many <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> today. The <b>file</b> <b>system</b> is pure software; unlike our development of CPU and memory virtualization, we will not be adding hardware features to make some aspect of the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> work better (though we will want to pay attention to device characteristics to make sure the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> works well).
