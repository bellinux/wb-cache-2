He first met her while volunteering at the hospital in which her grandfather was working.

He had been waiting for her to find him.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> all the Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen {{years after her}} death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

His sewer system operates into the 21st century, servicing a city that has grown to a population of over eight million. The historian Peter Ackroyd argues that Bazalgette should be considered a hero of London.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers.

Since the war it has formed the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth of coverage and accuracy have <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if {{they accepted}} bribes and rescinding legislation when {{a conflict of}} interest was suspected. He <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of the}} government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism. This, {{combined with the}} ready availability of wood as a building material, <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> relatively few examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E

The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 Congress {{passed a}} law that gave several states {{wetlands}} within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> the state {{would be responsible for}} funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E

5|$|Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had {{excellent}} and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed {{for this purpose}} and thus worked to a common standard of training.
