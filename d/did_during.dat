5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he <b>did</b> <b>during</b> the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|The vice {{activities}} {{on the island and}} in the county were not unique in Texas. San Antonio had perhaps the second most infamous red-light district in the early 20th century and most major cities in the state had significant vice activities at least until mid-century, though most went into decline before Galveston's <b>did.</b> <b>During</b> the Open Era Galveston's vice industries dominated, while most other areas of the state were at times forced to crack down on vice due to public pressure.|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it <b>did</b> <b>during</b> the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|The SUPP {{attacked}} the DAP {{on the basis}} of its coalition with the Islamist PAS, arguing that “A vote for Rocket is a vote for Islamic State". Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary leader of the DAP, said that the issue was a “killer weapon” which could “finish off” the chances of DAP's candidate winning by frightening off the Chinese and non-Muslim voters in Sibu as it <b>did</b> <b>during</b> the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both Karpal Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats. The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to be voted in kampua noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard; a reference to PAS's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state.|$|E

The division and brigade served in the eastern region of the country, {{along the border with}} Pakistan, fulfilling a similar role as it <b>did</b> <b>during</b> its previous deployment. During this time, the deployment of the brigade was extended along with that of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, however, it was eventually replaced by the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team which was rerouted from Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The lineage {{and honors}} of the 20th Engineer Brigade {{date back to}} the American Civil War. First {{designated}} as the Battalion of Engineers on 3 August 1861, the battalion participated in 10 campaigns during the Civil War. Since that time, unit designations have changed many times as predecessors of the 20th Engineer Brigade have served in the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War, the Mexican Expedition, World War I and World War II. Though it was not officially designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade during all of these wars, the Brigade received campaign participation credit for all of these campaigns, and has numerous campaign streamers for what its previous incarnations <b>did</b> <b>during</b> these conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The team's reserve wicket-keeper, Saggers {{played in}} only the Fourth of five Tests, {{due to an}} injury to first-choice gloveman Don Tallon. The match was Saggers's Test debut and he scored five in his only innings with the bat and took three catches. Despite being the second-choice gloveman, Saggers conceded byes at a lower rate than Tallon <b>did</b> <b>during</b> the English summer. During the Fourth Test, Saggers conceded only six byes as England amassed a match total of 861, the lowest {{percentage}} of byes conceded by Australia in a match during the tour. Despite this, Tallon remained the favoured gloveman, as Bradman deemed him to be faster and more athletic.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no record}} of Molotov {{attempting}} to moderate {{the course of the}} purges or even to save individuals, as some other Soviet officials <b>did.</b> <b>During</b> the Great Purge, he approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin. Molotov was one of few with whom Stalin openly discussed the purges. Although Molotov and Stalin signed a public decree in 1938 that disassociated them from the ongoing Great Purge, in private, and even after Stalin's death, Molotov supported the Great Purge and the executions carried out by his government.|$|E

5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never <b>did</b> <b>during</b> her childhood.|$|E
5|$|Peru had {{armed forces}} nearly {{four times the}} {{strength}} of those of San Martín: 6,244 soldiers in Lima, 8,000 at the northern provinces, 1,263 in the coast, 1,380 in Arequipa and 6,000 in the Upper Peru; nearly 23,000 soldiers in total. The Army of the Andes had 4,000 soldiers instead, and Cochrane's navy another 1,600. With this disparity of forces, San Martín tried to avoid battles. He tried instead to divide the enemy forces in several locations, as he <b>did</b> <b>during</b> the Crossing of the Andes, and trap the royalists with a pincer movement with either reinforcements of the Army of the North from the South or the army of Simón Bolívar from the North. He also tried to promote rebellions and insurrection within the royalist ranks, and promised the emancipation of any slaves that deserted their Peruvian masters and join the army of San Martín. The spreading of {{the news of the}} Liberal Triennium, a liberal rebellion in Spain that reinstated the Spanish Constitution of 1812, also sought to undermine royalist loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Standing at 6 feet 4 {{inches tall}} (1.93 m) and {{weighing}} 220 pounds (100kg), Wade is a shooting guard {{that is also}} capable of playing point guard as he <b>did</b> <b>during</b> his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups. On offense, he has established himself {{as one of the}} quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well {{as one of the best}} slashers in the NBA. Wade's signature one-two step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot. Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently; he ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA. He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.|$|E

5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai <b>did.</b> <b>During</b> the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E
