25|$|A {{familiar}} and widely used {{example is the}} inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to a destructive level due to the negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> of the tube's voltage-current characteristic.|$|E
25|$|These {{are similar}} to tunnel diodes {{in that they are}} made of {{materials}} such as GaAs or InP that exhibit a region of negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance.</b> With appropriate biasing, dipole domains form and travel across the diode, allowing high frequency microwave oscillators to be built.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{negative}} <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> devices, so as more current flows through them, the electrical {{resistance of the}} fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more current to flow. Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled current flow. To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate the current flow through the lamp.|$|E

2500|$|An {{avalanche}} transistor is a {{bipolar junction transistor}} designed for operation {{in the region of}} its collector-current/collector-to-emitter voltage characteristics beyond the collector-to-emitter breakdown voltage, called avalanche breakdown region. [...] This region is characterized by avalanche breakdown, which is a phenomenon similar to Townsend discharge for gases, and negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance.</b> Operation in the avalanche breakdown region is called avalanche-mode operation: it gives {{avalanche transistor}}s the ability to switch very high currents with less than a nanosecond rise and fall times (transition times). Transistors not specifically designed for the purpose can have reasonably consistent avalanche properties; for example 82% of samples of the 15V high-speed switch 2N2369, manufactured over a 12-year period, were capable of generating avalanche breakdown pulses with rise time of 350ps or less, using a 90V power supply as Jim Williams writes.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{electronic}} devices operate under effect of quantum tunneling. It even {{exists in the}} simple light switch. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as resonant tunneling diode. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by resonant tunneling through two or more potential barriers (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to Fermi level, tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum [...] mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such {{electronic devices}}.|$|E

5000|$|Negative {{resistance}} is an uncommon property which {{occurs in a}} few nonlinear electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current , and <b>differential</b> <b>resistance,</b> the ratio {{of a change in}} voltage to the resulting change in current [...] The term negative resistance means negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> (NDR), [...] In general, a negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> is a two-terminal component which can amplify, converting DC power applied to its terminals to AC output power to amplify an AC signal applied to the same terminals. They are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers, particularly at microwave frequencies. Most microwave energy is produced with negative <b>differential</b> <b>resistance</b> devices. They can also have hysteresis and be bistable, and so are used in switching and memory circuits.
