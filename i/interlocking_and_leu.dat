40|$|Six leucine auxotrophic {{strains of}} the white rot {{basidiomycete}} Phanerochaete chrysosporium were characterized genetically and biochemically. Complementation studies involving the use of heterokaryons identified three leucine complementation groups. Since all of the leucine auxotrophs grew on minimal medium supplemented with α-ketoisocaproate {{as well as with}} leucine, the transaminase catalyzing the last step in the leucine pathway was apparently normal in all strains. Therefore, the wild-type, auxotrophic, and several heterokaryotic strains were assayed for the activities of the other enzymes specific to leucine biosynthesis. <b>Leu</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 4 strains (complementation group I) lacked only α-isopropylmalate synthase activity; <b>Leu</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 6 strains (group III) lacked isopropylmalate isomerase activity; <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 5 strains (group II) lacked β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.

The <b>interlock</b> <b>and</b> control system is responsible for ensunng that nobody enters the treatment vault during an irradiation, the extraction of the beamstop devices 'from the beam-line to allow the irradiation of {{the patient and the}} insertion of those beam-stop devices when an error condition is detected.

40|$|The {{unambiguous}} stereospecific {{assignment of}} the prochiral methyl groups in Val <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> {{plays an important}} role in the structural investigation of proteins by NMR. Here, we present a straightforward method for their stereospecific solid-state NMR assignment based on [2 - 13 C]Glucose ([2 - 13 C]Glc) as the sole carbon source during protein expression. The approach is fundamentally based on the stereo-selective biosynthetic pathway of Val <b>and</b> <b>Leu,</b> <b>and</b> the co-presence of [2 - 13 C]pyruvate produced mainly by glycolysis and [3 - 13 C]/[1, 3 - 13 C]pyruvate most probably formed through scrambling in the pentose phosphate pathway.

40|$|Improving {{the amino}} acid (AA) {{profile of the}} diet by using l-Lys, l-Thr, dl-Met, l-Trp and l-Val helps to reduce the dietary CP content, thereby {{reducing}} nitrogen excretion while maintaining the performance of pigs. Valine is the fifth limiting AA in cereal–soybean meal-based diets. The {{extent to which the}} CP content in the diet can be reduced further without compromising performance depends on the requirement of the next limiting AA. In cereal–soybean meal-based diets, Ile, His <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> may be the limiting AAs after Val, although information on the requirements for these AAs is scarce. Six experiments were conducted to determine the effect of supplementing a low-CP diet with l-Ile, l-His and l-Leu on the performance of pigs weighing 10 to 20 kg. Experiment 1 was designed to determine the most limiting AA with respect to performance among Ile, His <b>and</b> <b>Leu.</b> A diet 10 % deficient in Ile, <b>Leu</b> <b>and</b> His relative to the National Research Council (NRC, 1998) requirement estimates tended to decrease daily feed intake and daily gain by 6 % and 8 %, respectively. A 10 % deficiency in His alone had no effect, whereas a 10 % deficiency in Ile or Leu slightly reduced daily feed intake and gain. In the remaining experiments, the standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ile : Lys, His : Lys <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> : Lys requirements were estimated. In Experiments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, 14 blocks of six pigs each were assigned to six levels of SID Ile : Lys (40 %, 43 %, 46 %, 49 %, 52 % and 55 %), His : Lys (20 %, 24 %, 28 %, 32 %, 36 % and 40 %), His : Lys (21 %, 24 %, 27 %, 30 %, 33 % <b>and</b> 36 %), <b>Leu</b> : Lys (70 %, 78 %, 86 %, 94 %, 102 % and 110 %) <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> : Lys (80 %, 90 %, 100 %, 110 %, 120 % and 130 %), respectively. Across experiments, the estimated SID Ile : Lys, His : Lys <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> : Lys requirements for maximizing daily gain were 49 %, 32 % and 102 %, respectively, using a curvilinear plateau model. When Ile, His <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> levels were 10 % below the requirement estimate, daily gain was reduced by 9 %, 3 % and 3 %, respectively.

40|$|We {{examine how}} alliances}formal, {{contractual}} interorganizational relations}co-evolve with emergent, informal interorganizational relations. To form alliances, firms must acquire information on potential partners, and {{the acquisition of}} this intelligence occurs through both formal and informal channels. Here we evaluate the effects of two of these informal channels: joint participation in cooperative technical organizations (CTOs) <b>and</b> director <b>interlocks.</b> Since director interlocks connect firms through the highest managerial levels while joint CTO participation connects firms through mid-level technical personnel, we examine whether each type of informal tie contributes to alliance formation as well as whether ties at multiple levels serve as complements or substitutes for this purpose. We also examine whether all types of ties}alliances, <b>interlocks</b> <b>and</b> CTO participation}co-evolve endogenously or whether there are more direct causal relationships between and among these various types of networks. We find that both <b>interlocks</b> <b>and</b> CTO participation facilitate alliance formation, yet interlocks only facilitate alliance formation when the common director serves as an officer {{in one of the}} firms. An additional distinction between the role of <b>interlocks</b> <b>and</b> CTO participation is that the relationship between <b>interlocks</b> <b>and</b> alliance formation appears endogenous, in contrast to CTO participation, which causally precedes alliance formation.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{we showed}} that the amino acid at {{position}} 61 in TM 1 of human P-glycoprotein is important in deciding the substrate specificity of this protein. In this work, we investigated whether the amino acids other than His 61 in TM 1 of P-glycoprotein are also essential in the function of this protein. Nine amino acids residues, from Ala 57 to Leu 65 in TM 1, were independently substituted to Arg, and analyzed the drug resistance of cells stably expressing each of these mutant P-glycoproteins. The mutant P-glycoproteins Ile 60 →Arg, His 61 →Arg, Ala 63 →Arg, Gly 64 →Arg, <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 →Arg were normally processed and expressed in the plasma membrane. Substrate specificities of mutant P-glycoproteins Gly 64 →Arg <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 →Arg were quite {{different from that of}} the wild type, and similar to that of the His 61 →Arg mutant, while the Ile 60 →Arg and Ala 63 →Arg mutant P-glycoproteins showed similar substrate specificities to that of the wild-type P-glycoprotein, suggesting that not only the amino acid residue at position 61 but also those at position 64 and 65 are also important in deciding the substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein. These three amino acids His 61, Gly 64, <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 would form a compact region on an α-helix arrangement of TM 1. These results suggest that a region consisting of His 61, Gly 64, <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 in TM 1 would participate in the formation of the recognition site for substrates of P-glycoprotein...|$|R
