40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} the first CLEAR {{evaluation}} on CLassification of Events, Activities and Relationships- which took place in early 2006 and concluded with a two day evaluation workshop in April 2006. CLEAR is an international effort to evaluate systems for the multimodal perception of people, their activities and interactions. It provides a new international evaluation framework for such technologies. It aims to support the definition of common evaluation tasks and metrics, to coordinate and leverage the production of necessary multimodal corpora and to provide a possibility for comparing different algorithms and approaches on common benchmarks, which will result in faster progress in the research community. This paper describes the evaluation tasks, including metrics and databases used, that were conducted in CLEAR 2006, and provides an overview of the results. The evaluation tasks in CLEAR 2006 included person tracking, face detection and tracking, person <b>identification,</b> <b>head</b> pose estimation, vehicle tracking as well as acoustic scene analysis. Overall, more than 20 subtasks were conducted, which included acoustic, visual and audio-visual analysis for many of the main tasks, as well as different data domains and evaluation conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConverting a treebank into a CCGbank {{opens the}} {{respective}} language to the sophisticated tools developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and enriches cross-linguistic development. The conversion {{is primarily a}} three-step process: determining constituents’ types, binarization, and category conversion. Usually, this process involves a preprocessing step to the Treebank of choice for correcting brackets and normalizing tags for any changes that were introduced during the manual annotation, as well as extracting morpho-syntactic information that is necessary for determining constituents’ types. In this article, we describe the required preprocessing step on the Arabic Treebank, {{as well as how}} to determine Arabic constituents’ types. We conducted an experiment on parts 1 and 2 of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) aimed at converting the PATB into an Arabic CCGbank.

For that purpose, several investment strategies conditioned by the <b>identification</b> of the <b>Head</b> and Shoulders pattern (in its basic and inverted forms) by a computer algorithm in daily price series of 30 stocks from January 1994 to January 2009 were defined. Confidence intervals consistent with the null hypothesis that no strategies with positive returns can be based only on historical data were constructed using the Bootstrap sample inference technique {{in order to test}} the predictive power of each strategy. More specifically, the mean returns obtained by each strategy when applied to the stock’s price series were compared to those obtained by the same strategies when applied to 1. 000 artificial price series - for each stock - generated in a parametric manner, by an E-GARCH, and in a nonparametric one. Overall, our results show {{that it is possible to}} create strategies conditioned by the occurrence of Head and Shoulders, with positive returns, which indicates that these patterns can capture from stock historical prices some signals about their future price trend that makes possible to create profitable strategies. Nevertheless, the same conclusions are not valid for the pattern in its inverted form and when the effects of taxes and transaction costs are considered, depending on their magnitude, neither in its basic form. ...|$|R

This requires {{the assumption of}} a precise and realistic volume conductor model of the specific subject's head, i. e., a 3 -D representation of the head's electrical properties in terms of shape and electrical conductivities. Source reconstruction accuracy is influenced by errors committed in head modeling.

An approach utilised in other solid cancers is the identification and enumeration of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of patients. Low numbers of CTCs has been a limiting factor in the HNC field to date. Here we present a methodology to expand HNC patient derived CTCs ex-vivo. As a proof of principle study, 25 advanced stage HNC patient bloods were enriched for circulating tumour cells through negative selection and cultured in 2 D and 3 D culture environments under hypoxic conditions (2 % O 2, 5 % CO 2). CTCs were detected in 14 / 25 (56 %) of patients (ranging from 1 – 15 CTCs/ 5 mL blood). Short term CTC cultures were successfully generated in 7 / 25 advanced stage HNC patients (5 / 7 of these cultures were from HPV+ patients). Blood samples from which CTC culture was successful had higher CTC counts (p = 0. 0002), and were predominantly from HPV+ patients (p = 0. 007). This is, to our knowledge, the first pilot study to culture HNC CTCs ex-vivo.

From these samples significant interspecific and intraspecific variations in head fan ray number were found both spatially and temporally within Algonquin Park. From these data it is concluded that head fan ray number for the species analysed is a developmentally plastic character, which varies in response to food availability. Furthermore, given the extreme variations in head fan ray number found in some species, I recommend that head fan ray number not be used as an aid to identification unless it can be shown to be a fixed character for the species in question...|$|R
