5|$|In 1966 Libby {{divorced}} Leonor {{and married}} Leona Woods Marshall, a distinguished nuclear physicist {{who was one}} of the original builders of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. She joined him at UCLA as a professor of <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> in 1973. Through this second marriage he acquired two stepsons, the children of her first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first <b>Environmental</b> <b>Engineering</b> program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E

Five half-day, classroom-style sessions were led by recognized experts {{in the application of}} seismic, electrical, gravity, magnetics, and ground-penetrating radar methods. Classroom sessions were intended to educate regulators, environmental program managers, consultants, and students who are new to near-surface geophysics or are interested in learning how to incorporate appropriate geophysical approaches into characterization or remediation programs or evaluate the suitability of geophysical methods for general classes of <b>environmental</b> or <b>engineering</b> problems...|$|R
