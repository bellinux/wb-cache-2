Survivability for humans immersed at sea is verydependent on the time spent in the water, and varies significantly with sea temperature; thismakes it imperative that the victim is retrieved rapidly. Our current research is aimed atreducing this time using several UAV's searching the ships wake simultaneously, as a swarm. Since the wake is chaotic, a simulation was developed to model different random motions of avictim based on a chaotic equation.

By <b>expanding</b> <b>squares,</b> we prove several Hardy inequalities {{with two}} {{critical}} singularities and constants which explicitly {{depend upon the}} distance between the two singularities. These inequalities involve the L 2 norm. Such results are generalized to an arbitrary number of singularities and compared with standard results given by the IMS method. The generalized version of Hardy inequalities with several singularities is equivalent to some spectral information on a Schrödinger operator involving a potential with several inverse square singularities. We also give a generalized Hardy inequality for Dirac operators {{in the case of a}} potential having several singularities of Coulomb type, which are critical for Dirac operators...|$|R

40|$|Flies {{rely heavily}} on visual {{feedback}} for several aspects of flight control. As a fly approaches an object, the image projected across its retina expands, providing the fly with visual feedback {{that can be used}} either to trigger a collision-avoidance maneuver or a landing response. To determine how a fly makes the decision to land on or avoid a looming object, we measured the behaviors generated in response to an expanding image during tethered flight in a visual closed-loop flight arena. During these experiments, each fly varied its wing-stroke kinematics to actively control the azimuth position of a 15 °× 15 ° square within its visual field. Periodically, the <b>square</b> symmetrically <b>expanded</b> in both the horizontal and vertical directions. We measured changes in the fly's wing-stroke amplitude and frequency in response to the <b>expanding</b> <b>square</b> while optically tracking the position of its legs to monitor stereotyped landing responses. Although this stimulus could elicit both the landing responses and collision-avoidance reactions, separate pathways appear to mediate the two behaviors. For example, if the square is in the lateral portion of the fly's field of view at the onset of expansion, the fly increases stroke amplitude in one wing while decreasing amplitude in the other, indicative of a collision-avoidance maneuver. In contrast, frontal expansion elicits an increase in wing-beat frequency and leg extension, indicative of a landing response. To further characterize the sensitivity of these responses to expansion rate, we tested a range of expansion velocities from 100 to 10000 ° s^(- 1). Differences in the latency of both the collision-avoidance reactions and the landing responses with expansion rate supported the hypothesis that the two behaviors are mediated by separate pathways. To examine the effects of visual feedback on the magnitude and time course of the two behaviors, we presented the stimulus under open-loop conditions, such that the fly's response did not alter the position of the <b>expanding</b> <b>square.</b> From our results we suggest a model that takes into account the spatial sensitivities and temporal latencies of the collision-avoidance and landing responses, and is sufficient to schematically represent how the fly uses integration of motion information in deciding whether to turn or land when confronted with an expanding object...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} advancements of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) is their ability to carry {{different}} sensors and to surveil areas {{over long periods of}} time. Depending on the types of sensors applied, different automated flight maneuvers need to be planned and executed to acquire imagery that is meeting the missions’ objectives. These flight maneuvers are generally based on common military scan patterns (e. g. Creeping Line, <b>Expanding</b> <b>Square)</b> and are chosen with regard to their respective advantages based on the mission characteristics. The calculation of these scan patterns requires a high accuracy and efficiency to provide optimal results and to maintain safety. In this paper the results of flight experiments with an RPAS (i. e. research aircraft demonstrating capabilities of an RPAS) in non-segregated airspace are shown. In these experiments flight paths for different scan patterns were calculated and validated in terms of accuracy, efficiency and safety. In addition, different strategies for dynamically adapting the calculated flight path based on results from a real-time image analysis are described and evaluated...|$|R
