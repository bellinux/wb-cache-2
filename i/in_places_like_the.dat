50|$|The V-Cube 5 mechanism, {{designed}} by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements {{in common with}} both. The corners reach {{to the center of}} <b>the</b> puzzle (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> original mechanism) and the center pieces hold <b>the</b> central edges <b>in</b> <b>place</b> (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed with speedcubing in mind.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{complaints}} that the hawsepiper progression path {{has been made}} too difficult since the requirements of STCW 95 have been enacted.

25|$|As {{time went}} on by, space {{constraints}} posed a growing concern. Catechism classes for children were conducted <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sacristy and kitchen, thereby impeding on the priests’ privacy and opportunity for interaction. Hence, the Church decided {{to build a new}} extension that would {{meet the needs of the}} growing community. Construction on the new 4 storey extension began in early 2003.

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the mostly rural areas, the Cuban doctors discovered that many people suffered chronic, long-term illnesses. Instead of broken bones, they were treating river blindness and stunted growth. <b>In</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Mosquito Coast of Honduras, the Cubans were the first doctors the patients had ever seen. In support of this plan, ELAM was opened in March 1999 and started its full medical program in September 1999 with approximately 1,900 student in its initial classes. On November 15, 1999, Castro officially inaugurated ELAM at as Havana hosted the 9th Ibero-American Summit (at this time, ELAM had 1,929 students from 18 countries).|$|E
25|$|In the 16th and 17th century, the Dutch (particularly {{those from}} Holland and Zeeland) wielded {{considerable}} {{influence over the}} development of French wine. Their strength was their sizable merchant fleet and trading access across Northern Europe <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Baltic and Hanseatic states. When political conflicts between the French and English flared up, it was the Dutch who stepped in {{to fill the void}} and serve as a continuing link funneling the wines of Bordeaux and La Rochelle into England.

25|$|In {{temperate}} climates, where temperatures {{can reach}} above 10 °C (50 °F) in mid-winter, some early budding varieties (such as Chardonnay) {{can be at}} risk of premature bud break. This is a potential viticultural hazard <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Margaret River region of Western Australia where warm currents from the Indian Ocean can coax Chardonnay vines to prematurely bud in the mid-winter month of July. After bud break, the young shoots are very vulnerable to frost damage with vineyard managers going to great lengths protect the fragile shoots should temperature dramatically drop below freezing. This can include setting up heaters or wind circulators in the vineyard to keep cold air from settling on the vines.|$|E
25|$|During the night, nectar is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the cup of the flower. This is commonly associated with flowers specialising in pollination by bats. Common brown lemurs Eulemur fulvus were seen fouraging from Brexia flowers in the early morning. These primates took the inflorescences with their hands and bent these to lick the nectar from the flower cups. This was repeated in other nearby specimens of Brexia immediately after. Flowers were not damaged, {{and it is likely}} the lemurs assisted the pollination. B. madagascariensis grows in coastal vegetations on a range of soil types such as coral, sand, loam or coarse rocky ground, <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> edges of saline water swamp forest, mangrove swamps, evergreen shrubland and other forest types near the sea. In Tanzania it has been found in an almost pure stand of Maesopsis eminii. The fruit can float in sea water for many months and the numerous dark seeds within remain viable.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wine}} renaissance of the 1960s, {{the quality of}} California's dessert and {{fortified}} wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer {{was one of the}} first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to Botrytis cinerea spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this noble rot can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their Late Harvest wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style Muscat wines are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz. Some uniquely Californian styles are also made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.|$|E

25|$|Other criticisms {{center around}} the broader {{environmental}} impact of irrigation on both the ecosystem around the vineyard {{as well as the}} added strain on global water resources. While advances in drip irrigation has reduced the amount of waste water produced by irrigation, the irrigation of substantial tracts of land in areas like the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia requires massive amounts of water from dwindling supplies. In Australia, the centuries-old practice of flood irrigation used <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area caused severe environmental damages from water-logging, increase salination and raising the water tables. In 2000, the Australian government invested over A$3.6 million into research on how to minimize the damage caused by extensive irrigation. In 2007, concerns about ecological damage to the Russian River caused government officials in California to take similar measures to cut back water supplies and promote more efficient irrigation practices.|$|E
500|$|By 1850, White {{settlers}} established donation {{land claims}} in the Columbia Slough watershed. One settler, Lewis Love, became wealthy by cutting timber in the watershed and using the slough {{as part of a}} shipping route to downtown Portland. Other settlers logged the forests near the slough and built sawmills, fished, and farmed. In 1852, James John operated a ferry based on the peninsula of land between the Columbia and the Willamette River. The community of St. Johns, platted in the same year on the peninsula, is named after him. Legislation creating the Port of Portland in 1891 improved St. Johns' prospects as a Willamette River port. In 1902, the U.S. Congress passed a Reclamation Act that encouraged irrigation, flood control, and wetland development <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> peninsula.

500|$|Tidal {{flows of}} {{seawater}} are resisted by the water's inertia {{and can be}} affected by land masses. <b>In</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico where land constrains {{the movement of the}} bulges, only one set of tides may occur each day. Inshore from an island, there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides. The island straits at Chalkis on Euboea experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction, generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when the moon and the sun are 90 degrees apart. Where there is a funnel-shaped bay or estuary, the tidal range can be magnified. The Bay of Fundy in Canada can experience spring tides of [...] Although tides are regular and predictable, the height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds. The high pressure at the center of an anticyclones pushes down on the water and is associated with abnormally low tides while low-pressure areas may cause extremely high tides. A storm surge can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the sea at high tide dramatically. In 1900, Galveston, Texas, experienced a [...] surge during a hurricane that overwhelmed the city, killing over 3,500 people and destroying 3,636 homes.|$|E
