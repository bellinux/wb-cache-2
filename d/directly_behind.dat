The list also indicates whether a name has been insufficiently described (nomen nudum), is not taxonomically identifiable at the generic level (nomen dubium), or fallen out of use (nomen oblitum). Reclassifications under a different genus are mentioned behind the [...] "=" [...] sign; if the reclassification is today considered valid, it is listed under Reassigned species.|$|R

Stela53 forms a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture.

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E
50|$|The building, very {{possibly}} the town's oldest, is also its most visible, historic landmark. It {{sits in the}} central area of Great Yarmouth, close {{to the house of}} Anna Sewell. The Transitional clerestoried nave, with columns alternately octagonal and circular, was rebuilt in the reign of King John. A portion of the chancel is of the same date. About fifty years later the aisles were widened, so that the nave is now, rather unusually, the narrowest part of the building. Immediately adjacent are two main graveyard areas: the Old Yard lies <b>directly</b> east <b>behind</b> the church, while the very substantial New Yard stretches for about half a mile to the north.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{his debut}} in Mad, Neumans {{likeness}} {{has appeared on}} the cover of all but a handful of the magazines 500 issues, distinguished by jug ears, a missing front tooth, and one eye lower than the other. His face is rarely seen in profile; he has virtually always been shown in front view, <b>directly</b> from <b>behind,</b> or in silhouette. Harvey Kurtzman first spotted the image on a postcard pinned to the office bulletin board of Ballantine Books editor Bernard Shir-Cliff. [...] "It was a face that didnt have a care in the world, except mischief", recalled Kurtzman. Shir-Cliff was later a contributor to various magazines created by Kurtzman.|$|R
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it <b>directly</b> from <b>behind.</b> Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|R
5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> the screen.|$|E
5|$|The two-story IDF outpost sat {{northwest}} of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 20 people, {{including}} a security officer, were shot during the shooting incident at Maafushi prison. Fifteen of the 20 were shot above the knees and 9 {{of them were}} <b>directly</b> shot from <b>behind</b> while retreating. Six were shot from front and bullet entry points were not determinable in 5 persons. Abdualla Ameed died instantly due to being hit directly in the head. Two died in a Sri Lankan hospital while being treated.|$|R
50|$|During an out-of-plane maneuver, the attacker's nose {{no longer}} {{points at the}} defender. Instead, the {{aircraft}} is rolled until its lift vector, (an imaginary line running vertically {{from the center of}} the aircraft, perpendicular to its wings), is aligned either ahead of, <b>directly</b> at, or <b>behind</b> the defender, using roll rate instead of turn rate to set the proper pursuit curve. The aircraft's velocity vector, (an imaginary line in the direction of motion) will be pulled in the direction of the lift vector.|$|R

5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. <b>Directly</b> <b>behind</b> the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over {{the next two weeks}} the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> the Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E

[...] Given his placement {{at the front}} of the California student section <b>directly</b> between and <b>behind</b> the announcers, Sheu's cube-solve was immediately visible to audiences watching the game on ESPN2.

500|$|By {{the evening}} of 18 September, the 60th Division was {{deployed}} with the 180th Brigade in the lead and the 181st Brigade some [...] from Tulkarm, with the 179th Brigade in reserve.
