5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} the Senate, Johnson was called on to cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all of his predecessors save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some of his predecessors, Johnson never addressed the Senate {{on the occasion of}} a tie-breaking vote; he did once explain <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> via an article in the Kentucky Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member has}} one vote of equal weight, {{for which they}} can be held {{publicly}} accountable.

Representatives from the Treasury may attend the meeting, but only as non-voting observers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Ryan {{served on}} the joint, {{bipartisan}} National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission. He voted {{with the majority of}} the Commission not to advance its final report to Congress. Ryan justified <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> claiming that the Commission's recommendations did not do enough to reduce health care costs.|$|E

5|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{was present}} during oral arguments. He {{passed away in}} February, voiding <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> in the initial vote on the case's outcome and precluding any draft opinion he may have written from being {{published}} by the Court. The Court's 6-2 opinion was delivered on April 20, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Pascual Ruiz Huidobro stated that, {{since the}} {{authority}} that appointed Cisneros had expired, Cisneros {{should no longer}} have a place in the government. Huidobro felt that the Cabildo should be in government, as it was the representative of the people. Melchor Fernández, Juan León Ferragut and Joaquín Grigera supported <b>his</b> <b>vote,</b> among others.|$|E

5|$|The priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá then {{proposed}} that the Cabildo should receive the provisional command, until {{the formation of a}} governing junta made up of representatives from all populations of the Viceroyalty. Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga (who would be members of the Primera Junta some days later), Escalada and Argerich (or Aguirre) supported <b>his</b> <b>vote,</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|On February 27, 2008, {{allegations}} surfaced {{that two}} Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill, Independent MP Chuck Cadman a million-dollar {{life insurance policy}} in exchange for <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> {{to bring down the}} Liberal government in a May 2005, budget vote. If the story had been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence since, under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to bribe an MP.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one {{of seven}} members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) {{who voted against the}} Amash-Conyers {{amendment}} to limit Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. <b>His</b> <b>vote</b> has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The Black Pearl {{arrives at}} Shipwreck Cove where Barbossa {{attempts}} {{to persuade the}} Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the Pearls brig, revealing she is Calypso, and they promise to be together again.

5|$|The talk {{became more}} {{widespread}} during {{his junior year}} as McCoy was mentioned by several analysts and voters as a potential 2008 Heisman winner. McCoy was the unanimous front-runner in an October 20 poll of 10 Heisman voters conducted by the Rocky Mountain News. Tim Tebow, quarterback of the Florida Gators, had a vote as the 2007 winner. Seven games into the season he said that McCoy would have <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> {{at that point in}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing {{that it would}} put both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the way}} to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
5|$|When Giuliano della Rovere {{was elected}} Pope Julius II in 1503, {{he issued a}} bull annulling any papal {{election}} brought about by simony, and defrocking and excommunicating any cardinal who sold <b>his</b> <b>vote.</b> Although the twenty-six day reign of Pope Pius III intervened between Alexander VI and Julius II, the alleged unscrupulousness of the Borgia pope was still firmly in the institutional memory of the Roman Curia. While Cardinal {{during the reign of}} Alexander VI, Julius II had been assailed politically and often militarily outside the sturdy wall of his Castle of Ostia.|$|E
50|$|Bailey {{at first}} claimed {{that when he}} was chosen as an elector by state party {{convention}} he had not pledged to cast <b>his</b> <b>votes</b> for Nixon and Agnew. Bailey further claimed that since Wallace had won in the district he represented, he was obligated to cast <b>his</b> <b>votes</b> for Wallace and LeMay. He also claimed that he forgot all about it until a party official reminded him of his electoral duties.|$|R

5|$|Wickliffe {{served as}} a {{delegate}} to the 1864 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, casting <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> for George B. McClellan. In {{the final years of}} his life, he became totally blind. While visiting his daughter near Ilchester, Maryland, he fell gravely ill and died on October 31, 1869. He was buried in Bardstown Cemetery in Bardstown. During World War I, a U.S. naval ship was named in Wickliffe's honor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining <b>his</b> <b>vote,</b> Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast <b>his</b> <b>vote</b> on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E
