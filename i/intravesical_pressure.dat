40|$|A 29 -year-old man {{developed}} paraplegia at T- 10 level due to {{road traffic}} accident in 1972. Both kidneys were normal and showed good function on intravenous urography. Division of external urethral sphincter was performed in 1973. In 1974, cystogram showed retrograde filling of left renal tract, which was hydronephrotic. Left ureteric reimplantation was performed. Following surgery, cystogram revealed marked retrograde filling of left renal tract as before. Penile sheath drainage was continued. In 1981, intravenous urography revealed bilateral severe hydronephrosis. Left ureteric reimplantation was performed again in 1983. Blood pressure was 220 / 140 [*]mm[*]Hg; this patient was prescribed atenolol. Cystogram showed gross left vesicoureteral reflux. Intermittent catheterisation was commenced in 2001. In 2007, proteinuria was 860 mg/day. This patient developed progressive renal failure and expired in 2012. In a spinal cord injury patient with vesicoureteral reflux, the treatment should focus on abolition of high <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> rather than surgical correction of vesicoureteric reflux.

40|$|PURPOSE: SUI (Stress Urinary Incontinence) {{results from}} sudden {{increases}} in <b>intravesical</b> peak <b>pressures</b> exceeding urethral resistance leading to involuntary urine loss. Obesity and smoking are well established reversible {{risk factors for}} SUI and may alter <b>intravesical</b> peak <b>pressures.</b> BMI, smoking status, and other clinical factors were studied to determine their relationship to CIPP (maximal <b>Intravesical</b> Peak <b>Pressures</b> generated by Cough) in SUI complaining women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred nineteen women complaining of SUI were evaluated with medical history and urodynamics. Age, parity, comorbidities, previous surgery, BMI and history of smoking were obtained. The maximal <b>intravesical</b> peak <b>pressures</b> generated by cough (CIPP) and cough leak point pressure (CLPP) were acquired. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Current smokers and former smokers had similar CIPP (170 cmH 2 O and 170 cmH 2 O; p = 0. 5, respectively); Those individuals who had never smoked had significantly lower CIPP (140 cmH 2 O; p = 0. 000 and p = 0. 009 respectively). BMI was directly related to CIPP (r = 0. 41; p = 0. 000). Vaginal deliveries (r = - 0. 15, p = 0. 08) and diabetes (r = 0. 15, p = 0. 016) were also directly related to CIPP on univariate analysis. Only smoking status (p = 0. 000) and BMI (p = 0. 000) were independently significantly related to CIPP on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and smoking showed increased CIPP (maximal <b>Intravesical</b> Peak <b>Pressures</b> generated by Cough). While reduced BMI is related to lower CIPP, smoking cessation {{does not appear to}} diminish CIPP. These findings suggest that weight loss may reduce incontinence by CIPP modulation. However, the benefits of smoking cessation without additional lifestyle modification, may have no benefit to improve urinary incontinence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Systemic {{administration}} of cannabinoid agonists {{is known to}} reduce pain induced by bladder inflammation and to modulate cystometric parameters in vivo. We have previously reported that intravesical {{administration of}} a cannabinoid agonist reduces the electrical activity of bladder afferents under normal conditions. However, the effects of local activation of bladder cannabinoid receptors on afferent activity during inflammation are unknown. This study was aimed to assess the effects of intravesical administration of a cannabinoid agonist on the discharges of afferent fibers in inflamed bladders ex vivo. We also characterized the expression of CB 1 receptors in the bladder and their localization and co-expression with TRPV 1, a marker of nociceptive afferents. Results Compared to untreated animals, afferent fiber activity in inflamed bladders was increased for <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> between 10 and 40 mmHg. Local treatment with a non selective cannabinoid agonist (AZ 12646915) significantly reduced the afferent activity at <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> above 20 mmHg. This effect was blocked by AM 251 but not by AM 630 (selective for CB 1 and CB 2 respectively). Finally, CB 1 was co-expressed with TRPV 1 in control and inflamed bladders. Conclusion These results demonstrate that sensitization of bladder afferents induced by inflammation is partly suppressed by intravesical activation of cannabinoid receptors, an effect {{that appears to be}} mediated by CB 1 receptors. Also, TRPV 1 positive fibers were found to co-express CB 1, supporting the hypothesis of a direct action of the cannabinoid agonist on nociceptive afferents. Taken together, these results indicate a peripheral modulation by the cannabinoid system of bladder hypersensitivity during inflammation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{infiltration}} of the intravesical ureter {{of the normal}} bladder in the living, anesthetized animal with magnesium sulfate or physiological salt solution caused a reflux of urine into the ureter in 6 out of 18 guinea pigs (33 per cent); in 22 out of 27 rabbits (81 per cent), and in 14 out of 17 dogs (82 per cent). The vesical pressure necessary to produce this experimental reflux is low and ranges between 2 and 12 mm. of Hg; hydrostatic pressure of the bladder contents often sufficed to drive urine into the kidney pelvis. After an experimental reflux had occurred, increased vesical pressure often failed to {{raise the level of}} the regurgitant column in the ureters of rabbit and dog: these higher pressures had rendered an incompetent valve competent. Control pressures ranging between 8 and 40 mm. of Hg without a preceding infiltration, caused no reflux in the great majority of dogs. The amount of infiltrated fluid necessary to produce reflux varied from 0. 2 cc. in the guinea pig to 0. 5 to 2 cc. in dog. Spontaneous regurgitation, that is regurgitation without a preceding infiltration, was seen in 4 guinea pigs, 4 rabbits and 2 dogs. Antiperistalsis of the ureters, that is a wave of contraction passing from the bladder to the kidney, was never seen in our animals with experimental reflux. Biopsy of the bladder in rabbit and dog showed edema of the ureterovesical valves after infiltration in most of our animals. Hemorrhages into the submucosa in the neighborhood of the ureteral valves were observed in some. The bladders of 3 rabbits, exhibiting spontaneous reflux without infiltration showed pouting, edematous lips of the ureterovesical orifices. The cause of experimental regurgitation is a non-obstructive edema of the vesical valve; this edema renders the valve flap more rigid and therefore incompetent at relatively low <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures.</b> Higher <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> may again render the incompetent valve competent.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were classified into two groups according to whether they presented {{a risk factor for}} intra-abdominal hypertension. Nine <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressure</b> measures per patient were performed after different volume saline instillation. The first one was done without saline instillation and then by increments of 0. 5 mL/kg to a maximum of 4 mL/kg. Linear models for repeated measurements of <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressure</b> with unstructured covariance were used to analyze the variation of <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressure</b> measures according to the conditions of measurement (volume instilled). Pairwise comparisons of <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressure</b> adjusted mean values between instillation volumes were done using Tukey tests, corrected for multiple testing to determine an optimal instillation volume. Forty-seven patients with completed measures (nine instillations volumes) were included in the analysis.

40|$|Upper {{urinary tract}} {{complications}} {{have been reported}} in about 20 - 30 % of spinal cord injury patients. Their pathogenesis is linked to the presence of high-pressure uninhibited detrusor contractions, high leak point pressure and low bladder compliance.

The incidence of both urinary tract dilatation and vesicoureteral reflux was significantly lower in patients having intermittent catheterization (P = 0. 03 and 0. 04 respectively).

30|$|Here, {{we report}} {{for the first time}} about the laparoscopic {{neurostimulation}} of 146 consecutive patients who underwent a nerve-sparing laparoscopic-assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy type 3 for cervical cancer. In all cases, the bloodlessness of the procedure allowed an optimal laparoscopic neurostimulation without being influenced by fluid accumulation in the pelvis, and no complications occurred while dissecting the different nerves. During the laparoscopic procedure urodynamic testing was performed without problems of interference from the pneumoperitoneum or instrumentation through the port systems. Exchange of instruments decreased <b>intravesical</b> and rectal <b>pressure</b> by less than 9  cm of water and did not affect urethral pressure. Urodynamic recordings during the use of the diathermy in the surgical procedure were impossible to interpret: The current was transmitted to other structures causing stimulation that could not be applied selectively. Application of the electrical current using the bipolar probe was easily applied by introducing it through a 5 -mm trocar, while the handling of the tripolar probe was more complicated because of its thicker shaft (a 10 -mm trocar is reqired) and the need to touch the structure to be stimulated at all three electrode sites. The recordings of the urethral, rectal and <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were easily obtained using our setup, and their amplitudes showed good response to changes of the voltage applied to the structure. While electrostimulation of autonomic nerves induced measurable pressure changes even under relaxation, the stimulation of somatic nerves did not result in any measurable reaction in the EMG reading under the same conditions. Therefore, stimulation was performed without any muscle relaxant.|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine female Wister rats were made paraplegic by spinal cord transsection at the vertebral level T 8 -T 9 and sacrificed between D 21 and D 28. A further group (n = 9) was used as a control group. Each bladder was excised and placed in an organ bath where <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured. Pressure changes were divided in two well-defined groups: macro-transients and spikes. The effects of intravesical volume load and muscarinic (M) agonists were studied. RESULTS: We demonstrated a higher frequency, a longer duration, and a higher variance of duration in macro-transients in the neurogenic group. Intravesical volume load influenced the amplitude and frequency of macro-transients in both groups similarly. The effects of the muscarinic (M(2)) -selective agonist arecaïdine were different in neurogenic bladder; the effects of the non-selective muscarinic (M) -agonist carbachol were similar in both groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In this {{preliminary}} study we report {{the development of}} the video urodynamic technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 6 women with genuine stress urinary incontinence, diagnosed by history and physical examination. Urodynamic examination was performed on multichannel equipment with the patient in the supine position. Coughing and Valsalva maneuvers were performed at volumes of 150, 250 and 350 mL. Simultaneously, MRI was carried out by using 1. 5 T GE Signa CV/i high-speed scanner with real time fluoroscopic imaging possibilities. Fluoroscopic imaging was accomplished in the corresponding planes with T 2 -weighted single shot fast spin echo sequences at a speed of about 1 frame per second. Both studies were recorded and synchronized, resulting in a single video urodynamic examination. RESULTS: Dynamic MRI with cine-loop reconstruction of 1 image per second demonstrated the movement of all compartment of the relaxed pelvis during straining with the concomitant registration of abdominal and <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures.</b> In 5 patients, urinary leakage was demonstrated during straining and the Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) was determined as the vesical pressure at leak subtracted from baseline bladder pressure.

The approach employed was designed to circumvent the necessity for considerable lengths of bowel {{to be committed to}} valve formation and to avoid the tendency for desusception, present with other forms of nipple valves. Methods: A technique in which a subterminal segment of partial-thickness ileum was 2 ̆ 7 skinned 2 ̆ 7 circumferentially of serosa and muscularis propria and then intussuscepted to form a continent nipple-valve mechanism was studied for up to 4 months in 10 dogs. The intussuscepted partial-thickness ileal valve was in continuity with a terminal ileal segment sutured flush with skin and, internally, with another segment laid open and anastomosed to the bladder. Results: All valves were competent, withstanding <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 90 cm H 2 O. Six dogs were catheterized, without difficulty, twice daily up to 104 days. The valve mucosal surfaces were smooth due to a loss of plicae circulares, and, between 2 ̆ 7 back-to-back 2 ̆ 7 submucosal layers, a fine stroma developed.

The contracted bladder etiologies were SCI in 16 of patients (61. 5 %) and TBC in the remaining 10 patients (38. 4 %). The patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: The mean follow-up periods for patients with SCI and CTC were 98. 5 ± 31. 3 and 83. 2 ± 35. 3 months, respectively (p> 0. 05). Patients with SCI and CTC did not significantly differ with respect to the preoperative and postoperative mean bladder capacities or <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures.</b> As additional postoperative treatments, Clean Intermittent Self-Catheterization (CISC) was performed in 5 (31. 2 %) SCI patients, and anticholinergic treatment was administered to 3 SCI patients (18. 7 %). Anticholinergic treatment was used postoperatively in only one patient with CTC (10 %). Conclusion: Augmentation cystoplasty is a useful treatment for patients with SCI and CTC. The postoperative urodynamic studies in these patients were similar. However, the requirement for additional treatments in patients with SCI, including anticholinergic agents and CISC, is more frequent than in patients with CTC in the postoperative period. Therefore, patients with SCI should be warned about additional postoperative treatments before augmentation cystoplasty, and CISC should be taught to these patients...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Vanilloids like {{capsaicin}} and resiniferatoxin (RTX) {{have been}} used {{for more than a decade}} in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Recently, the vanilloid molecule piperine (PIP) has been shown to have similar pharmacological properties as these drugs. In this study, we looked at PIP-effects on autonomous bladder contractile activity, with particular interest for its selectivity for the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPV 1) receptor. Additionally, we studied the role of TRPV 1 in volume-induced contractile changes using selective and non-selective TRPV 1 antagonists. METHODS: The acute and prolonged effects of PIP were studied on rat bladders. Each bladder was excised and placed in a heated organ bath, where <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured. In acute experiments, PIP was added directly to the bathing solution. For prolonged effects, animals were pre-treated intravesically with vehicle (ethanol 5 %) or PIP (10 (- 4) M) and sacrificed 72 hr later. The effects of selective (capsazepine (CZP)) and non-selective (ruthenium red (RR)) TRPV 1 antagonists on volume-evoked contractile parameters were also studied. RESULTS: Acute administration of PIP 10 (- 4) M significantly increased amplitude of bladder contractions (P < 0. 05). These effects were significantly antagonized (P < 0. 05) by the TRPV 1 -selective antagonist CZP (10 (- 5) M) and the non-selective TRP-antagonist RR (10 (- 5) M). Intravesical pre-treatment with PIP induced shorter contractions with more periods of non-activity (P < 0. 05) compared to controls. Inhibition of TRPV 1 with CZP and RR significantly reduced the volume-evoked rise in contractile amplitude in isolated bladders (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: We found evidence for acute and prolonged effects of PIP on bladder contractility, which seem to be mediated through TRPV 1. Furthermore, we found evidence for involvement of TRPV 1 in afferent signaling of mechanical stimuli. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a vanilloid {{compound}} and agonist of the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPV 1), {{is known for}} its beneficial effects on neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The mainstream rationale for its use is the desensitization of TRPV 1 on sensory bladder afferents. However, recent findings showed that TRPV 1 is present in other cell types in the bladder. To eliminate the effects of RTX on spinal and central neural circuits, we investigated autonomous contractility in normal and neurogenic rat bladders after treatment with RTX. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were made paraplegic at vertebral level T 8 -T 9. Animals were intravesically pre-treated with vehicle (ethanol 5 %) or RTX (100 nM) and sacrificed after 72 hr. Each bladder was excised and placed in a heated organ bath, where <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured. Effects on contractile parameters of intravesical volume load, the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CA) and electrical stimulation (ES) of nerves were studied in both groups. RESULTS: In RTX-treated normal bladders we found shorter contractions with higher amplitude than in control bladders (P < 0. 05). In RTX-treated neurogenic bladders the amplitude and duration of autonomous contractions were increased compared with controls (P < 0. 05). Furthermore RTX induced an increased response to CA and to ES (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: RTX significantly affected the properties of autonomous bladder contractile activity. This provides evidence for local effects of RTX on bladder contractile activity, which are not mediated by afferent neural pathways and which may contribute to the beneficial effects on detrusor overactivity.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} oxybutynin in children with detrusor hyperreflexia due to neurological conditions. Study 1 [...] A prospective, open label trial of 3 formulations of oxybutynin (tablets, syrup and extended release tablets) was conducted for 24 weeks in children 6 to 15 years old with detrusor hyperreflexia who used oxybutynin and clean intermittent catheterization. The effect of treatment on average urine volume per catheterization and on secondary urodynamic outcomes was evaluated. Study 2 [...] The efficacy and safety of oxybutynin syrup were evaluated urodynamically in an open label study of children 1 to 5 years old with detrusor hyperreflexia who used oxybutynin and clean intermittent catheterization. Study 1 [...] Mean urine volume per catheterization (+/- SEM) increased by 25. 5 +/- 5. 9 ml (p < 0. 001). Maximal cystometric capacity increased by 75. 4 +/- 9. 8 ml (p < 0. 001). Mean detrusor and <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were significantly decreased by - 9. 2 +/- 2. 3 (p <or = 0. 001) and - 7. 5 +/- 2. 5 cm H 2 O (p < 0. 004), respectively, at week 24. Of 61 children with uninhibited detrusor contractions 15 cm H 2 O or greater at baseline 34 did not have them at week 24 (p < 0. 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that intravesical volume load increases amplitude and frequency of autonomous bladder contractions [1]. Thus local afferent-efferent reflexes, free from spinal and central neuronal pathways, seem {{to be involved in}} stretch-contractile responses in bladder. However the mechanisms underlying these stretch-evoked reflexes are still poorly understood. In the present study we looked at the role of the vanilloid transient receptor potential channel subtype- 1 (TRPV 1) in local stretch-evoked rat bladder contractility. MATERIAL & METHODS: Wistar rat bladders were used. Each bladder was excised,a pressure catheter was inserted and the bladder preparation was placed in a heated organ bath, where <b>intravesical</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured. The effects on autonomous bladder contractility of intravesical volume load (Krebs solution, 20 ml/min, 15 min) and of the TRPV 1 agonist piperine [2] (PIP, 10 mM) were studied. The effects of extravesical pre-treatment with TRP-antagonist ruthenium red (RR, 10 mM)) and TRPV 1 -antagonist capsazepine (CZP, 10 mM) on the stretch-contractile response were studied. These contractile responses were compared with data from untreated bladders. RESULTS: Intravesical volume load induced an increase in amplitude and frequency of autonomous bladder contractions. The TRPV 1 -agonist PIP provoked similar effects,which were effectively antagonized by CZP. CZP and RR induced a decreased rise in amplitude of contractions after intravesical volume load, compared with the control group (p< 0, 05). Intravesical volume load provoked an increase in duration of contractions in CZP-treated bladders (p< 0, 05), but not in RR-bladders or controls. Intravesical volume load induced a decrease in frequency of contractions in RR-treated bladders (p< 0, 05), but not in CZP-bladders or controls. The effects of volume load on baseline and on superimposed contractile activity were unaffected by CZP and RR CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for involvement of TRP-channels and TRPV 1 in particular in stretch-contractile responses in isolated rat bladders. TRPV 1 seems to act as a pressure-sensing molecule, necessary for evoking contractile responses on intravesical volume load. The pressure-contractile response can be modified in patients with overactive bladder disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of TRPV 1 in affected bladder sensing, and to look for possible therapeutical perspectives of interacting on TRPV 1 in functional bladder disorders. status: publishe...|$|R
