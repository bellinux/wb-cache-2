5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
25|$|O you, my lovely boy, {{who hold}} in your power Time's {{hour-glass}} and his sickle—you who wane {{as you grow}} older and in that show your friends withering as you yourself grow up: if Nature, sovereign mistress over chaos, as you go onwards will ever pluck you back, she keeps you to demonstrate her power to hold up time. Yet fear <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E
500|$|As a trial judge, she {{garnered}} {{a reputation}} for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule. [...] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, [...] "She does not have much patience for people trying to snow <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> can't do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And 'ow are {{you going}} to {{convince}} 'er of it?" [...] asked Jarman. [...] "You think your telling <b>'er</b> <b>you</b> loved <b>'er</b> proves it. So it would to anybody else, but not to <b>'er.</b> <b>You</b> can't expect it. Besides, if every girl is going to give up 'er catch just because the fellow 'adn't all 'is wits about 'im at the time--well, what do you think?" [...] He appealed to Minikin.|$|R

6000|$|... “No {{more than}} mine,” insisted the major; “and you’re {{worrying}} <b>her.</b> Will <b>you</b> hand <b>her</b> over, <b>you</b> selfish man, or must I take her by force?” ...|$|R
500|$|... "She {{was unhappy}} with the whole damn thing, so I went in and {{sweetened}} {{up a lot of}} music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the finest actresses of her generation and one of Britain's best-known actresses, accepted in Hollywood. Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a [...] "". The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, [...] "There is something about her which is— you just trust <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> just think 'I'm in proper hands here.' ... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers".|$|E
500|$|... "Distant Lover" [...] has Gaye crooning over serene instrumentation, {{leading to}} soulful screams near the end; from a heartbroken croon to an impassioned wail. The song's lyrics chronicled the yearning its narrator feels for a lover who is [...] "so many miles away", as he pleads for her return and laments the {{emptiness}} he feels without her. Music writer Donarld A. Guarisco later {{wrote of the}} song's sound, in that [...] "Marvin Gaye's studio recording enhances the dreamy style of the song with stately horn and strings, tumbling drum fills that gently nudge the song along, and mellow, doo wop-styled background vocals that echo [...] "love <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> love her" [...] under his romantic pleas. The song later became a concert favorite for Gaye and a live concert version, featuring female fans screaming in the background, was released as a single from his Marvin Gaye Live! album in 1974.|$|E
6000|$|... "And, after all," [...] the {{housekeeper}} continued, [...] "he has more right over <b>her</b> than <b>you</b> have. He {{is related to}} <b>her,</b> and <b>you</b> are only <b>her</b> friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George has no sister, no girl {{belonging}} to him; {{but if he}} had, and <b>you</b> loved <b>her,</b> would <b>you</b> abstain from marrying <b>her</b> lest <b>you</b> should sacrifice your--connections?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you can’t" [...] said Captain Barber, emphatically. [...] "And no more can’t I {{get rid of}} <b>’er.</b> <b>You</b> see, I ’appened to take {{a little}} notice of ’er." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I did {{all that}} {{stuttering}} in Logic. It's very, very complicated, slice by slice. You have to experiment a lot to make it work. I put Auto-Tune on individual syllables. Sometimes I use 40 tracks of audio just on one vocal track. Each has a different level and treatment, and then I do a composite. I couldn't do this with a normal analog studio setup. The starting and stopping thing, it's an idea I've had for [...] Normally, it takes about {{six months to a}} year for people I'm working with to understand my ideas. With Madonna, the first time she heard it, she loved it. She had a chemical reaction to it. She listened to it and she said, 'Okay, let's do it.' It's because of this that I love to work with <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to spend six months explaining things." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{scene where}} Sharon and Nick's mother Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) were searching the sewers {{for what they}} {{believed}} was Cameron's dead body became popular with fans of the show. Scott described the sewer shoot as a [...] "horrific day at work" [...] with [...] "20 live f--king rats on the set", while comparing the unlikely duo of Sharon and Nikki to Lucy and Ethel from I Love Lucy. Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's car trunk. Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine. She explained: [...] "Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was {{that for a long}} time. She was in this love story with Nick and nothing really happened to <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> can only carry that so far." ...|$|E
500|$|The script {{has been}} subject to a {{significant}} amount of misquotation. One of the lines most closely associated with the film—"Play it again, Sam"—is inaccurate. When Ilsa first enters the Café Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to [...] "Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake." [...] After he feigns ignorance, she responds, [...] "Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'." [...] Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, [...] "You played it for <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> can play it for me," [...] and [...] "If she can stand it, I can! Play it!" [...] Rick's toast to Ilsa, [...] "Here's looking at you, kid", used four times, was not written into the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to a comment Bogart said to Bergman as he taught her poker between takes. It was voted the fifth most memorable line in cinema in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells <b>her</b> <b>you</b> can do anything if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E

2500|$|On boxing: [...] "It's {{like being}} {{in love with a}} woman. She can be unfaithful, she can be mean, she can be cruel, but it doesn't matter. If you love <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> want her, even though she can do you all kinds of harm. It's the same with me and boxing. It can do me all kinds of harm but I love it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane continued, [...] "I do {{want people}} to know that she did work really hard. And she lost a lot of weight so that if you looked at <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I mean is {{that her}} heart was fixed that way before Reginald Morton was squire of Bragton. What shall I say in answer to <b>her</b> message? <b>You</b> will wish <b>her</b> happiness;--will <b>you</b> not?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} (ca. 2015), in Yedioth Ahronoth, Raichel was asked about this and said: [...] "If you have a daughter and someone kidnapped <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> investigate that someone and your child's life is at risk. If she is my daughter, I would do whatever necessary to {{know where she is}} and to get the information that would save her life. Regardless if that someone is Muslim, Jewish or Christian. It is an example of unnecessary harsh criticism. The intention of the things was taking out of context".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the trial}} Justice Michael Moldaver asked retired OPP officer Harry [...] "Hank" [...] Sayeau (who {{assisted}} Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might {{be responsible for}} Lynne's rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year-old: [...] "Did the thought ever cross your mind that, for someone to strangle her then sexually assault <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> might want {{to be looking for}} someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?" [...] "I don't recall that", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich, {{the final}} boss in the 2001 comedic video game Conker's Bad Fur Day (and its 2005 remake [...] ), is {{a parody of}} the Alien queen as it {{appeared}} in Aliens. Heinrich not only looks {{very similar to the}} queen in design, but the reference is further alluded when Conker uses a yellow, mechanical exoskeleton to defeat it, as well as using the line, [...] "Get away from <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> bitch!" [...] as Heinrich looked down upon Berri's body, which is a direct reference to Ellen Ripley battling the queen during the film's final act.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am," [...] she replied; [...] "I {{love her}} exceedingly, and am delighted {{to find that}} <b>you</b> like <b>her</b> too. <b>You</b> hardly {{mentioned}} anything of <b>her</b> when <b>you</b> wrote to me after your visit there." ...|$|R
