We have seen him pining for various women with no success, so I feel it is about time for him to have a romance. Whether she is the right woman for Luke is unimportant. But I would enjoy playing a love-struck Durville being lead sic astray." [...] In 2011 Luke returned to the show with a fiance, Zlata Waldheim. Urquhart enjoyed the way Luke followed Zlata around and stated; [...] "It's lot of fun to play the kind of romance. Luke has suffered from unrequited love for a long time, so it's great to have some love being given back to him." [...] However the staff soon realised that Zlata was manipulating Luke to drastically change him as a person, none more so than Luke's best friend, Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid). Urquhart stated that Luke did not mind about his poor treatment {{as long as he was}} pleasing Zlata and that Luke would do anything for love. Bella soon realised she was in love with Luke and was disorientated when Zlata placed her at the centre of the wedding organization. Phil Peloton (Costel Waldheim) believed that Luke could have tried harder with Zlata, stating, [...] "Luke is no Romanian man and that's a good thing in some ways, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> lift his game and man up a bit if he wants to keep Zlata". Luke soon realised he too was in love with Bella and put an end to his and Zlata's engagement. In 2012 through the manipulation of Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen), the two separated, but quickly reconciled. Several months later, the couple got engaged and Bella soon became a [...] "bridezilla".|$|E
40|$|WP 01 / 2004; Nowadays the {{innovation}} {{is one of}} the most important determinant for increasing the wealth of the nations. The patterns of technological innovation are studied by Economics of innovation. The aim of this paper is to prove that the origins of the Economics of innovation go back to many years before Schumpeter’s theory (1911), thank to the original studies of Rae. He really did not know much of any economics literature and developed most of his concepts on his own. J. Rae has recently been rediscovered as a genuine precursor of the endogenous growth theory. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be rediscovered a second time for his contribution to the understanding of the economic role played by {{the innovation}} and technology change within the economic system. The Scottish philosopher within his book Statement of Some New Principles on the Subject of Political Economy, issued in 1834, put forward the basis of the Economics of innovation individuating the nature, causes and effects of the technological progress on economic growth. The main results achieved are the importance of Rae’s work for the Economics of innovation and a definition of this branch which embodied the main concepts appeared during the history of the economic thought. Clearly, it is not complete definition, but it is the first step towards a completely individuation of the purpose of this important field of specialisation within the Economics...|$|E

Mark later accuses Kate of trying to make him jealous and Kate decides to put him behind her, by agreeing to go on an official date with Kyle.

Now and then, I raise my head (I am sitting on the hardest of wet seats, in the most uncomfortable of wet attitudes, but I don't mind it,) and notice that I am a whirling shuttlecock between a fiery battledore of a lighthouse on the French coast and a fiery battledore of a lighthouse on the English coast; but I don't notice it particularly, except to feel envenomed in my hatred of Calais. Then I go on again, 'Rich and rare were the ge-ems she- e-e-e wore, And a bright gold ring on her wa-and she bo-ore, But O her beauty was fa-a-a-a-r beyond'--I am particularly proud of my execution here, when I become aware of another awkward shock from the sea, and another protest from the funnel, and a fellow-creature at the paddle-box more audibly indisposed than <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> be-- 'Her sparkling gems, or snow-white wand, But O her beauty was fa-a- a-a-a-r beyond'--another awkward one here, and the fellow-creature with the umbrella down and picked up--'Her spa-a-rkling ge-ems, or her Port! port! steady! steady! snow-white fellow-creature at the paddle-box very selfishly audible, bump, roar, wash, white wand.' ...|$|R
