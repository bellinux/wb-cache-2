5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century, Parkinson helped {{to ensure the}} {{popularity}} of the <b>daffodil</b> as a cultivated plant by describing a hundred different varieties in his Paradisus Terrestris (1629), and introducing the great double yellow Spanish <b>daffodil</b> (Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno or Parkinson's <b>Daffodil,</b> see illustration) to England.|$|E
5|$|The <b>daffodil</b> and the leek {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} leek {{can be traced to}} the 16th century, while the <b>daffodil</b> became popular in the 19th century, {{encouraged}} by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, and that for <b>daffodil,</b> cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as playful synonyms of the name. In common parlance and in historical documents, the term <b>daffodil</b> may refer specifically to populations or specimens of the wild <b>daffodil,</b> N. pseudonarcissus. H. N. Ellacombe suggests this may be from Saffon Lilly, citing Prior in support, though admittedly conjectural.|$|E
5|$|While Shakespeare's <b>daffodil</b> is {{the wild}} or true English <b>daffodil</b> (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, {{particularly}} N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all {{and every one of}} them in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or <b>daffodil</b> is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the <b>daffodil</b> or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the <b>Daffodil</b> in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks of {{introduction}} of decorative plants in botanical gardens is identification {{of the most promising}} species, forms and varieties suitable for use in the landscaping practice. The genus Narcissus L. is a highly popular decorative culture with more than 30, 000 varieties as of today. The purpose of this work is to identify varieties with high decorative effect and environmental sustainability for use in mass growing within the piedmont Crimea. Evaluation of the Narcissus sortment was held from 2011 to 2015. The subjects of research were 30 varieties of <b>daffodils</b> from the collection of the N. V. Bagrov Botanic Garden of the Tavrida Academy of the V. I. Vernadsky Crimean Federal University. In order to determine the merits of <b>daffodils,</b> the methods of variety testing of decorative plants were used. In addition, we have developed a 100 -point scale integrated assessment of decorative and practical traits. The scale includes 14 main features. Seven of these features characterize decorative qualities of the flowers, the other seven – practical qualities. As a result of phenological observations, it was established that the beginning phase of vegetation varieties Narcissus hybridus hort. in the conditions of piedmont Crimea falls on mid-February –early March. The total period of the flowering season makes 28 - 55 days. The evaluation determined six (6) unpromising, thirteen (13) average promising and eleven (11) highly promising varieties. The highly promising varieties are 'Ice Follies', 'Kissрroof', 'Pink Charm', 'Salome', 'Serola', (Large-cupped <b>Daffodils),</b> 'Curlew', 'Pipit' (Jonquilla <b>Daffodils),</b> 'Tahiti' (Double <b>Daffodils),</b> 'Mount Hood' (Trumpet <b>Daffodils),</b> 'Jetfire' (Cyclamineus <b>Daffodils)</b> and 'Lemon Beauty' (Split Corona <b>Daffodils).</b> They are recommended for use in landscaping practice within the piedmont Crimea...|$|R

5|$|John Horsefield (18 July 1792– 6 March 1854) was an English {{handloom}} weaver {{and amateur}} botanist after whom the <b>daffodil</b> Narcissus 'Horsfieldii' is named.

5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the <b>daffodil.</b> Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E

5|$|The genus {{appeared}} {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 24 million years ago, in the Iberian peninsula. While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection. In the English language the common name <b>Daffodil</b> appears to be derived from the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the <b>daffodil</b> fields prior to {{harvesting}} the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting.

While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
