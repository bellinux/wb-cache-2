500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and I {{was waiting for}} the records to finish. And I noticed people was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it <b>going.</b> <b>Like</b> a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by <b>going</b> <b>like,</b> 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|E
500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{contains}} heavily sexual lyrics. MTV's Jenna Hally Rubenstein {{wrote that}} Usher sings about a [...] "hot chick and how it'll {{be a total}} cinch {{for him to get}} her home", in the line [...] "I see you over there, so hypnotic/ Thinking 'bout what I do to that body.../ Got no drink in my hand/ But I'm wasted/ Getting drunk of the thought of you naked/ I get you like ooh, baby, baby." [...] In the chorus, he sings [...] "If you wanna scream ‘yeah,’ let me know and I’ll take you there / Get you <b>going</b> <b>like</b> a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby, a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby / If you want it done right, hope you’re ready to go." [...] DJ Booth depicted the track to be about orgasms. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner wrote that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "sex-fuelled lyrics" [...] portrayed in the line [...] "I see you over there so hypnotic/ Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body".|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>like</b> 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge <b>going</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{was also}} writing music reviews {{and when asked}} in 2003 what his favourites were, he said [...] "Most of my favourites are still <b>going</b> <b>like</b> The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico.

2500|$|On 9 May, one {{day after}} the {{violence}} in Medan ended, President Suharto left the country for a Group of 15 summit in Cairo, Egypt. Prior to his departure, he called on the public to end the protests. To the Suara Pembaruan daily newspaper, he said, [...] "I judge that if we keep <b>going</b> <b>like</b> this there will be no progress." [...] He later returned to Indonesia earlier than scheduled on 14 May, when violence in Jakarta reached its worst. The campus of Trisakti University in Grogol, West Jakarta, became the site of a gathering of 10,000 students on 12 May. They had planned on marching south toward the Parliament building, but security forces refused to allow them to leave the campus. When the students conducted a sit-in outside the campus gates, shots broke out after rocks were allegedly thrown at police. In the ensuing chaos, four students were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Live Through This {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the band's noise rock roots toward a more radio-friendly rock format. Love had sought a more mellow sound for Live Through This, stating: [...] "I want this record to be shocking to the people who don't think we have a soft edge, and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge." [...] The resulting music was starkly less aggressive than the band's former work, blending more structured melodies and smoother arrangements with heavy guitar riffs. [...] "During the tour for Pretty on the Inside, we had been going more pop, less journal-entry noise stuff," [...] recalled Erlandson. [...] "The whole industry was <b>going,</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Look, you can be melodic and punky and be successful!" [...] We never said [...] "Let's do this, let's copy this formula." [...] It was natural." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna {{contributed a}} new song titled [...] "Masterpiece" [...] for the soundtrack, {{composed}} by herself, Julie Frost and Jimmy Harry, while produced by Orbit. In the song, she sings about the pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics <b>going</b> <b>like</b> [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] A writer from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus going on like: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece." [...] The song plays over the end credits of W.E. and would be included in Madonna's upcoming album, MDNA. The soundtrack was released digitally through Interscope Records, on January 31, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the crisis, Illinois Governor Thomas Ford traveled to Hancock County, and on June 21, {{he arrived at the}} county seat in Carthage. On June 22, Ford wrote to the Mayor and City Council of Nauvoo, proposing a trial by a non-Mormon jury in Carthage, the county seat, and guaranteed Smith's safety. Smith fled the jurisdiction to avoid arrest, crossing the Mississippi River into Iowa. [...] On June 23, a posse under the command of Ford entered Nauvoo to execute an arrest warrant, but they were unable to locate Smith. [...] After Smith was criticized by some followers, he returned and was reported to have said, [...] "If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none to myself." [...] Smith reluctantly submitted to arrest. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>like</b> a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold blood." [...] On June 25, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with the other fifteen city council members and some friends, surrendered to Carthage constable William Bettisworth on the original charge of riot.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get <b>going</b> <b>like</b> that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E
