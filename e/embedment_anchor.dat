40|$|Anchor drag during {{operation}} of offshore structures could significantly alter the initial load design {{characteristics of a}} mooring system. Hence an estimation of anchor positions {{during operation}} is essential to identify whether slow or abrupt anchor motion occurs and might require the redeployment of an anchor. During storm conditions, monitoring of mooring tensions and structure motions at the South West Mooring Test Facility (SWMTF) revealed the slow drift motion of one anchor. This facility is a surface buoy with a three-legged, compliant mooring system designed to investigate mooring system behaviour for Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) devices. This paper presents i) some methods to identify the deployment anchor positions: numerical model, acoustics diver survey, and towed sonar ii) the analyses procedure, and estimations of slow drift anchor motion. The findings indicate that one drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchor</b> moved slowly during a moderate but prolonged and isolated storm, before embedding again. The work demonstrates that anchor position can be accurately monitored and that anchor motion is not necessarily due to excessive peak loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrete}} element {{method was}} applied to model the impact force of woody debris (trees) on hydrokinetic infrastructure in a river setting. The DEM model, termed the Hydrokinetic Debris Impact Simulator (HDIS) was used to investigate interactions of debris with UAF’s research debris diversion platform (RDDP). The RDDP was designed to protect river energy converters and other hydrokinetic energy infrastructure from floating, woody debris. The RDDP is typically tethered to a surface float that is connected by line and chain to an <b>embedment</b> <b>anchor</b> upstream and below the river bottom. Surface mounted turbines are then tethered behind the RDDP. In this way, the RDDP protects hydrokinetic infrastructure from the impact of trees. HDIS successfully models the interaction and dynamics of discrete bodies (in this case, debris and the RDDP) and determines the forces and torques acting on these bodies due to contact, water, and other, external forces. A key component of the discrete element method is the contact model describing particle-particle interactions. Overall, the discrete element method allows for a realistic simulation of debris-RDDP interactions. In order to improve the fidelity of the drag and buoyancy forces {{as well as the}} debris behavior, HDIS was coupled to a CFD package, OpenFOAM. The OpenFOAM package allows for realistic simulations of the complex hydrodynamics that contribute to the RDDP’s ability to effectively shed debris {{and at the same time}} broadens the utility of HDIS for simulating more complex debris-infrastructure interactions including evaluating failure modes of the RDDP. Example results from HDIS are shown in Figure 1 and output from an OpenFOAM simulation of the flow field around the RDDP are shown in Figure 2. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{hurricane}} {{events of}} the past decade are responsible for several drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchor</b> (DEA) mooring failures of mobile offshore drilling platforms stationed within the Gulf of Mexico. A proposed failure mechanism is caused by out-of-plane loading. The current status of DEA holding capacity is based on empirical design charts and does not include the effects of out-of-plane loading. Experimental modeling using a 1 : 10 scale generic DEA was performed at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A & M University {{to examine the effects of}} out-of-plane load conditions. Instrumentation and specialized devices were constructed to measure the anchor's trajectory through a representative sample of Gulf of Mexico clay with average un-drained shear strength of 0. 764 kPa (16 psf). The sediment basin allowed for drag distances of 4. 87 m (16 ft) and an embedment depth of 1. 37 m (4. 5 ft). The measurements included pitch and roll of the anchor and line tension measured at the shank pad-eye. The variables modeled were fluke angle settings of 22 ?, 36 ? and 50 ?. The initial towline angle was varied from a minimum of 5 ? to upwards of 20 ?. Surface out-of-plane angles of 45 ? and 90 ? and embedment loading of 15 ?, 30 ? and 45 ? were examined. Curves of the ultimate holding capacity with respect to the out-of-plane towline angle and ultimate embedment depth were developed as functions of out-of-plane loading angles. Analysis of the rate effect indicates that a 46 percent increase in towing velocity causes an average 3 percent increase of holding capacity. The 50 ? fluke angle embeds an average of 0. 7 fluke lengths deeper and has a holding capacity of 0. 73 units greater than the 36 ? setting. The surface out-of-plane tests have a 5. 1 percent reduction in holding capacity as the out-of-plane load angle increases from 45 ? to 90 ?. For all one fluke length initial towing distance tests, the ultimate holding capacity increases and the ultimate embedment depth decreases as the out-of-plane towing angle increases from 15 ? to 45 ?. The three fluke length initial towing distance tests indicate a contrasting trend, in that as the out-of-plane tow angle increases, both the ultimate holding capacity and ultimate embedment depth decrease...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{experimental}} and analytical modeling {{in the field}} of deep water offshore anchoring technologies is high. Suction caisson and drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> (DEA) are common anchors used for mooring structures in deep water. The installation process of drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> has been highly empirical, employing a trial and error methodology. In the past decade analytical methods have been derived for modeling DEA installation trajectories. However, obtaining calibration data for these models has not been economical. The development of a small scale experimental apparatus, known as the Laponite Tank, was developed for this thesis. The Laponite Tank provides a quick and economical means of measuring DEA trajectories, visually. The experimental data can then be used for calibrating models. The installation process of suctions caissons has benefited from from a more rational approach. Nevertheless, these methods require refinement and removal methodology requires development. In this thesis, an algorithm for modeling suction caisson installation in clay has been presented. An analytical method and modeling algorithm for removal processes of suction caissons in clay was also developed. The installation and removal models were calibrated to field data. These analytical and experimental studies can provide a better understanding of installation of drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> and the installation and removal of suction caissons...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of properly designing and selecting an anchor {{is key to}} reliable techniques for floating offshore platforms including power generation from marine currents. Numerous studies have demonstrated how the uplift capacity of <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> is highly dependent on the soil properties and the anchor geometry. This work focuses in detail {{on the behavior of}} vertically loaded circular anchors to keep a floating structure stationary in the offshore environment. The main goal of this research was to find and evaluate an alternative to the foundations employed in the M. Eng. 2009 / 10 offshore project. The initial option consisted of drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> and suction anchors as the foundations for the floating structure located in the Messina Strait that carries a horizontal-axis marine current turbine. Examining past theories and tests, and using dimensional analysis, we determined that circular plate anchors of 4. 22 m and 2. 72 m in diameter represent a good alternative design for the foundations of the front and back floating platforms. These <b>anchors</b> have an <b>embedment</b> depth-to-diameter ratio of 3 and a plate thickness-to-diameter ratio of 3 %. Therefore, in comparison to the initial foundation options developed in the M. Eng. project, the solution with circular anchors has the advantage to reduce the overall dimensions of the anchors, reduce the material necessary for their manufacture, minimize the duration and cost of installation, and provide an efficient anchoring system independent of the local current direction. by Antonioluca Manno.

40|$|The use of shallow <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> in {{concrete}} {{is essential for}} retrofit applications; however, the combination of steel anchors, chemical adhesive, and concrete acting as a single tensile mechanism creates uncertainties in anchor strength and failure modes. Differences {{in concrete}} compressive strengths and in specifications of adhesives between manufacturers increases uncertainty further. In addition to these issues, prior research conducted by others examines the behavior of such anchors with respect to cracked versus uncracked concrete, partial bonding of the embedded length, and strength reductions due to anchor proximity to edges. While it is understood, anchors require a proper installation detail, {{the goal of this}} research is to understand the failure mechanisms and capacity when such conditions cannot be met. One example of a limiting case is a retrofitted bridge where shallow anchors are the only option.

Additional experimental investigations were conducted to determine what, if any, differences existed between these provisions and specifications that included partially bonded anchors, anchors installed within an edge condition, and the differences between reinforcement surface coatings (epoxy vs plain or black). Excluding the edge tests which exhibited poor performance, most anchors exhibited a combined failure mode of concrete cone with steel rupture and reached capacities of 11. 5 to 12. 5 kips.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the applications of plastic limit analysis to offshore foundations and anchors, including the drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> (DEAs) for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU?s) and spudcan foundations for jack-up platforms. In deep waters, drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> are an attractive option for mooring of semisubmersible platforms due to low installation cost and high holding capacity; {{on the other}} hand, jack-up platforms are more stable than semisubmersible platforms but only can be placed in shallow waters. The analyses of anchor capacities are developed for an idealized anchor comprising a rectangular fluke, a cylindrical shank, and a metal chain connected to the shank at the padeye. The anchor trajectory prediction during drag embedment is also developed by considering anchor behavior {{in conjunction with the}} mechanics of the anchor line. The results of simulations show that anchors approach at equilibrium condition rapidly during the embedment and both the normalized holding capacity and the anchor line uplift angle remain constants in this stage. Besides the geometry of the fluke, the properties of the shank and soil are also crucial factors in the anchor-soil interaction behavior. Partial failure of mooring systems for floating structures will subject drag anchors to loads having an appreciable component outside of the intended plane of loading. Partial failure of mooring systems during hurricanes in recent years have generated an interest in understanding drag anchor performance under these conditions. The analysis {{presents the}} simulations of three dimensional trajectories of an anchor system subjected to an out-of-plane load component. For the conditions simulated in the example analyses, the anchor experienced a modest amount of continued embedment following partial failure of the mooring system; however, the ultimate embedment and capacity of the anchor is much less than what would have developed if the anchor had continued in its original trajectory within the plane of intended loading. The analyses of the spudcan foundation of jack-up units include preloading, bearing capacity, and the displacement assessment. When the contribution of the soil moment resistance is considered, a three-stage assessment procedure is recommended: superposing environmental forces on the plot of yield surface, determining the value of yield function corresponding to the external forces, and computing the factor of safety of the spudcan. The results of the assessment may be ambiguous while the different yield functions are employed to analyze the spudcan in soft clay...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A drag anchor is a marine foundation element, which is penetrated into the seabed by dragging in order to generate a required capacity. The holding capacity of a drag anchor in a particular soil condition is developed by soil resistance acting on the anchor. This capacity also includes the resistance developed by the anchor line in the soil. This study is concerned with the collection of measured data and an evaluation of existing prediction methods for capacity and penetration depth of anchors embedded in clayey soils. Both vertically loaded anchors (VLA) and drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> (DEA) are considered in this study. Test data from six different sites where anchors have been tested or employed for projects have been collected as a basis of comparison between existing prediction methods and field measurements. Theoretical methods proposed by Stewart (1992) and Neubecker and Randolph (1996 b) are considered as well as empirical solutions developed by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) and anchor manufacturing companies, Vryhof and Bruce. It is concluded that the existing prediction methods exhibit considerable variability compared with measured penetration depths and capacities {{depending on the type of}} anchor (VLA and DEA).

40|$|Drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> (DEA) {{are widely}} used for the temporary, {{and to a lesser}} extent the {{permanent}} mooring of offshore structures. While they can provide an effective mooring solution, the most commonly used design method, the empirical design charts, leave a high level of uncertainty in prediction of the capacity and trajectory of installed anchors. While this is partially alleviated through the standard of proof loading installed anchors, improved models are needed to help predict the complete capacity and trajectory of the anchors. The presence of layered soils presents an especially complex challenge, which is beyond the scope of most current models. Instead, designers must rely on past experience in the region and designer judgment to estimate if the anchor will be able to penetrate through these challenging soils. Plastic limit analysis (PLA) allow the incorporation of analytical solutions and geotechnical principles into the design of DEA. In PLA models, the behavior of the anchor is governed by a yield locus, which combined with an incremental kinematic model it can be used to estimate the capacity and movement of the anchor as it advanced through the soil. The model proposed here is a simplified PLA that assumes a steady state condition as the anchor is embedded. In this state, the anchor load angle or padeye angle is assumed to align with the anchors fluke-shank angle resulting in a condition of zero moment and simplified rotational behavior. The model is then compared to a series of existing design charts, and results from full-scale field installations. To address the issue of layered soils the framework of the model is then expanded to allow for the inclusion of stiff layers of clays. The stiff layers are analyzed through the use of area transformations and multipliers equivalent to the area of the anchor embedded into the layer. As no non-proprietary data is available to validate the model at this time, the model is then simulated through a number complex configurations to see how it captures known behavior...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this record. This paper discusses several new technologies for mooring floating marine energy converter (MEC) devices, such as wave energy generators, tidal current turbines and floating wind turbines. The principal mooring component is a special nylon fiber rope which provides cyclic tension fatigue endurance much superior to that of conventional nylon ropes. The nylon fiber is treated with a new proprietary coating which has excellent wet yarn abrasion properties. The parallel-subrope type rope construction further reduces internal abrasion. Extensive laboratory testing was carried out on this new nylon rope design. Cyclic tension fatigue tests were conducted at mean loads and load amplitudes typical of actual service conditions and at higher mean loads and amplitudes. These tests demonstrate that the special nylon rope has essentially the same, desirable stretch characteristics as conventional nylon rope and has much better endurance performance. The mooring connection to the floating MEC device consists of a high-modulus fiber rope pendant which passes through a low-friction bell-mouth nylon fairlead on the MEC device. This eliminates the use of heavy, unreliable chain in this critical connection. A unique bag anchor system would be used on sand, clay, rock and other sea beds in which conventional drag <b>embedment</b> <b>anchors</b> and driven piles are impractical. The bag anchor consists of a large abrasion resistant carcass with lifting straps and top closure. The bag is transported to site in a collapsed form and is filled with local sand or aggregate to provide ballast weight. Several or many such bags are enclosed within a fiber rope net for deployment and are grouped together for connection to the mooring line. The paper will be {{of particular interest to}} designers of moorings for MEC systems in shallow water and severe wave environments. It will also be of interest for other mooring applications.

In a typical installation, an anchor is fully embedded into the seabed (up to 100 m). This {{has to be done}} with high fidelity as anchor failure can cause floating units to go adrift, damaging oil and gas pipelines. The likelihood of this happening may be reduced with a data acquisition system comprising various sensors/measurement instruments housed in the anchor, where their data is then transmitted in some ways towards the seabed, and then onwards to the installation vessel. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of electromagnetic wave underground wireless communications as a low cost means to transmit key anchor parameters from the anchor to the seabed.

As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor) is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of plate anchor foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson installation effect {{with the aim of}} generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and ‘vented’ (no suction on rear face), anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11. 6 and 11. 7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13. 1 and 13. 7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/γ'B or su/γ'D. Numerical simulation has been conducted to assess the bearing capacity for inclined pullout plate anchors. This bearing capacity analysis was performed by embedding the anchors in clay with different initial inclinations and different embedment ratios. Both the attached anchor base and vented base were evaluated. The results showed that the bearing capacities of the inclined plate anchors were associated with the inclination angles and base conditions. The separation depth of the plate anchors can be assessed by a simple equation from vertically pulled out plate anchors. Large deformation finite element analyses of plate anchor keying in clay has been performed. The effects of anchor thickness, anchor padeye eccentricity, anchor-soil interface roughness, soil shear strength, anchor submerged weight and soil disturbance have been studied with anchors in uniform or normally consolidated clays. The numerical results were compared with transparent soil test and existing centrifuge test data. The study showed that the RITSS method works well in simulating the anchor keying process. Anchor padeye eccentricity {{played an important role in}} anchor keying. A normalised anchor geometry ratio was used to estimate the loss in <b>embedment</b> during plate <b>anchor’s</b> keying. Both finite element analysis and centrifuge tests have been conducted to study the suction caisson installation effect. In finite element analysis, the soil disturbed zone varied from 3 times the caisson wall thickness to a full area inside a caisson. Centrifuge tests of suction embedded plate anchors were conducted in normally consolidated kaolin clay and transparent uniform soil. It can be concluded that the reduction in anchor capacity due to soil disturbance after suction caisson installation depends on re-consolidation time and soil sensitivity. The soil disturbance also reduced the loss of <b>embedment</b> during the <b>anchor</b> keying process...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket or dart shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes. Similar to other dynamically installed anchors, the DEPLA penetrates to a target depth in soft seabed sediments by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall in water and the self-weight of the anchor. In this paper DEPLA performance was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests conducted at 200 times earth?s gravity. The results show that the DEPLA exhibits similar behaviour to other dynamically installed anchors during installation, with tip embedments of 1. 6 – 2. 8 times the anchor length. After anchor installation the central shaft of the DEPLA, termed a follower, is retrieved and reused for the next installation, leaving the DEPLA flukes vertically embedded in the soil. The load–displacement response during follower retrieval is of interest, with mobilisation of frictional and bearing resistance occurring at different rates. The load required to extract the DEPLA follower is typically less than three times its dry weight. The vertically embedded DEPLA flukes constitute the load bearing element as a circular or square plate. The keying and pullout response of this anchor plate is similar to other vertically embedded plate anchors, with an initial stiff response as the anchor begins to rotate, followed by a softer response as the rotation angle increases, and a final stiff response as the effective eccentricity of the padeye reduces and anchor capacity is fully mobilised. For the padeye eccentricity ratios considered (0. 38 – 0. 63 times the plate breadth or diameter), the loss in plate <b>anchor</b> <b>embedment</b> is between 0. 50 and 0. 66 times the corresponding plate breadth or diameter. Finally, the bearing capacity factors determined experimentally are typically in the range 14. 2 – 15. 8 and are higher than numerical solutions for flat circular and square plates. This is considered to be due to the cruciform fluke arrangement which ensures that the failure surface extends {{to the edge of the}} orthogonal flukes and mobilises more soil in the failure mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the potential of}} plate anchors as an anchoring option for offshore renewable energy devices such as wave energy converters and floating offshore wind turbines. In this study {{the performance of a}} plate anchor vertically installed in sand and subjected to vertical loading has been investigated experimentally. Particular focus was placed on the unrecoverable loss of embedment during the keying process, where the orientation of the plate evolves from vertical to perpendicular to the direction of loading. This is particularly significant for offshore plate anchors as an unrecoverable loss in <b>anchor</b> <b>embedment</b> corresponds with a loss in potential anchor capacity. The loss in embedment during keying was examined for six anchors, all with the same plate geometry, but with anchor padeyes (or load attachment points) that were at differing eccentricities from the plate. The experiments were conducted at model scale using the geotechnical centrifuge at the Institute of Technology Sligo. To facilitate observation of the anchor orientation and quantification of the loss in embedment during the test, anchor tests were conducted adjacent to a Perspex panel on the centrifuge strongbox. Vertical loading was achieved by pulling a mooring line attached to the anchor padeye at a constant velocity. The location and orientation of the anchor during each anchor test was captured using a high resolution digital camera mounted {{directly in front of the}} Perspex panel. The experimental data show that the loss in embedment of the plate anchor during keying is inversely proportional to the padeye eccentricity, with a padeye eccentricity equal to at least the breadth of the anchor plate giving minimal loss in embedment and hence highest potential anchor capacity. The magnitude of the loss in embedment is very similar to previous findings for clay. The peak anchor capacity was observed before the end of keying, at a plate orientation between 50 and 80 degrees to the horizontal. Particle image velocimetry was employed to reveal the failure mechanisms during the keying process. These analyses showed that the peak load corresponds with a sudden transition from a deep localised failure mechanism to a shallow mechanism that extends to the soil surface. The anchor capacity, expressed in terms of a dimensionless capacity factor, was shown to be in good agreement with previously reported experimental data on pipelines and strip anchors, but only after the peak anchor capacity is exceeded and the anchor behaves like a horizontally oriented anchor subjected to vertical loading. The particle image velocimetry analyses show that the inclination of the slip planes in the shallow failure mechanism are at an angle that is much lower than would be reasonable for a mobilised friction angle. This clearly shows that the normality condition, in which the dilation angle and the friction angle are equal, was not met in these tests and explains why the experimental data are in good agreement with predictions from a limit equilibrium method based on similar principles...|$|R
