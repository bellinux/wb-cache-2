40|$|There is now {{widespread}} acceptance {{that human}} activities {{are contributing to}} observed climate change. Human-induced climate change {{has the potential to}} alter the prevalence and severity of rainfall extremes, storm surge and floods. Recognition of the risks associated with climate change is required for better planning of new infrastructure and mitigating potential damage to existing infrastructure. Policy makers, planners and the designers of hydraulic structures will need to base their decisions on up-to-date information from reliable sources. This paper describes the <b>Interim</b> <b>Guideline</b> for Climate Change for Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) which outlines an approach to address the risks from climate change in projects and decisions that involve estimation of design flood characteristics. The <b>Interim</b> <b>Guideline</b> draws on the most recent climate science, particularly the release of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in September 2013 as well as the new climate change projections for Australia. For consistency with the new Intensity-Frequency-Duration design rainfall estimates for ARR, the <b>Interim</b> <b>Guideline</b> is intended to be applied to the key system design event (i. e., the design standard for the structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for current-day rainfall intensities within the range of probability of one exceedance per year and annual exceedance probabilities from 50 % to 1 %. Bryson C.

Updated <b>interim</b> <b>guidelines</b> for healthcare providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age include a new recommendation to offer serologic testing to asymptomatic pregnant women (women who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease) who have traveled to areas with ongoing transmission of Zika virus. Updated guidelines for healthcare providers caring for infants and children with possible Zika infection have been expanded to cover children up to 18 years old, and contain a new recommendation to provide routine care to infants with no abnormal findings on prenatal or postnatal ultrasound, normal physical examination and whose mothers were not previously tested for Zika virus infection. The guideline document contains new recommendations {{for the care of}} infants and children with possible acute Zika virus disease.

5000|$|In October 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued <b>interim</b> <b>guidelines</b> for patent {{examiners}} {{to determine}} if a given claimed invention meets the statutory requirements of being a useful process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (...) [...] These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result to be patentable. It does not matter whether the process is within the traditional technological arts or not. A price for a financial product, for example, {{is considered to be a}} concrete useful and tangible result (see State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group). However, on August 24, 2009, the USPTO issued new <b>interim</b> <b>guidelines</b> so that examination would comport with the Federal Circuit opinion in In re Bilski, which held that the [...] "useful, concrete, and tangible" [...] test for patent-eligibility is incorrect and that State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group is no longer valid legal authority on this point. Instead, the Federal Circuit and the new USPTO guidelines use a Machine-or-Transformation Test to determine patentability for processes. The Supreme Court determined that the claims in the Bilski case covered non-statutory subject matter as it was too abstract and broad.|$|R
