If the targeted B-field is larger than the earth magnetic <b>field</b> (<b>maximum</b> value around 60 &micro;T), the sensor {{does not need to be}} very sensitive. To measure the earth field larger than the geomagnetic noise(around 0.1 nT), better sensors are required.

To measure the field below the geomagnetic noise, much more sensitive magnetic field sensors have to be employed. These sensors are mainly used in medical and biomedical applications, such as MRI and molecule tagging.|$|E

5000|$|As {{can be seen}} in the illustrations, in {{contrast}} to a coherent state, the quantum noise for a squeezed state is no longer independent of the phase of the light wave. A characteristic broadening and narrowing of the noise during one oscillation period can be observed. The probability distribution of a squeezed state is defined as the norm squared of the wave function mentioned in the last paragraph. It corresponds to the square of the electric (and magnetic) field strength of a classical light wave. The moving wave packets display an oscillatory motion combined with the widening and narrowing of their distribution: the [...] "breathing" [...] of the wave packet. For an amplitude-squeezed state, the most narrow distribution of the wave packet is reached at the <b>field</b> <b>maximum,</b> resulting in an amplitude that is defined more precisely than the one of a coherent state.
