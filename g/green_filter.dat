25|$|In {{the past}} use {{was made of}} {{searchlight}} signals; these have a single lamp in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> to show the respective aspect. The filter assembly is moved by an electro-magnet. For a double-yellow aspect a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only when required. A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving glasses inside) remain in use in the Clacton area, but the concept had a renaissance in the 2000’s {{with the advent of}} LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|E
25|$|A {{colposcope}} is used {{to identify}} visible clues suggestive of abnormal tissue. It functions as a lighted binocular or monocular microscope to magnify {{the view of the}} cervix, vagina, and vulvar surface. Low magnification (2× to 6×) may be used to obtain a general impression of the surface architecture. 8x to 25x magnification are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix. High magnification together with <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> is often used to identify certain vascular patterns that may indicate the presence of more advanced pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Acetic acid solution and iodine solution (Lugol's or Schiller's) are applied to the surface to improve visualization of abnormal areas.|$|E
25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} red filter, one with a <b>green</b> <b>filter)</b> from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a subtractive color system for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E

25|$|<b>Green</b> channel <b>filtering</b> {{is another}} {{technique}} that {{is useful in}} differentiating lesions rather than vessels. This method {{is important because it}} provides the maximal contrast between diabetic retinopathy-related lesions. Microaneurysms and hemorrhages are red lesions that appear dark after application of <b>green</b> channel <b>filtering.</b> In contrast, exudates, which appear yellow in normal image, are transformed into bright white spots after <b>green</b> <b>filtering.</b> This technique is mostly used according to the 2014 review, with appearance in 27 out of 40 published articles in the past three years. In addition, <b>green</b> channel <b>filtering</b> can be used to detect center of optic disc in conjunction with double-windowing system.|$|R

25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a <b>green</b> <b>filter,</b> and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an additive color image by {{one person at a time}} through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{also thought}} that Hawkins was the {{reasoning}} {{for the second}} episode's name. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall observed that the episode came from Michael's perspective. According to Sepinwall, [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] showed Hannah and Rex {{together for the first}} time in the flashback shortly before the crash. He opined that the only people who currently watch the series are [...] "the ones who can quickly identify the red filter from the <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> and figure things out accordingly".

2500|$|In December 1992, during Galileo second gravity-assist {{planetary}} flyby of Earth, another groundbreaking {{experiment was}} performed. Optical communications in space {{was assessed by}} detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with Galileo CCD. The experiment, dubbed Galileo Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a frequency doubled Neodymium-Yttrium-Aluminium garnet (...) laser operating at 532nm with a repetition rate of ~15 to 30Hz and a pulse power (FWHM) {{in the tens of}} megawatts range, which was coupled to a [...] Cassegrain telescope for transmission to Galileo. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger, , transmitting telescope. Long exposure (~0.1 to 0.8s) images using Galileo 560nm centered <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to [...] Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform acceleration on the spacecraft being slower than expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400ms exposure times) all contributed to the reduction of the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired will likely be used in the future to design laser [...] "downlinks" [...] which will send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme is already being studied (as of 2004) for a data link to a future Mars orbiting spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|When Turner died in 1903, his {{financial}} backer at that time, pioneering film producer Charles Urban, {{passed on the}} development of the process to George Albert Smith, who by 1906 had developed a simplified version that he later named Kinemacolor. The Kinemacolor camera had red and <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> in the apertures of its rotating shutter, so that alternating red-filtered and green-filtered views of the subject were recorded on consecutive frames of the panchromatic black-and-white film. The Kinemacolor projector did the same thing in reverse, projecting the frames of the black-and-white print alternately through the red and <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> in its rotating shutter.|$|R
50|$|The camera's sensor {{is almost}} {{invariably}} overlaid with a color filter array (CFA), usually a Bayer filter, {{consisting of a}} mosaic of a 2x2 matrix of red, green, blue and (second) <b>green</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Karl Matthes (German {{physician}} 1905-1962) {{developed the}} first 2-wavelength ear O2 saturation meter {{with red and}} <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> (later switched to red and infrared filters). His meter was the first device to measure O2 saturation.|$|R
50|$|If the {{photographer}} has an advanced understanding, they may use different colors {{in areas of}} an image to create contrast differences selectively when printing their negatives, similar to using colored filters on black and white film. It is, in effect, using a red filter only on the sky, and perhaps a <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> on just the grass, all at once (for example: the red filter would darken {{the sky and the}} <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> would lighten the grass). Mark Nelson's digital negative process covers this extensively.|$|E

50|$|Baseline {{color and}} black and white red-free {{filtered}} images are taken prior to injection. The black and white images are filtered red-free (a <b>green</b> <b>filter)</b> to increase contrast and often gives a better image of the fundus than the color image.|$|E
50|$|A {{color filter}} array is {{a mosaic of}} color filters {{in front of the}} image sensor. Commercially, the most {{commonly}} used CFA configuration is the Bayer filter illustrated here. This has alternating red (R) and <b>green</b> (G) <b>filters</b> for odd rows and alternating green (G) and blue (B) filters for even rows. There are twice as many <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> as red or blue ones, catering to the human eye's higher sensitivity to green light.|$|R

50|$|Based on {{the same}} dye-transfer {{technique}} first applied to motion pictures in 1916 by Max Handschiegl, Technicolor Process 3 (1928) was developed to eliminate the projection print made of double-cemented prints {{in favor of a}} print created by dye imbibition.

40|$|Purpose: Color vision {{deficiency}} (CVD) {{especially the}} Red-Green type (RG), affects 8 % {{of the male}} and 0. 5 % of the female population. There is no cure for color deficiency. However, there are specially-tinted lenses marketed to enhance the color contrast for CVD individuals. Recently, EnChroma Filters claim to enhance color perception. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine EnChroma Cx- 14, red, and <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> subjectively on subjects with RG CVD. Methods: Nine males and one female (aged 19 – 52 years) with RG CVD were recruited. Five were severe deutans, two moderate deutans, and two were severe protans. Subjective responses to EnChroma were tested using ColorDx software on a tablet and online Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100 -Hue tests. Error scores of the ColorDx and FM 100 Hue tests with EnChroma CX- 14, Red and <b>Green</b> <b>filters</b> were calculated and compared against Placebo (untinted glasses). Results: In only two subjects, EnChroma filters resulted in CVD improvement from severe protan to moderate protan and from severe deutan to moderate deutan using ColorDx. Neither EnChroma nor <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> improved the mean error scores of ColorDx (p = 0. 39) and (p = 1. 00), respectively. However, red filter significantly improved color discrimination from severe deutan to mild deutan in all deutan subjects, and in one subject, from severe protan to mild deutan (p = 0. 013). Similarly, EnChroma did not significantly improve the error score of FM 100 Hue test. Also, none of the other filters showed significant improvement in the error scores of the FM 100 Hue. Conclusions: EnChroma Cx- 14 filters are multi-notch filters that modify the wavelength transmission to the observer. To our knowledge this is the first study to measure the effectiveness of EnChroma Cx- 14 on digital version of Ishihara (ColorDx). Our results showed that the EnChroma filters had no significant effect on the performance of any of the CVD subjects, but improved the error score in only two subjects...|$|R
5000|$|The Coronet Twelve-20 - a {{box camera}} taking 6x6 cm format {{pictures}} on 120 film and 620 film.

50|$|Paramount {{took this}} concept a step further, using old Stein cameras from the 1930s which used a two-frame color format that was itself adopted from a 1902 three-frame color film process {{developed}} by Edward Raymond Turner. For the aborted early 1930s color process, {{instead of an}} image four perforations high, the camera exposed eight perforations (essentially two frames) consisting of one 4-perf image through a red filter and one 4-perf image through a <b>green</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, {{filters are}} used {{so that each}} dye is imaged {{separately}} (for example, a blue filter is used to image Hoechst, then rapidly switched to a <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> to image GFP).

50|$|Kinemacolor was {{the first}} {{successful}} color motion picture process, used commercially from 1908 to 1914. It was invented by George Albert Smith of Brighton, England in 1906.

5000|$|Convinced {{that there}} was no future in {{additive}} color processes, Comstock, Wescott, and Kalmus focused their attention on subtractive color processes. This culminated in what would eventually be known as Process 2 (1922) (in the later 1900s commonly called by the misnomer, [...] "two-strip Technicolor"). As before, the special Technicolor camera used a beam-splitter that simultaneously exposed two consecutive frames of a single strip of black-and-white film, one behind a <b>green</b> <b>filter</b> and one behind a red filter.|$|E
5000|$|Technicolor {{originally}} {{existed in}} a two-color (red and green) system. In Process 1 (1916), a prism beam-splitter {{behind the camera}} lens exposed two consecutive frames of a single strip of black-and-white negative film simultaneously, one behind a red filter, the other behind a <b>green</b> <b>filter.</b> Because two frames were being exposed at the same time, the film had to be photographed and projected at twice the normal speed. Exhibition required a special projector with two apertures (one with a red filter {{and the other with}} a <b>green</b> <b>filter),</b> two lenses, and an adjustable prism that aligned the two images on the screen. The results were first demonstrated to members of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in New York on February 21, 1917. [...] Technicolor itself produced the only movie made in Process 1, The Gulf Between, which had a limited tour of Eastern cities, beginning with Boston and New York in September 1917, primarily to interest motion picture producers and exhibitors in color. The near-constant need for a technician to adjust the projection alignment doomed this additive color process. Only a few frames of The Gulf Between, showing star Grace Darmond, are known to exist today.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{attempts}} to propose {{explanations for the}} century-old puzzle which thousands of physicists, including Einstein, Plank, Feynman …have been trying to resolve.

Then a small „set ‟ of waves is taken and its sum is plotted showing that at most of the places the wave-amplitudes mutually nullify each-other and constructively add only at discrete points in space and time; agreeing with our mathematical characterization. Then we show that in the experiments performed so far the red lasers had sizably wide line-width, means the sources have been producing a wide set of waves, and not just a pure single frequency. Similarly, in the single-particle interference-experiments incandescent filament-lamps were used with <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> inserted to isolate single photons; but it is obvious that at the frequencies of light very narrow-band-filters are not yet technically feasible, so the <b>green</b> <b>filters</b> used allowed sizably wide band of waves.
