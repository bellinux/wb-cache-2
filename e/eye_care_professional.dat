25|$|Pupil dilation: The <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> places {{drops into}} {{the eye to}} dilate the pupil.

5000|$|The {{human eye}} {{contains}} enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond {{the duties of}} a general practitioner. These specialists, or <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professionals,</b> serve different functions in different countries. <b>Eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professionals</b> can have overlap in their patient care privileges: both an ophthalmologist (M.D.) and optometrist (O.D.) are professionals who diagnoses eye disease and can prescribe lenses to correct vision,; but, typically, the ophthalmologist is licensed to perform surgery and perform complex procedures to correct disease: ...|$|R
50|$|Infectious {{keratitis}} can be bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal. Remarkable {{differences in}} {{presentation of the}} patient allows presumptive diagnosis by the <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional,</b> helping in institution of appropriate anti-infective therapy.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} optical powers are {{approximately}} additive enables an <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> to prescribe corrective lenses {{as a simple}} correction to the eye's optical power, rather than doing {{a detailed analysis of}} the entire optical system (the eye and the lens). Optical power {{can also be used to}} adjust a basic prescription for reading. Thus an <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional,</b> having determined that a myopic (nearsighted) person requires a basic correction of, say, −2 dioptres to restore normal distance vision, might then make a further prescription of 'add 1' for reading, to make up for lack of accommodation (ability to alter focus). This is the same as saying that −1 dioptre lenses are prescribed for reading.|$|E

50|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> (ECP) is an {{individual}} who provides a service related to the eyes or vision. It is any healthcare worker involved in eye care, from one {{with a small amount}} of post-secondary training to practitioners with a doctoral level of education.|$|E

40|$|Refractive {{error is}} a common and treatable cause of visual disability.

This study compares three field measures of refraction performed by a lay technician to a subjective refraction performed by trained <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professionals</b> in both a controlled clinical setting as well as a field trial conducted in Central America.

50|$|Optic pits {{themselves}} {{do not need}} to be treated. However, patients should follow up with their <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> annually or even sooner if the patient notices any visual loss whatsoever. Treatment of PVD or serous retinal detachment will be necessary if either develops in a patient with an optic pit.|$|E
50|$|A {{subjective}} refraction requires {{responses from}} the patient. Typically, the patient will sit behind a phoropter or wear a trial frame and look at an eye chart. The <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> will change lenses and other settings while asking the patient for feedback on which set of lenses give the best vision.|$|E

50|$|Baseline {{evaluation}} {{for patients}} beginning treatment with a chloroquine derivative {{should include a}} complete eye examination by an <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional,</b> retinal photography for follow-up comparisons, and Visual field testing with a white pattern. Central visual field assessment should test the central 10° of vision with a white test target (such as Humphrey 10-2 program).|$|E
50|$|In medicine, {{particularly}} optometry, ophthalmology and orthoptics, refraction (also {{known as}} refractometry) is a clinical test {{in which a}} phoropter may {{be used by the}} appropriate <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> to determine the eye's refractive error and the best corrective lenses to be prescribed. A series of test lenses in graded optical powers or focal lengths are presented to determine which provides the sharpest, clearest vision.|$|E
50|$|When {{observing a}} person with strabismus, the {{misalignment}} of the eyes may be quite apparent. A patient with a constant eye turn of significant magnitude {{is very easy to}} notice. However, a small magnitude or intermittent strabismus can easily be missed upon casual observation. In any case, an <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professional</b> can conduct various tests, such as cover testing, to determine {{the full extent of the}} strabismus.|$|E
50|$|Intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) is {{the fluid}} pressure inside the eye. Tonometry is the method <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> <b>professionals</b> use to determine this.
