50|$|In Killing Field by Charles Sheffield, he envisaged {{ships with}} a disk {{containing}} a flat arrangement of black holes at the nose, with a moveable crew capsule.

5000|$|Moulton {{considered}} that small wheels with high-pressure tyres {{would result in}} less rolling resistance, less inertia and hence greater acceleration. He {{then went on to}} develop a range of high-pressure tyres in cooperation with Dunlop.

[...] In this respect, the Moulton bicycle was ahead of its time, as bicycle suspension would not become common for another 30 years.|$|R

50|$|Although {{slightly}} shorter overall {{than the}} Mark 3, the fourth generation saw the wheelbase extended slightly. Some powertrain options were carried over. Nevertheless, two new internal combustion engines were offered, the 1.8-litre turbo 4-cylinder (often {{referred to as}} the 1.8 20vT), and the VR5 (a 5-cylinder derivative of the VR6 engine). The suspension setup remained much as before. However, it was softened considerably in most models to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> ride, which was met with some criticism as it was still quite hard in comparison with rivals such as vehicles offered from French car makers.|$|R
5000|$|However, the key {{improvement}} over conventional suspension {{is that the}} front/rear interconnection allows the vehicle to be stiffer in roll than in pitch. Hence {{it is possible to}} design a compliant suspension - <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> ride - without suffering a penalty in terms of excessive roll when cornering. In roll, there is no transference of fluid from the displacers, and hence its internal pressure rises. The only [...] "give" [...] in the suspension occurs because of the inherent flexibility of the rubber springs. These are naturally stiff.|$|R
50|$|No {{goals were}} {{scored in the}} first quarter, and only one behind in the last. In the third quarter, however, Fitzroy's {{superior}} pace and power allowed it to kick three goals with the wind, which <b>gave</b> it <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> winning margin.|$|R
