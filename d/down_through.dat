5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing <b>down</b> <b>through</b> a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed <b>down</b> <b>through</b> generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their marital families. Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E

50|$|The red rustyhood {{widespread}} and locally common, growing in heathy woodland and open forest, often in shallow soil in rocky places.

Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled <b>down</b> <b>through</b> the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} pleistocene, the river {{probably}} {{sprang from the}} north of the Vale of Holmesdale across the North <b>Downs</b> <b>through</b> the Merstham Gap, a wind gap. In more recent times, rainwater falling on the <b>Down</b> percolates <b>through</b> the chalk and reappears as springs in central Croydon, Beddington, and Carshalton. The occasional stream, known as the Bourne, which runs through the Caterham valley (and Smitham Bottom in Coulsdon) is a source of the River Wandle but only surfaces after heavy rainfall. A series of ditches and culverts channels the water from Purley to Croydon.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Philippe Mottu meets for {{the first}} time Frank Buchman, the Oxford Group's founder who visits Geneva with a team in order to talk to League of Nations delegates.

60|$|After {{the first}} {{paroxysm}} was over, Tommy rose up, kissed Mrs Laker on the cheek, bade her goodnight with unwonted decision of manner, {{and went straight}} to the amphibious hut of his friend Bluenose, whom he found taking a one-eyed survey of the <b>Downs</b> <b>through</b> a telescope, from mere force of habit.|$|R
5|$|Following Allen's {{death the}} estate passed <b>down</b> <b>through</b> his family. In 1828, Bishop Baines {{bought it for}} use as a Roman Catholic College.

5|$|Accounts of {{the conquest}} {{as seen from}} the point of view of the {{defeated}} highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation <b>down</b> <b>through</b> the Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619. A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility of Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066 William de Moyon was given land at Dunster, Broomfield and West Quantoxhead, his son {{becoming}} William de Mohun of Dunster, 1st Earl of Somerset, while William Malet received Enmore. East Quantoxhead {{was given to}} the Luttrells (previously spelled de Luterel), who passed the manor <b>down</b> <b>through</b> descendants into the 20th century. A Luttell also became the Earl of Carhampton and acquired Dunster Castle in 1376, holding it until it became a National Trust property in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|The A2022 is a non-primary road in England.

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains <b>down</b> <b>through</b> the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have {{found evidence of}} domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas <b>down</b> <b>through</b> Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass <b>down</b> <b>through</b> the entire magma sea. These columns are hollow {{and can be}} broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E

50|$|There is a Winterbourne {{stream in}} a {{suburban}} area of Lewes, East Sussex. The area is also called Winterbourne. The stream runs from {{the foot of the}} <b>Downs</b> <b>through</b> a park, a housing estate, a public garden and ends at the Railway Land Nature Reserve. It is a clear and verdant stream, much frequented by ducks. Another Winterbourne stream is found In Chichester, West Sussex.|$|R

5|$|From {{its source}} the river flows westwards through Birdwood and Gumeracha. It then {{continues}} <b>down</b> <b>through</b> Torrens Gorge entering suburban Adelaide at Athelstone {{with some of}} its path paralleled by the O-Bahn Busway. It passes between the city-centre and North Adelaide, forming the Torrens Lake between the Adelaide Zoo and a weir opposite Adelaide Gaol. The river then continues the remaining eight kilometres to the sea at Henley Beach South, emptying into Gulf St Vincent via a constructed outlet.|$|E
5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping <b>down</b> <b>through</b> the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|He {{took one}} touch {{to control a}} long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball <b>down</b> <b>through</b> Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs, and finally {{finished}} by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right. The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time. Bergkamp made the All-Star team of the tournament, alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.|$|E
