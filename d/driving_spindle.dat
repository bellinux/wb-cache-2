40|$|Proper {{orientation}} of the mitotic spindle is critical for successful cell division in budding yeast. To investigate the mechanism of spindle orientation, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) –tubulin fusion protein to observe microtubules in living yeast cells. GFP–tubulin is incorporated into microtubules, allowing visualization of both cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules, and does not interfere with normal microtubule function. Microtubules in yeast cells exhibit dynamic instability, although they grow and shrink more slowly than microtubules in animal cells. The dynamic properties of yeast microtubules are modulated during the cell cycle. The behavior of cytoplasmic microtubules revealed distinct interactions with the cell cortex that result in associated spindle movement and orientation. Dynein-mutant cells had defects in these cortical interactions, resulting in misoriented spindles. In addition, microtubule dynamics were altered {{in the absence of}} dynein. These results indicate that microtubules and dynein interact to produce dynamic cortical interactions, and that these interactions result in the force <b>driving</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation...|$|E
40|$|The small GTPase Ran {{regulates the}} {{interaction}} of transport receptors {{with a number of}} cellular cargo proteins. The high affinity binding of the GTP-bound form of Ran to import receptors promotes cargo release, whereas its binding to export receptors stabilizes their interaction with the cargo. This basic mechanism linked to the asymmetric distribution of the two nucleotide-bound forms of Ran between the nucleus and the cytoplasm generates a switch like mechanism controlling nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Since 1999, we have known that after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) Ran and the above transport receptors also provide a local control over the activity of factors <b>driving</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly and regulating other aspects of cell division. The identification and functional characterization of RanGTP mitotic targets is providing novel insights into mechanisms essential for cell division. Here we review our current knowledge on the RanGTP system and its regulation and we focus on the recent advances made through the characterization of its mitotic targets. We then briefly review the novel functions of the pathway that were recently described. Altogether, the RanGTP system has moonlighting functions exerting a spatial control over protein interactions that drive specific functions depending on the cellular context...|$|E
40|$|Background Bipolar spindle {{assembly}} {{is critical for}} achieving accurate segregation of chromosomes. In the absence of centrosomes, meiotic spindles achieve bipolarity {{by a combination of}} chromosome-initiated microtubule nucleation and stabilization and motor-driven organization of microtubules. Once assembled, the spindle structure is maintained on a relatively long time scale despite the high turnover of the microtubules that comprise it. To study the underlying mechanisms responsible for {{spindle assembly}} and steady-state maintenance, we used microneedle manipulation of preassembled spindles in Xenopus egg extracts. Results When two meiotic spindles were brought close enough together, they interacted, creating an interconnected microtubule structure with supernumerary poles. Without exception, the perturbed system eventually re-established bipolarity, forming a single spindle of normal shape and size. Bipolar spindle fusion was blocked when cytoplasmic dynein function was perturbed, suggesting a critical role for the motor in this process. The fusion of Eg 5 -inhibited monopoles also required dynein function but only occurred if the initial interpolar separation was less than twice the microtubule radius of a typical monopole. Conclusions Our experiments uniquely illustrate the architectural plasticity of the spindle and reveal a robust ability of the system to attain a bipolar morphology. We hypothesize that a major mechanism <b>driving</b> <b>spindle</b> fusion is dynein-mediated sliding of oppositely oriented microtubules, a novel function for the motor, and posit that this same mechanism might also be involved in normal spindle assembly and homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{segregation}} of chromosomes during cell division is accomplished through the assembly of a bipolar microtubule-based structure called the mitotic spindle.

40|$|When a cell divides, it must {{accurately}} replicate its {{genetic material}} and then faithfully segregate this material into the resulting daughter cells. My research addresses {{the latter half}} of this problem, focusing on how the cell regulates the function of the mitotic spindle, an elegant microtubule-based machine that attaches to replicated DNA and pulls it apart during mitosis. Here, I present two studies that investigate how the cell disassembles the mitotic spindle at the end of mitosis and how the cell positions the mitotic spindle prior to mitotic completion. I combined genetic analysis with live-cell fluorescence microscopy to identify the subprocesses <b>driving</b> <b>spindle</b> disassembly as well as the proteins that perform these subprocesses. Our results suggest that mechanistically distinct pathways largely governed by the anaphase-promoting complex, Aurora B kinase, and kinesin- 8 cooperate to drive spindle disassembly in budding yeast. We also describe the roles of novel disassembly factors such as the spindle protein She 1 and the 7 -protein Alternative Replication Factor C complex. Together, these pathways disengage the mitotic spindle halves, inhibit spindle microtubule growth, and promote sustained spindle microtubule depolymerization. Strikingly, combined inhibition of pairs of disassembly pathways yielded cells with hyper-stable spindle remnants, which caused dramatic defects in cell cycle progression, thus establishing that regulated and rapid spindle disassembly is crucial for cell proliferation. To better understand the mechanisms of spindle positioning, I examined how the dynein-driven spindle-positioning pathway in budding yeast is silenced. My work suggests that dynein activity is regulated through interaction with the multi-subunit dynactin complex at anaphase and identifies a new cellular factor, She 1, which controls this interaction. Dynactin is a well-known dynein activator, and, in budding yeast, the complete complex is required for dynein-dependent spindle movement. I found that localization of the dynactin complex is cell cycle-regulated, such that dynactin is recruited to astral microtubules, via interaction with dynein, primarily during anaphase. Additionally, we discovered that the protein She 1 is a cell cycle-regulated inhibitor of dynein activity. Without She 1, dynein activity extends beyond anaphase and, as a result, mis-positions the mitotic spindle. Strikingly, loss of She 1 also permits recruitment of the dynactin complex to astral microtubules throughout the cell cycle. These results suggest that in wild-type cells, She 1 restricts dynein activity to anaphase by preventing the interaction between dynein and the complete dynactin complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetochore}} (KT) is {{a complex}} structure that enables attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules (MTs). Several MT associated proteins (MAPs) contribute to the KT-MT interface and regulate the dynamics of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs). In addition, these MAPs localize to interpolar MTs and regulate spindle stability. One of these proteins is the S. cerevisiae CLASP (cytoplasmic linker associated protein) Stu 1, an essential protein that has several functions during mitosis and therefore localizes differently {{in the course of}} each cell division. The aim of this work was to investigate which domains of Stu 1 are important for its cell cycle specific localization, how this contributes to a coordinated action of Stu 1 and how localization and function of Stu 1 are regulated. Structural predictions of Stu 1 suggest the organization in six domains. The following observations were made with the focus on three of them: the TOGL 2 domain, the minimal MT-binding loop (ML) and the C-terminal loop (CL). The TOGL 2 domain solely achieves binding of αβ-tubulin and drives spindle formation Co-immunoprecipitations identified the TOGL 2 domain to be sufficient to bind free αβ-tubulin. This feature of the TOGL 2 domain is essential and solely responsible for the important role of Stu 1 in <b>driving</b> <b>spindle</b> formation. Thus, the TOGL 2 domain ensures the function of Stu 1 as a MT polymerase or rescue factor. Domain swapping experiments demonstrated that the function of the TOGL 2 domain of Stu 1 is very specific and cannot be easily taken over by another TOG domain. MT binding via the ML domain is required for efficient metaphase spindle formation, but is dispensable for midzone localization Besides the TOGL 2 domain, efficient spindle formation in metaphase additionally depends on the binding of Stu 1 to the MT lattice via the ML domain. Thereby, the CL domain specifies Stu 1 localization to the region of the MT overlap. Midzone localization of Stu 1 in anaphase, however, is independent of the ML domain and therefore must be ensured {{in a manner that is}} not based on MT binding. An interplay of the CL domain with the ML domain specifies Stu 1 ’s sequestration at unattached KTs The CL domain was found to specify Stu 1 for the sequestration at unattached KTs, most likely by inhibiting the MT binding affinity of the ML domain. Thus, the CL domain indirectly prevents spindle formation in the presence of unattached KTs. Efficient KT capture relies on unperturbed MT dynamics ensured by the Stu 1 TOGL 2 activity Capturing experiments of the CL deletion mutant revealed that Stu 1 localization to unattached KTs is not a prerequisite for efficient capturing. However, the ML domain and especially the TOGL 2 activity are mandatory in this respect. The contribution of Stu 1 to unperturbed MT dynamics seems to be more important for the capturing pro-cess than KT localization. This may involve the polymerization of capturing kMTs but also, as analyzed, the temporal regulation of KT-generated MTs. The CL domain makes kMT length dependent on the tension on the KT-MT inter-face The localization of Stu 1 to attached KTs is a prerequisite for the polymerization of kMTs. In this respect, the CL domain was found to inhibit Stu 1 ’s ability to stabilize kMTs and to make the kMT length dependent on tension on the KT-MT interface. The CL domain prevents precocious spindle formation to ensure biorientation The data showed that the CL domain facilitates bipolar attachment by ensuring unperturbed dynamics of interpolar MTs. Therefore, the CL domain seems to fine-tune the MT polymerizing activity of Stu 1 by regulating the MT affinity of the ML domain. Stu 1 phosphorylation within the CL domain contributes to Stu 1 regulation Finally, this work revealed that phosphorylation of Stu 1 contributes to the regulation of Stu 1. SILAC analyses identified 15 phosphorylation sites that mainly reside within the ML and the CL domain of Stu 1 and are putative target sites of various serine/ threonine kinases like Cdk 1, polo-like kinase, Ipl 1 and Mps 1. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that Stu 1 gets phosphorylated and dephosphorylated throughout the cell cycle suggesting a regulatory role for kinases. Consistent with that, in vitro kinase as-says identified Stu 1 N- and C-terminus as targets of Ipl 1 and Mps 1 kinases. Analyses of phosphomutants eventually suggested that phosphorylation of the CL domain con-tributes to the regulatory impact of the CL domain on the MT affinity of the ML domain. Taken together, the present study supports the theory that Stu 1, similar to other CLASP proteins acts as a local modulator for MT dynamics and stability. While the TOGL 2 domain accomplishes the essential function of tubulin incorporation in MT plus-ends, the other domains are required to regulate the localization of Stu 1 and (probably therefore) control the MT polymerizing activity. ...|$|E

40|$|Mitotic spindle {{morphogenesis}} {{depends upon}} the action of microtubules (MTs), motors and the cell cortex. Previously, we proposed that cortical- and MT-based motors acting alone can coordinate early spindle assembly in Drosophila embryos. Here, we tested this model using microscopy of living embryos to analyze spindle pole separation, cortical reorganization, and nuclear dynamics in interphase-prophase of cycles 11 - 13. We observe that actin caps remain flat as they expand and that furrows do not ingress. As centrosomes separate, they follow a linear trajectory, maintaining a constant pole-to-furrow distance while the nucleus progressively deforms along the elongating pole-pole axis. These observations are incorporated into a model in which outward forces generated by zones of active cortical dynein are balanced by inward forces produced by nuclear elasticity and during cycle 13, by Ncd, which localizes to interpolar MTs. Thus, the force-balance <b>driving</b> early <b>spindle</b> morphogenesis depends upon MT-based motors acting {{in concert with the}} cortex and nucleus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractElevation of {{intracellular}} free calcium causes egg activation by {{initiating a}} cascade of interacting signaling pathways that, in unison, act to remodel the cytoplasmic compartment and the nuclear compartment of the egg. We show here that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is tightly associated with the meiotic spindle and that 5 min after egg activation there is a transient, tight association of calmodulin (colocalized with CaM kinase II) on the meiotic spindle. These correlative observations caused us to test whether activation of CaM kinase II mediated the chromosomal transit into an anaphase configuration. We demonstrate that calcium and calmodulin, at physiological levels, along with ATP were capable of <b>driving</b> the <b>spindle</b> (with its associated CaM kinase II) into an anaphase configuration in a permeabilized egg system. The transit into anaphase was dependent {{on the presence of}} both calcium and calmodulin and occurred normally when they were present at a ratio of 4 to 1. Peptide and pharmacologic inhibitors of CaM kinase II blocked the transit into anaphase, both in the permeabilized egg system and in living eggs (inhibitors of protein kinase C did not block the transit into anaphase). Using a biochemical approach we confirm that CaM kinase II increases in activity 5 min after egg activation and that a second increase occurs 45 min after activation at the approximate time that the contractile ring of the second polar body is constricting. This corresponds to the approximate time when calmodulin and CaM kinase II colocalize at several points in the activated egg including the region containing midzone microtubules. CaM kinase II appears localized on midzone microtubules as soon as they form and may have a role in specifying the position of the contractile ring of the second polar body...|$|R

It {{has been reported that}} various actin nucleators including Formin- 2 are involved in the polarization of the spindle and in asymmetric cell division. In mammals, the formin family is comprised of 15 proteins. However, their individual roles in spindle migration and/or asymmetric division have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we employed a newly developed inhibitor for formin family proteins, small molecule inhibitor of formin homology 2 domains (SMIFH 2), to assess the functions of the formin family in mouse oocyte maturation. Treatment with SMIFH 2 during in vitro maturation of mouse oocytes inhibited maturation by decreasing cytoplasmic and cortical actin levels. In addition, treatment with SMIFH 2, especially at higher concentrations (500 μM), impaired the proper formation of meiotic spindles, indicating that formins play a role in meiotic spindle formation. Knockdown of the mDia 2 formins caused a similar decrease in oocyte maturation and abnormal spindle morphology, mimicking the phenotype of SMIFH 2 -treated cells. Collectively, these results suggested that besides Formin- 2, the other proteins of the formin, including mDia family play a role in asymmetric division and meiotic spindle formation in mammalian oocytes...|$|R

40|$|K-complexes (KCs), spindles, {{and slow}} {{oscillations}} characterize non-REM (NREM) sleep. Understanding how these large-scale cortical modulations coordinate cortical processing requires knowing {{where and how}} they are generated and spread. However, this is largely unknown, especially in humans. In this thesis, the interaction of the thalamus and cortex in giving rise to these sleep events, in particular the KC, was examined using computational modeling and a variety of recordings in humans: scalp electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECOG), and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). The overall aim to characterize how the KCs arise in the human cortex and how the thalamus may be implicated in this process is addressed in three parts. Chapter 1 presents a novel thalamocortical computational model of NREM stage 2 sleep that produces spindles as well as spontaneous and evoked KCs. Properties of the model are based on evidence outlined in the chapter from EEG, ECOG, and SEEG recordings that KCs may arise synchronously across the cortex. The model suggests the disruption of thalamic spindling via inactivation of the low-threshold Ca 2 + current (IT) as a possible mechanism for the production of synchronous KCs. Chapter 2 examines the spatial and temporal dynamics of individual KCs measured locally in the cortex using SEEG recordings. This study addresses where KCs occur, how often they occur, how large they are in amplitude, whether they co-occur across the cortex, and whether they propagate in sequential order across the cortex. Unlike a previously dominant model, this work finds that the KC can start anywhere, and then spread over a large or small cortical area, in any direction. Chapter 3 describes how the downstate differentially groups the cortical and thalamic spindle using simultaneous bipolar SEEG recordings. This study finds that the thalamus leads the cortex in the initiation of spindles, as well as <b>driving</b> individual <b>spindle</b> waves, while the downstate occurs in the cortex before the thalamus. In sum, the body of work presented here furthers our understanding of how corticothalamic mechanisms in humans give rise to stereotyped patterns of brain activity during sleep and suggests how these mechanisms may underlie the functional role of sleep in the brain...|$|R
