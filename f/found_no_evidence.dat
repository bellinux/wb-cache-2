5|$|A few {{controversial}} {{studies have}} linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a name-letter {{effect for the}} letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support such a relation.|$|E

5|$|After Ellis {{defeated}} the Reds by {{a score of}} 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had the umpire check Ellis, but <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence.</b> In his 1980 book, Ellis admitted that wearing hair curlers produced sweat on his hair, which he used to throw {{a modified version of}} a spitball.|$|E

5|$|As {{platinum}} is {{a catalyst}} {{in the manufacture}} of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study. The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest toxicity in vivo.|$|E
5|$|The GAO <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{improper}} or unlawful command influence by USAF {{leaders on}} the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support this.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} at Yangon International Airport (formerly RAF Mingaladon) in early 2013 failed to locate any of the rumoured aircraft, and the team {{reported}} that they <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that Spitfires were shipped there in crates or buried. Pat Woodward, who was an RAF pilot operating from Burma {{at the end of}} the war, reported that no such burying took place. In 2016 it was reported that the hunt was continuing.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for horn thrust injuries causing {{these forms of}} damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|Modi was {{appointed}} Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi {{was elected to}} the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.|$|E

5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{eruption}} {{was observed}} on the 25-26 November by the HMS Conway captained by Basil Hall, and involved {{the eruption of}} incandescent material. According to reports it lasted intermittently for the whole morning that day. A volcanic explosivity index of 2 has been estimated. These volcanic activities were at first assumed to {{have occurred in the}} local Andes mountains, but a geological expedition by Giacomo Bove in 1882 <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a volcano there; the field itself was accidentally discovered by geologists of SERNAGEOMIN in 1978.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, {{although there is a}} generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E

5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of sexual abuse, but {{took the opportunity to}} collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that this is}} effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times {{with the aid of}} photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E
