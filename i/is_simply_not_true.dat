It was in his youth, at the time when a man is thinking of love and publicity, of sunshine and singing birds, that he gave birth to this horror of great darkness; and the more we study the matter with any knowledge of the nature of youth, the more we shall come to the conclusion that Browning's obscurity had altogether the opposite origin to that which is usually assigned to it. He was not unintelligible because he was proud, but unintelligible because he was humble. He was not unintelligible because his thoughts were vague, but because to him they were obvious.|$|E

First we give higher-dimensional {{versions of}} well known one-dimensional results, including a characterization of entropy-preserving factor maps.

40|$|Abstract: For decades, deniers of {{the need}} to protect the {{environment}} have used the tactic of pitting the environment against the economy. However, this disingenuous tactic ignores the dependence of the human economy on the biosphere for raw materials (i. e., natural resources) and also that the present biospheric life support system has maintained conditions favorable (e. g., atmospheric gas balance) to the genus Homo for approximately 2 million years and for Homo sapiens for about 160, 000 to 200, 000 years. If this dependence were not significant, humans would become extinct and the human economy would disappear with them. Since the human economy is totally dependent upon the biosphere and humans are dependent on the biospheric life support system, why are they tolerant of the type of economic growth that damages the biosphere? The only reason that has some dubious validity is the assumption that, when a resource disappears, human ingenuity and creativity will {{be able to find a}} substitute for it. In short, deniers speculate that growth has no limits. However, in the latter part of the 20 th century, ample evidence became available that this speculation <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> In addition, persuasive evidence also substantiates that non-carbon alternative energy sources (e. g., solar, wind) would be less damaging to the environment and also be an economic stimulus.

40|$|Abstract A {{fundamental}} question of complexity theory is the direct product question. A famous example is Yao's XOR-lemma, [19]in which one assumes that some function f is hard on average for small circuits, (meaning that every circuit of some fixed size s which attempts to compute f is wrong on a non-negligible {{fraction of the}} inputs) and concludes that every circuit of size s 0 has a small advantage over guessing randomly when computing f Φ k(x 1; ΔΔΔ; xk) = f (x 1) ΦΔΔΔΦ f(xk) on independentlychosen x 1; ΔΔΔ; xk. All known proofs of this lemma, [12, 6, 8, 5] have the feature that s 0 ! s. In words, the circuit whichattempts to compute f Φ k is smaller than the circuit which attempts to compute f on a single input!This paper addresses the issue of proving strong direct product assertions, that is ones in which s 0 ss ks and is inparticular larger than s. Since {{we are unable to}} &quot;handle &quot; boolean circuits we follow a direction suggested by previousworks [13, 15] and study this question in weaker computational models such as decision trees and communication complexity games. Our first result is a counterexample which shows that strong direct product assertions <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> This holds for every &quot;reasonable &quot; model of computation. While this counterexample rules out the possibility of proving strong directproduct assertions, it seems to exploit defects in the formulation of the problem rather than show that our general intuition for strong direct product assertions is false. Nevertheless, in order to prove theorems with a strong direct product flavor wemust change the formulation of the question and either strengthen the assumption or weaken the conclusion. An example of strengthening the assumption is given in our main result in which we prove that if a function f is provedto be hard on average for c-bit communication protocols via the &quot;discrepancy method &quot; then f Φ k is exponentially harderon average for Ω (kc) -bit communication protocols. This follows by showing that disc(f Φ k) = O(disc(f)) Ω (k) which weprove using algebraic techniques inspired by [14]. The main technical step in the proof may be of independent interest an...|$|R
