The fact that the Ashes must be fought for is a further damper. I believe that if a series is drawn, then the Ashes should at least go into pawn so that no one holds them.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, US singer-songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a {{copyright}} infringement lawsuit, claiming that Beyoncé had used some lyrics and the musical hook from her song [...] "Got a Little Bit of Love for You". In 2003, Armour's former label manager had submitted a demo recordings to record labels, including Beyoncé's Columbia Records and Sean Paul's Atlantic Records. According {{to the district}} court, an Expert witness (Chair, Dept. of Music Theory & Composition, Shepherd School of Music, Rice University) determined the songs to be [...] "substantially similar" [...] (a requirement for an infringement finding). With regard to the musical hook, the Expert stated in his report, [...] "When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of C Minor (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A–B–A–B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison." [...] The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, could not hear {{the similarities between the}} two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.|$|E
2500|$|At the inter-Allied {{conference at}} Boulogne (20 October) Asquith {{supported}} Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika, although Britain {{had to agree}} to send a second British division, rather than be the only Ally not to send reinforcements. Robertson wrote to Repington (31 October 1916) “If I were not in my present position <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> I could find half a dozen different ways of rapidly winning this war. Being in the position I am and knowing what I know I find it not so easy...”.|$|E

2500|$|According to Tolkien, Lewis' {{hostility to}} Campbell was {{grounded}} in residual Anti-Catholicism from his upbringing in Northern Ireland. [...] But hatred of our church is {{after all the}} real only final foundation of the C of E — so deep laid that it remains even when all the superstructure seems removed (C.S.L. for instance reveres the Blessed Sacrament, and admires nuns!). Yet if a Lutheran is put in jail he is up in arms; but if Catholic priests are slaughtered — he disbelieves it (and <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> really thinks they asked for it). In the aftermath, Campbell joined Tolkien and Lewis at several meetings of the Inklings at The Eagle and Child where his [...] "poetry, political views, and religious perspectives caused quite a stir." ...|$|E
2500|$|L.V. Anderson of Slate {{states that}} [...] "ust as {{living in a}} world with {{abundant}} calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, <b>I</b> <b>daresay,</b> would be even bigger than Lawrence's." [...] Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist. MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight [...] "misguided". One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads: [...] "I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that [...] "he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on {{the court of public opinion}} and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate".|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain {{joined the}} Nazi Party {{and contributed to}} its publications. Its primary journal, the Völkischer Beobachter {{dedicated}} five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the [...] "gospel of the National Socialist movement." [...] In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler {{as one of the}} [...] "rare beautiful beings...a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze", whose words [...] "always come directly from the heart". Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a [...] "Vernichtungskrieg" [...] ("war of destruction") against all of Germany's enemies. Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler-whom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes-that:Because he [...] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler-his courage!...In this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements...but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him [...] "the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft". I believe...we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler...This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who sent him to us preserve him for many years as a [...] "blessing for the German Fatherland!".|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> am a {{joke about}} the parish," [...] said Boldwood, as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue, and with a miserable {{lightness}} meant to express his indifference.|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} liked that,” said Lady Barb; “but I can’t imagine.” And {{she looked at}} her husband—a look she often had—as if she vaguely wished him to do something.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye,' said Maurice, 'I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> {{can find}} some of the Arachne species there. By the bye, Claude, do you think papa would {{let me have a}} piece of plate-glass, {{eighteen}} by twenty, to cover my case of insects?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] Aynesworth answered, [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} {{that you are a}} little out of touch with your fellows just now. <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> when you were my age, you would have felt as I feel. <b>I</b> <b>daresay</b> that as the years go on, you will feel like it again." ...|$|E

'It's a bad house for a girl.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Youth has its follies, {{like every}} other stage of life," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> {{experienced}} the luxury of the sensation once, {{but it must have}} been a long time ago. Come, is that all it tells you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> should {{love her}} well enough after a bit;--that is, if she didn't break my head or comb my hair. I suppose {{there will be}} no {{objection}} to my saying that you sent me when I ask her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But I cannot {{really believe}} what Augusta says, though <b>I</b> [...] <b>daresay</b> {{it may have}} been so with Mr. Traffick. Perhaps you [...] have not been to your club, and so you have not got my [...] former letter. Or, it may be that you are ill yourself.

6000|$|... "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> am wrong," [...] Gervaise said quietly; [...] "but {{you know}} we have our spies at Constantinople, and {{probably}} the sultan has his spies here; and the idea {{occurred to me that}} perhaps this man might be one of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{have him}} next me at dinner," [...] she declared. [...] "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> shall find out {{all about him}} pretty soon. Come, Henry, I am quite sure that {{everyone}} is down. You and I play host and hostess so seldom that we have forgotten our manners." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was evidently}} useless to risk any further allusion to Mrs. Ellmother's symptoms. Miss Ladd tried another method of persuasion.

6000|$|He {{was turning}} away, {{as his own}} {{business}} was over; but the young Englishman, who had surrendered his companion, not to say his victim, to the embrace, as it might now almost be called, of their hostess, just checked him with a friendly gesture. “I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> shan’t see you again—I’m going away.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> {{can find}} you one, {{if you care}} to try it. I don't indulge myself."

6000|$|... "You {{never will}} {{understand}} me," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> {{might be more}} like other people now, if--if I had been brought up differently.

6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} nothing for it but that you should come here; and as {{you live in the}} house, and as I am sure to be here every morning, and as you have no {{possible}} occupation for your time, and as we have nothing particular to do with ours,--I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> shan't see you again before I go to my aunt's in Berkeley Square." ...|$|R
6000|$|The young officer laughed again. [...] "I <b>daresay</b> <b>I</b> can {{enlighten}} you. In {{the middle}} of the last act one of the wings collapsed, and everybody saw a big Englishman, who had apparently just kicked it over, sitting, half asleep, in a folding chair. He didn't appear to have any legitimate connection with the drama, but he brought the house down when he got up in a hurry and fell over his chair." ...|$|R
