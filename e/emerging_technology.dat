40|$|Science and {{technology}} are paramount in defining our social practices. Computers and word processors define {{the practice of}} writing books differently from how ink and paper do. Similarly, molecular analyses of blood samples characterize the practice of diagnosing diseases differently from how an oral explanation of symptoms to a doctor does. If new technologies {{have a role in}} changing social practices, then they should be politically and socially governed. The governance of <b>emerging</b> science and <b>technology</b> requires a future-oriented assessment of how currently <b>emerging</b> science and <b>technology</b> will reconfigure social practices and what type of ethical and social consequences they will have. However, assessing the extent to which <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> are desirable is a difficult task that has to deal with future oriented expectations and uncertainties. Promises and expectations of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> do not provide a stable ground for such an assessment because they are often strategic and highly uncertain. Furthermore, they do not simply describe future artifacts but they also carry some ideas of what is “good” and “desirable” for society. An assessment of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> has to balance between exploring the (un) desirable consequences of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> and avoiding speculations on improbable futures. By asking whether expectations surrounding <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> are “too good to be true” this book moves the sight of the reader from the question of assessing the “desirability” of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> to the question of assessing the “plausibility” of the expectations. Building on the tradition of Philosophy of Technology and Science and Technology Studies, this contribution justifies, explains and exemplifies an approach for assessing the plausibility of expectations. By “situating” and “thickening” expectations of two cases of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> for diagnostics, this study shows how the social and ethical consequences of <b>emerging</b> <b>technologies</b> can be explored, while avoiding ungrounded speculations...|$|R
40|$|A gulf is {{widening}} {{between the}} technologies used by students, {{those used by}} educators and those provided by institutions.
