50|$|This {{period was}} {{associated}} with a number of legislative acts, of the Russian emperors Paul I and Alexander I, which introduced restrictions on the privileged legal status of <b>foreigners</b> in Russia. Beginning with the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic wars, the Russian government became very cautious regarding <b>foreigners,</b> mainly for political reasons. This led to various constraints, particularly affecting citizens of France and the French dependent states. In the period 1789-1820, entry for <b>foreigners</b> was difficult, with special surveillance for arriving <b>foreigners.</b> Paul I ordered that <b>foreigners</b> arriving in both the capital and other areas of Russia be strictly observed. On 26 December 1796, two decrees were issued concerning the surveillance of <b>foreigners.</b> In the first decree, the Moscow authorities were given the right to expel from the city untrustworthy <b>foreigners.</b> In the second decree, local authorities were obliged to ensure monitoring of all visiting <b>foreigners,</b> paying particular attention to the French and Swiss; suspicious <b>foreigners</b> could be expelled.|$|R

5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a <b>foreigner</b> and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy <b>foreigner</b> when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
