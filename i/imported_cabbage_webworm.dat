The {{impact of}} the release of {{irradiated}} Diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L) with a dose of 200 Gy was studied in field cage experiments by releasing of irradiated and untreated DBM at a 9 : 1 ratio. Releasing male and female (F- 1) of irradiated DBM caused a considerable level of sterility in the subsequent generations. The sterility level in those respective generations were 73. 03 % and 73. 30 %,while {{the release of the}} F- 1 male only induced a level of sterility of about 55. 40 % and 56. 44 %. Inundative releases of irradiated males caused the level of sterility to reach about 44. 78 % and 68. 01 % in F- 1 and F- 2 respectively.

30|$|Cabbage {{plants were}} {{assessed}} for pest infestation {{before and after}} heading, while the wrapper leaves were monitored regularly for symptoms of pest damage. Five randomly selected plants were tagged on each plot, and visible signs of damage and occurrence of insect pest larvae were assessed and data presented as number of larvae per plant (mean[*]±[*]SD). Cabbage plants were identified as infested based on observation of diamondback moth, looper and webworm larvae or their damage, and reported as number of infested plants per treatment (mean[*]±[*]SD). Diamondback moth (P. xylostella) is an important cabbage pest with average development time of 25 – 30  days from egg to pupal stage depending on weather conditions, and a complete cycle of 17 – 51  days from egg to adult. The annual number of generations varies from four in cold climates to 12 in warm climates. Diamondback moth was assessed on wrapper leaves and identified as small round holes, scratches or skeleton damage on leaves with partially damaged epidermis that gives cabbage leaves a windowpane appearance. An adult female cabbage Looper (T. ni) moth lays from 300 to 600 eggs pale yellow and round eggs in 10 – 12  days adult lifespan that hatch in 3 – 10  days, with a more rapid pupal stage in warmer temperatures. The occurrence of webworm larvae and plant damage was identified as leaves held together with silk. Each female <b>cabbage</b> <b>webworm</b> (H. undalis) lays about 75 – 250 eggs singly or in groups of 2 – 3 on the inner tissues of host plants. The hatching larvae bore into stems of growing points, weaving webs into which they place their frass. Webworm pupates in soil within webbed cocoons that include soil particles as a generation develops in about 4 – 5  weeks at 27  °C, with short-lived adults and the potential to complete 7 – 8 generations annually.|$|R

The purpose {{of this research was}} twofold. First, this on-farm research assessed the population and activity of six beneficial arthropod predators- the carabid beetle (Carabidae: Coleoptera), minute pirate bug (Orius spp. : Hemiptera), nabid bug (Nabis spp. : Hemiptera), lady beetle larvae (family Coccinellidae: Coleoptera), syrphid fly larvae (Syrphidae: Diptera) and spiders (Araneae) - and one crop pest- the <b>imported</b> <b>cabbage</b> worm (Pieris rapae: Lepidoptera) - within a no-till Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea, gemmifera group) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) living-mulch system. Second, using two common organic insecticides-Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) and a pyrethrin/rotenone blend – this research assessed the capacity of these aforementioned predatory or parasitic arthropods to control the P. rapae population and crop damage through biological (as compared to chemical) means.

50|$|Traditionally {{known in}} the United States as the <b>imported</b> <b>cabbage</b> worm, now more {{commonly}} the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During {{the first and second}} instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow {{but the rest of the}} head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.|$|R

Following transformations and extensive plant selection, insect efficacy trials were undertaken in 2008 to 2010 in north India (Murthal near New Delhi) and south India (near Bengaluru) in large scale screen-house experiments using artificial infestations on the best performing (Elite Event) plant lines and on hybrids produced from them. Plant damage was scored {{on a scale of}} 0 (no visible damage) to 4 (plant effectively destroyed). For DBM, cabbage cluster caterpillar (Crocidolomia binotalis), <b>cabbage</b> <b>webworm</b> (Hellula undalis) and semi-looper (Trichoplusia ni) there was zero insect survival and a zero damage score on the Elite Event lines and on their hybrids, while control plants had 50 to 100 % insect survival (depending on species, life stage and trials) and damage scores of 3. 3 to 4. Cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) and common army worm (Spodoptera litura) showed some larval survival and damage scores up to 1. 4 (especially in early trials) but no survival to pupation. Screening of DBM populations worldwide (inc. 18 populations for Cry 1 B and 13 for Cry 1 C from India) showed mean LC 50 s close to that of international susceptible strains. To date F 2 screening has not identified the presence of resistance genes in DBM in the field. Cry 1 B resistance was slowly developed artificially in the laboratory but 1 C resistance and resistance to the Cry 1 B/ 1 C combination was harder to develop and had higher fitness costs. The ‘resistant’ lines showed some extended survival of stunted DBM larvae on dual gene Bt plants but no survival to pupation. There was no cross-resistance between Cry 1 B and Cry 1 C. Resistance to both genes was autosomal and recessive. Beneficial insects were demonstrated to have the potential to provide additional mortality on rare surviving insects in Bt fields. Aphids were well controlled for the first 40 days post-transplanting using imidacloprid pelleted onto seed and, if necessary, by 1 - 2 Verticillium lecanii sprays thereafter.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Relay strip-cropping {{combines}} two vegetation management tactics, under-sowing and strip-management. In {{this study}} conducted from 1994 though 1997, a cover crop seed-mixture containing oats (Avena sativa L. var. "Monida"), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multflorum Lam.), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) was broadcast over established broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) 32 days after planting. The broccoli was planted, under-sown, and harvested in sections alternated with strips of cover crop. The cover crop relay provided tillage and pesticide refuges for beneficial insects without taking land out of broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping increased the abundance {{and diversity of}} ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones: Phalangiidae), lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and damsel bugs (Heteroptera: Nabidae) in the cropping system; however, this did not always result in increased natural enemies in the broccoli. Arthropod species varied significantly in their propensity to leave the non-crop vegetation and move into the broccoli. Movement of the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata L. from the cover crop strips into the broccoli may have depressed aphid populations in 1996. The non-crop vegetation may {{have served as a}} sink rather than a source for Nabis species and appeared to reduce their density in the broccoli growing nearby. There was no evidence that background vegetation surrounding the broccoli reduced colonization by winged aphids. The density of the cabbage flea beetle Phyllotreta crucferae Goeze was lower in the broccoli relay compared with the clean-tilled broccoli. The number of third instar <b>imported</b> <b>cabbage</b> worm Pieris rapae (L.) and cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) was reduced on broccoli leaves and harvested buds in the relay strip-cropping system compared with the clean-tilled system. The number of diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) pupae was higher in the clean-tilled broccoli; percent parasitism of the pupae was similar in the two cropping systems. Although reduction in broccoli contamination associated with relay strip-cropping was significant, the residual insect contamination was unacceptable for commercial broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping may be useful for preventing soil erosion and protecting water quality. Relay strip-cropping may be a useful component of an integrated pest management program...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (B. t.) based {{formulations}} {{have been}} widely used to control lepidopteran pests in agriculture and forestry. One of their weaknesses is their short residual activity when sprayed in the field. Using Pickering emulsions, mixtures of spores and crystals from three B. t. serovars were successfully encapsulated in colloïdosomal microparticles (50 μm) using innocuous chemicals (acrylic particles, sunflower oil, iron oxide nanoparticles, ethanol and water). A pH trigger mechanism was incorporated within the particles so that B. t. release occurred only at pH > 8. 5 which corresponds to the midgut pH of the target pests. Laboratory assays performed on Trichoplusia ni (T. ni) larvae demonstrated that the microencapsulation process did not impair B. t. bioactivity. The best formulations were field-tested on three key lepidopteran pests that attack Brassica crops, i. e., the <b>imported</b> cabbageworm, the <b>cabbage</b> looper and the diamondback moth. After 12 days, the mean number of larvae was significantly lower in microencapsulated formulations than in a commercial B. t. formulation, and the effect of microencapsulated formulations was comparable to a chemical pesticide (lambda-cyhalothrin). Therefore, colloïdosomal microcapsule formulations successfully extend the bioactivity of B. t. for the management of lepidopteran pests of Brassica crops...|$|R

Although {{a number of}} major pests attack cabbage in New York, insects are the most important. Two lepidopteran larval pests that begin to attack cabbage early in the season are the diamondback moth and the <b>imported</b> cabbageworm. The <b>cabbage</b> looper, a lepidopteran migrant from the south, arrives late in the season and usually becomes an additional threat. Cabbage maggot, flea beetle, cabbage aphids, and onion thrips are other insect pests that warrant control measures. Cabbage is also sporadically infected by diseases such as black rot, black leg, downy mildew, club root, and sugar beet cyst nematode, any of which can result in substantial crop loss. Growers must protect their crop from these pests by any means available. Presently, pesticides are the most widely used and effective means of crop protection. However, total reliance upon pesticides, to the exclusion of other control tactics, can be inefficient. Strict adherence to pesticides and regular repetitive spraying may result in: increased pest resistance to pesticides; detrimental effects on non-target organisms; environmental pollution; potential hazard to the pesticide applicator, farm worker, and consumer; spiraling treatment costs; and uneconomical use of energy. Since processing cabbage (for sauerkraut) need not be cosmetically perfect, a certain amount of leaf damage by Lepidoptera or diseases is acceptable. This allows growers to treat sauerkraut cabbage less often than fresh market cabbage (approximately 4 vs 8 sprays/field/season, respectively). Since the return per acre of processed cabbage is considerably less than that of fresh market cabbage ($ 736 and $ 3, 500, respectively), sauerkraut growers must be more economical in their crop protection practices...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the operation and}} results of a vegetable market information and consultation system (MICS), set up between 2002 and 2005 in Hanoi, to address marketing problems faced by vegetable farmers. A MICS is a market information system (MIS) combined with debates organised among farmers, traders, and development agents to reach common visions and strategies on marketing. Information collected {{in the first years}} relating to indicators of origin and supply deficits was disseminated to farmers and extension agents through newsletters and consultation meetings. The process then focused on making daily prices available, as requested by the farmers. The system was based on a network of contact traders and dissemination was by television. The workshops made it possible to reach a consensus for market opportunities arising from periods of supply deficit for some vegetables and how {{to take advantage of this}} situation, especially for tomatoes and <b>cabbage</b> <b>imported</b> from China during the rainy season, which presented some quality differences compared to the local products. With regards to price information, the majority of farmers and traders, surveyed by a quick-impact appraisal, stated they had access through television on a regular basis and that they used price information mostly to bargain with traders. Back up for a permanent ''safe'' vegetable producer and trader association was one of the outputs of the MICS. Our experience shows that price dissemination was easier to sustain (with the involvement of the public sector) than the consultation workshops, generally due to low local capacity in terms of meeting facilitation and the present weakness of extension services and sector organisations.
