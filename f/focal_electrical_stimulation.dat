Another member of the lab observed that electrical stimulation reduced, rather than enhanced pain experience, which inspired Akil and fellow graduate student, David Mayer, to continue to research this phenomenon, which they later referred to as “stimulation produced analgesia" [...] (SPA). Working on rats, they found that stimulation at several mesencephalic and diencephalic sites eradicated responsiveness to painful stimuli and left other sensory modes relatively unaffected. This idea of SPA became the topic of Akil’s Ph.D. dissertation. Further research in this area was conducted in the rat by employing the D'Amour and Smith tail flick test in order to investigate role played by the cerebral monoamines, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Akil and colleagues used four different approaches to alter transmission in monoamine pathways: depletion of monoamine stores, replacement of depleted monoamine stores, potentiation of monamine systems, and blockade of catecholamine receptors; the four approaches produced internally consistent results.

Certain pretectal thalamic neurons, type TH3, showed a preference for big moving objects and the anti-worm configuration of moving bar stimuli. It is suggested that the selectivity of tectal prey feature detectors, type T5.2, is determined by inhibitory influences of pretectal anti-worm detectors of the type TH3. Pretectal lesions impaired the prey-selectivity.|$|E

TFS current was gradually increased by 20 % starting at 103 µA allowing us to assess the relationship between TFS current and both potentials recorded from the bipolar electrode and the resulting electric field. Generally, increases in TFS current resulted in increases in the electric field. This allows us to estimate what extra-cranial TFS current would be sufficient to cause the activation of neurons in the hippocampus. I...|$|R

40|$|In the {{ascending}} auditory pathway, {{the inferior}} colliculus (IC) receives and integrates excitatory and inhibitory inputs from many lower auditory nuclei, intrinsic projections within the IC, contralateral IC through the commissure of the IC {{and from the}} auditory cortex. All these connections make the IC a major center for subcortical temporal and spectral integration of auditory information. In this study, we examine bilateral collicular interaction in modulating amplitude-domain signal processing using electrophysiological recording, acoustic and <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation.</b> <b>Focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of one (ipsilateral) IC produces widespread inhibition (61. 6 %) and focused facilitation (9. 1 %) of responses of neurons in the other (contralateral) IC, while 29. 3 % of the neurons were not affected. Bilateral collicular interaction produces {{a decrease in the}} response magnitude and an increase in the response latency of inhibited IC neurons but produces opposite effects on the response of facilitated IC neurons. These two groups of neurons are not separately located and are tonotopically organized within the IC. The modulation effect is most effective at low sound level and is dependent upon the interval between the acoustic and electric stimuli. The <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the ipsilateral IC compresses or expands the rate-level functions of contralateral IC neurons. The <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> also produces a shift in the minimum threshold and dynamic range of contralateral IC neurons for as long as 150 minutes. The degree of bilateral collicular interaction is dependent upon the difference in the best frequency between the electrically stimulated IC neurons and modulated IC neurons. These data suggest that bilateral collicular interaction mainly changes the ratio between excitation and inhibition during signal processing so as to sharpen the amplitude sensitivity of IC neurons. Bilateral interaction may be also involved in acoustic-experience-dependent plasticity in the IC. Three possible neural pathways underlying the bilateral collicular interaction are discussed...|$|E

We have been developing a noninvasive transcranial <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> with our novel tripolar concentric ring electrodes as an alternative/comple-mentary therapy for seizure control. In this study we demonstrate the effect of focal stimulation on behavioral seizure activity in-duced by two successive pentylenetetrazole administrations in rats. Seizure onset latency, {{time of the first}} behavioral change, duration of seizure, and maximal seizure severity score were studied and compared for focal stimulation treated (n = 9) and control groups (n = 10). First, we demonstrate that no significant difference was found in behavioral activity for focal stimulation treated and control groups after the first pentylenetetrazole ad-ministration. Next, comparing first and second pentylenetetrazole administrations, we demonstrate there was a significant change in behavioral activity (time of the first behavioral change) in both groups that was not related to focal stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate focal stimulation provoking a significant change in seizure onset latency, duration of seizure, and maximal seizure severity score. We believe that these results, combined with our previous reports, suggest that transcranial focal stimulation may have an anticonvulsant effect.

However, the underlying mecha-nisms are debated. Here, we focus on dynamical aspects of the problem hypothesizing the existence of a bistability-powered mechanism for regenerative pulse transmission along the endothelium. Bistability implies that the cell can have two different sta-ble resting potentials and can switch between those states following an appropriate stimulus. Bistability is possible if the current–voltage curve is N shaped instead of monotonically increasing. Specifically, the presence of an inwardly rectifying potas-sium current may provide the endothelial cell with such properties. We provide a theoretical analysis as well as numerical simulations of both single- and multiunit bistable systems mimicking endothelial cells to investigate the self-consistence and stability of the proposed mechanism.

This study investigates early electrophysiological {{changes in}} distal colon of wild-type and receptor deficient mice after an inflammatory insult set by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). Colitis was induced by DNBS in CB 1 (-/-) mice, TRPV 1 (-/-) mice, {{and their respective}} wild-type littermates. Electrophysiological properties consisting of membrane potentials and electrically induced inhibitory junction potentials (IJP) of circular smooth muscle cells were evaluated at different time points. Additionally a histological colitis severity score was evaluated in CB 1 (+/+) and CB 1 (-/-) mice 24 h after DNBS. Inflammation caused spontaneous atropine insensitive rhythmic action potentials in CB 1 (-/-) and TRPV 1 (-/-) mice but not in wild-type animals. This indicates that membrane stability is disturbed, which in turn indicates a lack of protective mechanisms. <b>Focal</b> <b>electrical</b> neuronal <b>stimulation</b> of the myenteric plexus induced IJP in the smooth muscle cells.

40|$|Abstract: Dystonia is a {{movement}} disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions producing twisting, repetitive, and patterned movements or abnormal postures. Dystonia {{is among the most}} commonly observed movement disorders in clinical practice both in adults and children. It is classified on the basis of etiology, age at onset of symptoms, and distribution of affected body regions. Etiology: The etiology of pediatric dystonia is quite heterogeneous. There are many different genetic syndromes and several causes of symptomatic syndromes. Dystonia can be secondary to virtually any pathological process that affects the motor system, and particularly the basal ganglia. Classification: The etiological classification distinguishes primary dystonia with no identifiable exogenous cause or evidence of neurodegeneration and secondary syndromes. Treatment: Treatment for most forms of dystonia is symptomatic and includes drugs (systemic or focal treatments, such as botulinum toxin) and surgical procedures. There are several medications including anticholinergic, dopamine-blocking and depleting agents, baclofen, and benzodiazepines. In patients with dopamine synthesis defects L-dopa treatment may be very useful. Botulinum toxin treatment may be helpful in controlling the most disabling symptoms of segmental or <b>focal</b> dystonia.

40|$|Tinnitus is a {{distressing}} symptom {{that affects}} up to 15 % {{of the population}} for whom no satisfactory treatment exists. The authors present a novel surgical approach {{for the treatment of}} intractable tinnitus, based on cortical stimulation of the auditory cortex. Tinnitus can be considered an auditory phantom phenomenon similar to deafferentation pain, which is observed in the somatosensory system. Tinnitus is accompanied by a change in the tonotopic map of the auditory cortex. Furthermore, there is a highly positive association between the subjective intensity of the tinnitus and the amount of shift in tinnitus frequency in the auditory cortex, that is, the amount of cortical reorganization. This cortical reorganization can be demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of activating or deactivating focal areas of the human brain. Linked to a navigation system that is guided by fMR images of the auditory system, TMS can suppress areas of cortical plasticity. If it is successful in suppressing a patient's tinnitus, this focal and temporary effect can be perpetualized by implanting a cortical electrode. A neuronavigation-based auditory fMR imaging-guided TMS session was performed in a patient who suffered from tinnitus due to a cochlear nerve lesion. Complete suppression of the tinnitus was obtained. At a later time an extradural electrode was implanted with the guidance of auditory fMR imaging navigation. Postoperatively, the patient's tinnitus disappeared and remains absent 10 months later. <b>Focal</b> extradural <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the primary auditory cortex at the area of cortical plasticity is capable of suppressing contralateral tinnitus completely.

Moreover, combining <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> with high-load isometric contraction enhanced this effect. In <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> without loading, inhibition of the overexpression of calpain 1, calpain 2, and MuRF- 1 mRNA was confirmed. On the other hand, in <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> with high-load isometric contraction, inhibition of the overexpression of cathepsin L and atrogin- 1 mRNA in addition to calpain 1, calpain 2, and MuRF- 1 mRNA was confirmed. These {{findings suggest that the}} combination of <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> and high-load isometric contraction is effective as a countermeasure against muscle atrophy...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{imprinting}} a new stimulus-response (SR) relationship into a neuronal network cultured on a multi electrode array (MEA). We have used the Conditional Repetitive Stimulation (CRS) algorithm introduced by Shahaf et al in 2004. In this algorithm <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> is delivered {{at a low rate}} (< 1 Hz) and is withdrawn when a desired response is observed. We confirmed that CRS could train the network to strengthen an initially weak SR relationship. With the acquisition of a new SR relationship, we studied its effect on network activity. Specifically, spontaneously occurring network bursts measured before, during and after training were analyzed. The total firing rate within bursts was estimated with a temporal resolution of milliseconds (burst profiles). We have shown earlier that these profiles change shape on a time base of several hours during spontaneous development. We show that the rate of change of the profiles during training (i. e. CRS) was higher than when no stimulation was applied...|$|E
40|$|Neocortical {{areas are}} {{organized}} in columns, which form the basic structural and functional modules of intracortical information processing. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging and simultaneous multi-channel extracellular recordings in the barrel cortex of newborn rats in vivo, {{we found that}} spontaneously occurring and whisker stimulation-induced gamma bursts followed by longer lasting spindle bursts were topographically organized in functional cortical columns already at the day of birth. Gamma bursts synchronized a cortical network of 300 - 400 µm in diameter and were coherent with gamma activity recorded simultaneously in the thalamic ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus. Cortical gamma bursts could be elicited by <b>focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the VPM. Whisker stimulation-induced spindle and gamma bursts {{and the majority of}} spontaneously occurring events were profoundly reduced by the local inactivation of the VPM, indicating that the thalamus is important to generate these activity patterns. Furthermore, inactivation of the barrel cortex with lidocaine reduced the gamma activity in the thalamus, suggesting that a cortico-thalamic feedback loop modulates this early thalamic network activit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectrical brain {{stimulation}} {{can provide}} important {{information about the}} functional organization of the human visual cortex. Here we report the visual phenomena evoked by a large number (562) of intra-cerebral electrical stimulations performed at low-intensity with depth electrodes implanted in the occipito-parieto-temporal cortex of 22 epileptic patients. <b>Focal</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> evoked primarily visual hallucinations with various complexities: simple (spot or blob), intermediary (geometric forms) or complex meaningful shapes (faces); visual illusions and impairments of visual recognition were more rarely observed. With {{the exception of the}} most posterior cortical sites, the probability of evoking a visual phenomenon was significantly higher in the right than the left hemisphere. Intermediary and complex hallucinations, illusions and visual recognition impairment were almost exclusively evoked by stimulation in the right hemisphere. The probability of evoking a visual phenomenon decreased substantially from the occipital pole to the most anterior sites of the temporal lobe, and this decrease was more pronounced in the left hemisphere. The greater sensitivity of the right occipito-parieto-temporal regions to intra-cerebral electrical stimulation to evoke visual phenomena supports a predominant role of right hemispheric visual areas from perception to recognition of visual forms, regardless of visuo-spatial and attentional factors...|$|E
