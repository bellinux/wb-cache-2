5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court hearing {{took place}} on 11 February 2008 – only {{two days before the}} series was due to premiere. The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP {{subpoena}} to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes, as well as outlines and story lines, to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10am on that date. The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes, saying they were incomplete and that the network's lawyers were closely supervising production. However, it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously. The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer. At the hearing, which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court, Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24hours to view the series and return to court the following day to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial. Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed. The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria, but the offer was rejected by Justice King. It was initially planned that an alternative program, Underbelly: A Special Announcement, discussing {{the subject matter of the}} series, would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere. This idea was scrapped, and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead. The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision, and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options.|$|E

25|$|The Hutchinson Building {{was built}} in 1954 and was named after the hospital's late superintendent. Construction started in 1949, but was brought to a halt when the entire {{foundation}} slid down the hill, creating a landslide {{much like the one}} that occurred in 2006. The construction site was moved to a different location and the building's design had to be altered to prevent further sliding. This building contained the intensive care unit, x-ray facilities, a small cafeteria, barber shop, isolation units, physical therapy areas, and observation rooms, and instrument sterilization equipment. Each floor had patient rooms on the ends of the building surrounding a nurses pod, all separated by half-glass walls so the nurses could easily observe all of the patients. Also in this building were the morgue, laboratory, and autopsy unit. Prior to the demolition of Dixmont, the building was assessed to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> could be reused like the Cammarata Building. However, poor drainage had completely flooded the basement and renovation costs were figured to be greater than the value of the building itself, so it was demolished.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, {{with the}} party {{increasingly}} divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not sorry to see him go: the Republic, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: [...] "If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions." [...] When in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. [...] After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the Tribune as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the Tribune reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through {{the years of the}} Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle.

500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E
