5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the <b>double-blinding</b> when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

The articles were all affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences(TUMS) and indexed in PubMed by {{the end of the year}} 2010. Results: Among the subject areas, most randomized controlled clinical trials(44 cases or 14 %) were conducted in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In terms of intervention type, the majority of the studied trials(214 cases or 68. 2 %) used drug intervention. And regarding the type of blinding, <b>double-blinding</b> was employed more than other blinding techniques(152 cases or 48. 4 %). On the whole, 125 cases(39. 8 %) of randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted through drug intervention simultaneous with <b>double-blinding</b> technique.
