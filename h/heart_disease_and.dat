5|$|Ashley-Cooper {{was educated}} at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. As a child, his primary pursuits outside of getting an education, {{included}} mountain climbing and skiing. He also expressed {{a love of}} music, which continued into adulthood with his service {{as chairman of the}} London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1966 to 1980. On 8 March 1947, his father died unexpectedly of a <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> Ashley-Cooper became heir to the titles held by his grandfather and acquired the courtesy title of Lord Ashley.|$|E
5|$|Around 1934, {{he began}} working as a {{lecturer}} in economics at the City of London College. Upon his retirement from the university in 1958, Aaronson was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, in recognition of more than twenty-five years of service. The same year he moved with his family from London to Harpenden in Hertfordshire, where he later died from coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> heart failure on 9 December 1966, {{at the age of}} 71. He was buried in the Westfield Road Cemetery in Harpenden. His wife and young son survived him.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 National Institute of Statistics census, El Hatillo Municipality had 54,225 inhabitants, but {{demographics}} show {{a rapidly}} rising population. With the progressive demographic increase, El Hatillo's population {{is no longer}} exclusive to any particular ethnic group. In 2001 there were 997 births in El Hatillo, equivalent to a rate of 18.4 births per one thousand citizens. The death rate for that same year was 2.9 per one thousand citizens. 2001 data shows {{that there is an}} average of 21.3 years of potential life lost. The main cause of death according to 1999 data was cancer, followed by <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> murder.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

5|$|McConnell {{was raised}} in Colorado and after {{studying}} chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at the University of Colorado Denver, graduating in 1925. She specialized {{in the fields of}} toxicology and forensic pathology, which led her to testify in many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver's city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD. Full-time care is {{required}} in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide {{is the cause of}} death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Robinson did {{not long}} outlive his son. Complications from <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> {{diabetes}} weakened Robinson {{and made him}} almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, nine days after his appearance at the World Series, Robinson {{died of a heart}} attack at his home on 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old. Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church adjacent to Grant's Tomb in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners. Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he was buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum. Twenty-five years after Robinson's death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson's gravesite.|$|E
