40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} and {{hydraulic}} characteristics of corrugated fluid channels of compact brazed {{plate heat exchangers}} (BPHE) are investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the commercial CFD software ANSYS CFX 14. 0. The influence of geometry parameters of the corrugated pattern such as chevron angle and corrugation pitch on the BPHE performance is investigated on small <b>fluid</b> <b>section</b> geometries. The influence of various types of wall heat transfer boundary conditions on the simulation results is also studied. An entire fluid channel is simulated using various turbulence models in the Reynolds number range of 300 to 3000. The CFD predictions are also validated using data obtained from laboratory experiments. The simulations of the entire fluid channel underpredict heat transfer and pressure drop by 20 - 30 % and 10 - 35 %, respectively. The results from the small fluid sections suggest that the CFD simulations {{can be used as}} a reasonably effective tool in determining the relative performance variation of various plate patterns...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a synthetic jet actuator powered by an Enhanced Displacement (ED) motor based on piezoceramic bimorph beam operating in a post-buckled state. The motor is modeled using Lagrange's equations to capture the post-buckling beam dynamics and the dynamics of supporting elements of the motor. The <b>fluid</b> <b>section</b> of the actuator, including the air pressure and velocity within chamber, is modeled by a three-state adiabatic flow model. The motor and fluid models are coupled together to form a complete synthetic jet actuator model. An ED motor was fabricated and tested and shows that it produces eight times the energy compared to the same bimorph operated without a buckling load. Motor and model data agree well for both static and dynamic operation. The ED motor was installed in a synthetic jet actuator and demonstrated the ability to produce flows in excess of 15 m/sec with duty cycles varying between 2 Hz and 30 Hz. For these tests the drive signal used was a square wave and jet velocity was only mildly dependent of actuation frequency...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of some inhibitors on both the {{activities}} of ATPases isolated from Locusta Malpighian tubules microsomal preparations and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid production has been carried out. Inhibitors investigated included ouabain, vanadate, furosemide, acetazolamide, SITS and SCN(^_). It was important to establish the effects of temperature and[K(^+) ] on the inhibitory action of both ouabain and vanadate. Ouabaindid not significantly inhibit either Na(^+), K(^+) -ATPase or in vitro Malpighian fluid production at temperatures below 30 C. In contrast vanadate was negatively influenced by temperature. Vanadate was most effective at temperatures between 20 and 30 C. High [K]+ +enhanced vanadate but antagonised ouabain inhibition of Na, K -ATPase. Under optimal conditions ouabain inhibited both Na(^+), K(+) -ATPase (pI(_ 50) = 6. 8) and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid production (piso = 4. 3). Similarly vanadate inhibited Na*, K*-ATPase (pI(_ 50) = 5. 8) and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid secretion (pI(_ 50) = 4. 8). Vanadate was found to be nonspecific as it also inhibited both Mg(^ 2 +),-ATPase and Mg(^ 2 +), HCO(^-) (_ 3) -ATPase activities. With the exception of SITS, all other inhibitors studied inhibited in vitro Malpighian tubule <b>fluid</b> <b>section.</b> However, SITS was found to be a strong inhibitor of Mg(^ 2 +), HCO(^-) (_ 3) -ATPase. All results are discussed with reference to the role of ATPases in the process of ion and water transport across the Malpighian tubules. Cytochemical and biochemical studies based on ERNST (1972 a,b) technique were carried out as the first attempt to localise Na(^+),K(^+) -ATPase in Locusta Malpighian tubule cells. K(^+) -NPPase was localised mainly along the cytoplasmic side of the basal cell membrane in foldings but was inconsistently inhibited by ouabain. Biochemical studies showed that paraformaldehyde fixation of the Malpighian tubules and inclusion of 20 mM Sr C 1 (_ 2) in the standard incubation medium reduced the total NPPase activity by 73 %. Use of β-glycerophosphate indicated that the reaction product observed {{in the present study was}} not due to nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity. However, the results were inconclusive and led to further questioning of the validity of ERNST (1972 b) procedure in localisation of Na(^+),K(^+) -ATPase in insect epithelia...|$|E

Death losses were low (approximately 6 %), but weight gain ceased for 2 weeks. Large numbers of rotavirus (reo-like) particles were seen by electron microscopy in diarrhetic <b>fluids.</b> <b>Sections</b> of intestines showed a loss of adsorptive surface in that villi were shortened and fused with adjacent villi. Immunofluorescence revealed rotaviral antigens within damaged enterocytes. Rotavirus-containing gut fluid was harvested from sick, weaned piglets. This fluid, filtered free of bacteria, was used to inoculate per os colostrum-deprived piglets. These infected piglets developed diarrhea and dehydration, and large numbers of rotaviral particles were seen in their diarrhetic fluid. Also, rotaviral antigens were present in aberrant enterocytes, and the intestinal villi were shortened. Since the weaned piglets (3 weeks old) came from sows that were providing their piglet's intestine with passive antibody protection via milk, we concluded that the abrupt removal of the piglet from the gut-bathing antibody combined with the stress of weaning produced a neonate vulnerable to the ubiquitous rotavirus.

During pregnancy the glands proliferate on the third day after mating in response to the high levels of oestrogen secreted during pro-oestrus (Finn & Martin, 1967, 1973).

However histological sections, especially after staining with the periodic acid-Schiff's (PAS) technique, reveal clearly the presence of a mucopolysaccharide substance in the lumina of the glands so that an approximate subjective assessment of secretion can be made.

Such methods {{play a vital role}} in development of heat exchanger selection software and during geometry parameter estimation in the new product development process. The suitability of employing commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for estimating single phase thermal and hydraulic performance is investigated. Parametric studies are conducted on geometries of single phase <b>fluid</b> <b>sections</b> to isolate and quantify the influence of individual geometric parameters. The influence of mesh characteristics, choice of boundary conditions and turbulent flow modeling on the accuracy of the thermal and hydraulic predictions is presented. Benefits of simulation of fluid flow in entire channels and characteristics of channel flow for different geometric patterns are also presented. A computationally light, general, robust and continuous rating calculation method is developed for implementation in BPHE selection software. The pressure-enthalpy based method provides a generic rating core for various types of applications and provides extensive post processing information of the heat transfer process. General single phase thermal and hydraulic empirical correlations are developed as functions of plate geometric parameters. For facilitating better integration of the developed calculation method with other refrigeration system simulation software, first or higher order continuity is maintained in the sub-routines used for calculating local heat transfer coefficients and refrigerant properties. A new finite grid interpolation method is developed for fast and accurate retrieval of refrigerant properties. The developed method is currently implemented in SSPG 7 (BPHE selection software of SWEP International AB) for supporting transcritical CO 2 calculations and cascaded heat exchanger calculations.
