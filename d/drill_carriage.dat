40|$|AbstractIt is {{hard for}} geodrilling equipment, {{materials}} and personnel to enter the marsh and shoal areas, and the drilling equipment is hard to be installed and fixed for drilling, sampling and construction. According to the landform characteristics of the marsh and shoal areas, a GLX- 50 <b>drill</b> <b>carriage</b> used in marsh and shoal areas was designed and trail-produced in this paper. And the structural features, technical parameters and field production test conditions of the GLX- 50 <b>drill</b> <b>carriage</b> were introduced in detail. The development of GLX- 50 <b>drill</b> <b>carriage</b> is of great practical significance to improve the technology level of geological survey and sampling work and exploration in the remote swamp and intertidal zone where it {{is hard for}} equipment and material to enter in our country...|$|E

50|$|A {{drilling}} jumbo consists of one, {{two or three}} rock <b>drill</b> <b>carriages,</b> sometimes a platform, which the miner stands on to load the holes with explosives, clear {{the face of the}} tunnel or else. The carriages are bolted onto the chassis, which supports also the miners cabin and of course the engine. Modern {{drilling jumbo}}s are relatively large, there are however smaller ones for use in cramped conditions. Whereas modern jumbos usually fitted with rubber tyres and diesel powered, there are also exist variants with steel wheels, to ride on rails and even single carriaged sled-mounted ones. Electric power is also common, historical jumbos were powered by compressed air. Electricity and compressed air produce of course no exhaust gases, which is preferable if work is done in smaller tunnels where good ventilation is difficult.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} of this thesis was to examine work in mines. Specifically, part # 1 performed in-situ time/motion analyses of common mining jobs and part # 2 analyzed in-situ energy expenditures while working in a mine. Methodology. Part # 1 - task and sub-task duration and subjective work intensity were investigated for thirty eight subjects from six different mining jobs. These jobs were then organized into 4 groups for statistical analysis based on precedence: Group 1 (Bolting & Screening (attaching steel mesh to walls and ceiling), Group 2 (Conventional Mining (using a hand-held <b>drilling</b> <b>carriage</b> to <b>drills</b> holes in rock walls and ceiling)), Group 3 (Support Services (mechanic, welder, pipe layer)), Group 4 (Production Drill (using a machine mounted drilling unit), Scooptram(TM) (ore transport with no air conditioner), Shotcrete (concrete applied by spraying)). Part # 2 - In-situ metabolic energy expenditures were estimated through indirect open circuit calorimetry and deep tissue and skin temperatures were measured for those same groups. Results. Part # 1 - twenty three common mining tasks were identified with differences identified between various group for time and intensity. Part # 2 - metabolic requirements between groups were similar with one difference identified between groups 3 and 4 (P < 0. 05). Deep tissue and skin temperatures did not change significantly {{through the course of}} a work day. Conclusion. Part # 1 - a variety of tasks is performed by each group and there is no uniform work protocol. Part # 2 - each mining group's metabolic energy expenditure requirements to perform various mining tasks are similar...|$|R
