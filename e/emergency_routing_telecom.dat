40|$|Abstract: Accomplishing an {{effective}} <b>routing</b> of <b>emergency</b> vehicle will minimize its response time and will thus improve the response performance. Traffic congestion {{is a critical}} problem in urban area that influences the travel time of vehicles. The {{aim of this study}} is developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for <b>emergency</b> vehicle <b>routing.</b> The proposed system is based on integration of geospatial information system (GIS) and real-time traffic conditions. In this system dynamic shortest path is used for <b>emergency</b> vehicle <b>routing.</b> This study investigates the dynamic shortest path algorithms and offers an applicable solution for <b>emergency</b> <b>routing.</b> The shortest path applied is based on Dijkstra algorithm in which specific rules have been used to intelligently update the proposed path during driving. Results of this study, illustrate that dynamic vehicle routing is an efficient solution for reduction of travel time in <b>emergency</b> <b>routing.</b> Finally, it is shown that using GIS in <b>emergency</b> <b>routing</b> offers a powerful capability for network analysis, visualization and management of urban traffic network. Spatial analysis capabilities of GIS are used to find the shortest or fastest route through a network. These capabilities of GIS for analyzing spatial networks enable them to be used as decision support systems (DSSs) for dispatching and <b>routing</b> of <b>emergency</b> vehicles.
