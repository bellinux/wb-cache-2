5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E
5|$|Public school {{instruction}} in music in Baltimore began in 1843. Prior to that, itinerant and professional singing masters were the dominant form of formal {{music education in}} the state. Music <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Symphony Orchestra sometimes have programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars and other programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of music into Baltimore {{public schools in}} 1843 caused a slow decline in the popularity of private youth singing instruction. In response to the growing demand for printed music in schools, publishers began offering collections with evangelical tunes, directed at rural schools. Formal, adult musical <b>institutions,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Haydn Society and the Euterpe Musical Association, grew in popularity following the Civil War.|$|E

The collection at Emory University includes the correspondence between the Thurmans and Mrs. Bailey, their personal libraries, and nearly one thousand photographs.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Force Publique to function {{from day to}} day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{education}} system was {{enhanced by the}} establishment of the University of Mysore in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of Mysore State, Mysore University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of Mysore. Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later grew up to universities. Owing to rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: Mysore Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.|$|E
