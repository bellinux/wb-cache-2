40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{theoretical}} model where formal and <b>informal</b> <b>sectors</b> co-exist in tandem. Trade union segregates some labor from being formal. Capital is not allowed to freely move between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>sectors.</b> Using this sort of framework {{it has been shown that}} immigration of unskilled workers re-duces the return to informal labor and makes the informal good relatively cheap. A tariff slash also impinges on similar kind of results. In both the cases informal capitalists gain. Moreover, what is more striking is that both migration and tariff reform are equally bad for the economy as a whole since these policies enhance the ‘unproductive’ element or labor in the society which is really costly as these laborers could have been used to produce some more consumable commodities...|$|R

40|$|This paper makes a {{pioneering}} {{attempt to provide}} a theory of determination of interest rate in the informal credit market in a less developed economy {{in terms of a}} three-sector static deterministic general equilibrium model. There are two <b>informal</b> <b>sectors</b> which obtain production loans from a monopolistic moneylender and employ labour from the informal labour market. On the other hand, the formal sector employs labour at an institutionally fixed wage rate and takes loans from the competitive formal credit market. We show that an inflow of foreign capital and/or an emigration of labour raises (lowers) the informal (formal) interest rate but lowers the competitive wage rate in the informal labour market when the <b>informal</b> manufacturing <b>sector</b> is more capital-intensive vis-à-vis the <b>informal</b> agricultural <b>sector.</b> International factor mobility, therefore, raises the degrees of distortions in both the factor markets in this case. ...|$|R
