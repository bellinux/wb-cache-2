But if you really analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{themes were}} more general. [...] "Lady Killer" [...] {{has been cited}} as having a {{considerable}} thrash metal influence, and its topic of revenge against a serial killer is comparable to songs such as Iron Maiden's [...] "Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Judas Priest's [...] "The Ripper". The song emerged when the band attempted to [...] "write a theme song for Jack the Ripper," [...] according to Heppner, and its distinctive intro was created by generating feedback on a 1976 Gibson SG run through a 1970s MXR rack flanger. [...] "The Gem" [...] portrays the apocalypse as being {{a good thing because}} it wipes humanity off the planet; whoever sets it in motion (Heppner explained as by [...] "open Pandora's Box") is hailed as a hero for having <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] "Communicating Via-Eyes" [...] is [...] "the werewolf song", as Heppner put it; he wrote much of that song while on tour with Megadeth in the UK. He later stated a song loosely inspired by An American Werewolf in London was written for the album, {{but it is not clear}} whether he was referring to a song already on the album or an outtake from it.|$|E

500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E
500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I knew we had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] I knew it was a hit the second I heard it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, the Navy and {{the state}} of Hawaii {{announced}} that they had reached a settlement on the damage caused by the grounding. The Navy agreed to pay Hawaii $8.5 million. The amount was in addition to the $6.5 million already spent by the Navy in efforts to repair the reef. [...] "This settlement agreement recognizes the State of Hawaii's loss of a natural resource and takes into account the U.S. Navy's unprecedented efforts to restore the reef where USS Port Royal ran aground," [...] said Rear Admiral Timothy Giardina, U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy commander. In response, William J. Aila, State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources interim chairperson, stated, [...] "We believe the Navy has <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> by acknowledging its responsibility, working cooperatively with the state to restore the reef, and completing a settlement that will provide funding for protection of the state's marine resources." ...|$|E
2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{abuse that}} is suspected, not {{necessarily}} proven, requires reporting to child protection agencies, {{such as the}} Child Protection Services in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as primary care providers and nurses, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child {{that he or she}} has <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. Dolls are sometimes used to help explain what happened. For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.|$|E
2500|$|May later blamed {{her actions}} on fatigue and insisted she hadn't {{had too much}} to drink. [...] "I didn't have a lot of wine," [...] May said, [...] "but it may have hit me harder than I thought it would". When {{questioned}} if she should resign, May responded that [...] "a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell." [...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing,</b> she's apologized," [...] Peck said. [...] "One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern." [...] It's more of an [...] "inside Ottawa beltway" [...] thing anyway, Peck added.|$|E
