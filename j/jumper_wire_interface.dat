5000|$|A jump wire (also {{known as}} <b>jumper,</b> <b>jumper</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>jumper</b> cable, DuPont <b>wire,</b> or DuPont cable - named for one {{manufacturer}} of them) is an electrical wire {{or group of}} them in a cable with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply [...] "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.|$|R

50|$|Each jumper is {{a twisted}} pair.

5000|$|The {{vertical}} blocks {{are used}} to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks {{are used to}} terminate inside plant equipment.

40|$|This tutorial shows you how to program an ATtiny 45  or ATtiny 85  microcontroller using the Arduino {{software}} and hardware. The ATtiny 45  and ATtiny 85  are small (8 leg),  cheap ($ 23)   microcontrollers that are convenient for running simple programs. This tutorial is obsolete!  See the updated version of this tutorial (with support for Arduino  1. 0). They are almost identical,  except that the ATtiny 85  has twice the memory of the ATtiny 45  and can therefore hold more complex programs. We like to use both of them with paper circuits and other craft electronics. To program them,  we’ll use a port of the Arduino core libraries created by Alessandro Saporetti and slightly modified by HLT. Materials and Tools For this tutorial,  you’ll need: Arduino Uno or Duemilanove (w /  an ATmega 328,  not an older board with an ATmega 168) ATtiny 45 or ATtiny 85  (8 pin DIP package) a 10  uF capacitor (e. g.  from Sparkfun or from DigiKey) {{a breadboard}} <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> For more information,  see our list of materials and parts and our list of prototyping supplies.

50|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the safety system on the Michigan Line, a derailment occurred just east of Niles, Michigan, on October 21, 2012, after a Wolverine train exited the main line and entered a freight yard due to a misaligned switch. The train had a green signal and was traveling at about 60 mph when it hit the switch. The incident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and was found to be Amtrak's fault, caused by one of its employees improperly applying <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> to the signal system, bypassing safeguards that had been designed to prevent such an occurrence.|$|R
2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters.

Meter movements as separate components may be protected {{in the same manner}} by connecting a shorting or <b>jumper</b> <b>wire</b> between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.|$|R
50|$|On many TEA2025-based boards, Creative used 47uF {{capacitors}} for the amplifiers {{inverting input}} DC decoupling (connecting the Feedback pins on the amplifiers pin-out), whereas the datasheet recommended 100uF units against {{an increase in}} low-pass cutoff. In addition, Creative installed 1 uF input decoupling capacitors on the TEA2025s inputs, which according to the datasheet should have been 0.22uF units and were only necessary when a volume control slider or knob was present, but were installed regardless if the volume knob was present. (These capacitors may be replaced with short <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> if no volume control slider or knob is present.) Finally, Creative used polarized capacitors where non-polarized capacitors should have been used.|$|R

5000|$|... 1940s {{tube-type}} land mobile two way radios {{often had}} one channel and were carrier squelch. Because radios were costly {{and there were}} fewer radio users, {{it might be the}} case that no one else nearby used the same channel. A transmit and receive crystal had to be ordered for the desired channel frequency, then the radio had to be tuned or aligned to work on the channel. 12-volt mobile, tube-type radios drew several amperes on standby and tens-of-amperes on transmit. Equipment worked ideally when new. The performance of vacuum tubes gradually degraded over time. US regulations required an indicator lamp showing the transmitter had power applied and was ready to transmit and a second indicator, (usually red,) that showed the transmitter was on. In radios with options, <b>wire</b> <b>jumpers</b> and discrete components were used to select options. To change a setting, the technician soldered an option <b>jumper</b> <b>wire</b> then made any corresponding adjustments.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, a main {{distribution}} frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk {{main distribution}} frame (TMDF).|$|R

30|$|The WCE has no {{view on the}} {{availability}} and capacity of the wireless links {{that are part of}} its connection with the MCE. The WCE's <b>wired</b> <b>interface</b> could continuously pull data to be sent, as the first wired links of its connection towards the trains will be quite fast in comparison with the last wireless links. The WCE will therefore need to tune its sending rate to the buffer size of the tunneling protocol(s) instead of using the data rate of its <b>wired</b> Ethernet <b>interface.</b> The MCE could also communicate the current available capacity on the wireless links to the WCE, but this mechanism will be too slow to react to changing conditions.|$|R
50|$|Jump <b>wires</b> (also called <b>jumper</b> <b>wires)</b> for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the wire ends. Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} wire ends. The wire ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|R
