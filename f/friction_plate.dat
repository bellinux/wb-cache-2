Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a sprag clutch is connected to just half of the clutch <b>friction</b> <b>plates,</b> allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

In {{order to have}} strong torque, multi <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> are installed in the friction unit of the device that involves magnetorheological fluid. Two permanent magnets lie {{on both sides of}} the friction unit. Hence, electromagnetic forces freeze the magnetorheological fluid.

50|$|A {{magnetic}} particle clutch {{is a special}} type of electromagnetic clutch which does not use <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b> Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise free wheeling disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft.|$|R
50|$|A {{torque limiter}} is an {{automatic}} device that protects mechanical equipment, or its work, from damage by mechanical overload. A torque limiter may limit the torque by slipping (as in a <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> slip-clutch), or uncouple the load entirely (as in a shear pin). The action of a torque limiter is especially useful to limit any damage due to crash stops and jams.|$|E
50|$|This type {{is similar}} to a <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> clutch. Over-torque will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the {{slipping}} torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.|$|E

50|$|Attached to the {{transaxle}} is a Power Transfer Unit (PTU), {{which is}} connected to a rear axle through a propeller shaft. The PTU also feeds torque through itself to the front axle. At the rear axle, torque was first sent through a viscous coupling before reaching the final drive gearset. This coupling contained <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> and an oil just viscous enough so that pressure affected how many plates were connected and active (and therefore, how much power was being delivered to the rear wheels).|$|R

40|$|Wear of {{friction}} plates for wet clutch applications {{can result in}} a decreasing transmittable torque and the occurrence of vibrations throughout the entire drive chain causing loss of performance and discomfort. The need for a simple wear model exists to predict the lifetime of the clutch and to give an insight in the combined influence of the operational parameters such as pressure and speed.

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the clutch driven platen <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

50|$|The damping {{rate for}} {{frictional}} dampers {{has less than}} ideal behaviour for car suspension. An ideal suspension would offer more damping to greater suspension forces, with less damping at low speeds for a smoother ride. Frictional dampers though had a mostly constant rate. This was even greater when stationary, owing to stiction between stationary plates. For larger bumps the damping may even be reduced. This is particularly a problem for fast driving, when repeated high forces may cause the <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> to heat up and lose their efficiency.|$|R

The cooling ribs are located between two <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> through which air flows in the positive radial direction, dissipating heat. It was observed that up to 77 % of the heat was dissipated by the cooling ribs in a drag brake scenario [4]. On the other hand, in an emergency stop scenario, this number is smaller, as the cooling area of the rib is heated up less due to there being too little time to conduct heat towards the cooling ribs. The dissipation percentage depends on the braking regime, since it is time- and temperature-dependent.|$|R
