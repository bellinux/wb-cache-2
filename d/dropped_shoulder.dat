In presented designs the geometrical lines, which form the <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the sleeves, are the same for the four jackets. Of course these lines can be with different geometrical form and directions, but main idea in presented models was subjection of the other elements to the lines which form the <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulders.</b> By this reason the jackets’ designs are without collars, pockets and other types of small parts and elements, and the other using forming elements are designed in shapes which are simple or connected to leading lines...|$|R

Materials and Methods This descriptive-analytical {{study was conducted in}} 2015 in Abadan, Iran, and 383 elementary school students were selected and enrolled using the cluster sampling method. Data was collected through the grid method and a demographic questionnaire. The weights of students’ backpacks were recorded, and it was determined whether they were standard or not. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22, descriptive statistics, and the Chi-square test. Results Findings showed that 36. 9 % of public school students’ backpacks and 55. 1 % of private school students’ backpacks were non-standard with respect to weight. A significant relationship was also found between non-standard backpack weight and prevalence of <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulders,</b> kyphosis and lordosis (...|$|R

40|$|Background and PurposezzCervical radiculopathy is a {{pathological}} process involving a nerve {{root of the}} cervical spine. The most common causes of radiculopathy are cervical disc herniation followed by cervical spondylosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulder</b> as a cause of lower cervical radiculopathy. MethodszzIn total, 132 patients, comprising 105 women (79. 5 %) and 27 men (20. 5 %; female: male ratio of 4 : 1) and a mean age of 36. 7 years (range 18 - 58 years), were included in this study. All of the patients presented with shoulder pain, and were investigated by cervical X-ray, cervical magnetic resonance imaging, serum muscle enzymes, and electromyography (EMG) /nerve-conduction studies. ResultszzNinety six patients (72. 7 %) exhibited visually detectable <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The lateral view X-ray of the cervical region revealed eight or more vertebrae. In 119 patients (90. 2 %), the EMG revealed a mild-to-moderate or moderate denervation patterns in the abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interosseous, and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, while the abductor pollicis brevis, extensor carpi radialis, and triceps brachii were denervated in 102 patients (77. 3 %). All of the patients had lower cervical paraspinal muscles with a denervation pattern. ConclusionszzThree criteria for diagnosing <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulder</b> syndrome have been suggested: pain with consistent anatomical distribution, X-ray abnormalities, and EMG abnormalities. Compression of the cervical roots by muscle spasm has been proposed as the cause of <b>dropped</b> <b>shoulder</b> syndrome; this possibility is discussed herein.

40|$|AbstractGenerally textual {{passwords}} {{are used}} for authentication, but textual passwords are vulnerable to many attacks such as dictionary attack, eves <b>dropping,</b> <b>shoulder</b> surfing and social engineering. Graphical passwords are introduced to overcome the disadvantages of textual password {{but many of the}} graphical passwords are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To overcome this problem session passwords are created. In the proposed authentication scheme we generate session password using text and colors. Pair based authentication and hybrid textual authentication are the two authentication techniques used to prevent shoulder surfing. For text we use pair based authentication and for color we use hybrid textual authentication. It is the theoretical experimentation of graphical authentication to prevent shoulder surfing. The implementation of the project is under progress...|$|R
