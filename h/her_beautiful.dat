5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E
5|$|With her task finished, Elspeth {{tries to}} resume <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> guise with the mirror. But instead, the magic mirror returns {{her to her}} true form, even more loathsome than before, as {{punishment}} from the Green-Eyed One for killing her stepdaughter. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to save Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a kiss of true love from Prince Alfred, in his bear form, she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday, and Monday break, and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John. Elspeth gets cornered, tackled, and killed by the gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green-Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred {{live happily ever after}} while the dwarfs decide to move on to find Sleeping Beauty.|$|E

5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E

25|$|Thirteen-year-old Meg Murry's {{classmates and}} {{teachers}} {{see her as}} a troublesome and stubborn student. Her family knows that she is emotionally immature but also sees her capable of doing great things. The family includes <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> scientist mother, her missing scientist father, her athletic 10-year-old twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys; and her five-year-old brother Charles Wallace Murry, a child prodigy genius who can sometimes read Meg's mind.|$|E
25|$|Remedios was the {{youngest}} daughter of the town's Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote.

25|$|Raquel Welch helped {{transform}} America’s feminine ideal {{into its}} current state. <b>Her</b> <b>beautiful</b> looks and eroticism {{made her the}} definitive 1960s and 1970s sex icon, rather than the blonde bombshell of the late 1950s as typified by Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and others. Welch became {{a star in the}} mid-1960s and was exotic, brunette, and smolderingly sexual. Her countless publicity photos helped to popularize her image, dress style, and 1960s and 1970s fashion trends. Welch and other actresses also made big hair popular.|$|E
25|$|When {{the text}} resumes, the companions have {{apparently}} been in Crotona {{for some time}} (125). A maid named Chrysis flirts with Encolpius and brings to him <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> mistress Circe, who asks him for sex. However, his attempts are prevented by impotence (126–128). Circe and Encolpius exchange letters, and he seeks a cure by sleeping without Giton (129–130). When he next meets Circe, she brings with her an elderly enchantress called Proselenos who attempts a magical cure (131). Nonetheless, he fails again to make love, as Circe has Chrysis and him flogged (132).|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} the {{transformation}} of Onibaba is the anime and manga Kurozuka. In this series the Noh story of the Onibaba is portrayed, with the Onibaba masquerading as a beautiful woman with a slender body and long dark hair and with powers similar to a vampire. The difference between the Noh story and the series is that instead of the two priests escaping, one of the men, a feudal lord, {{falls in love with}} the Onibaba in <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> form and is transformed into a vampire by the Onibaba and her vampiristic powers.|$|E
25|$|After her {{conversion}} to the Bábí faith, the poems of Táhirih flourished. In most {{she talks about}} her longing to meet the Báb. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which Táhirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One {{of the most famous}} poems attributed to her is named Point by Point. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tabátabá'i to be older and by someone else – though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When Táhirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that Táhirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. `Abdu'l-Bahá recalls that when he was aged five Táhirih would chant her poetry to him in <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> voice. Edward Granville Browne procured her poems from Bábí, Bahá'í and Azali sources and published them in his book A Year Amongst the Persians.|$|E

60|$|Oh, make no mistake. I am no callow, ardent youth. I am {{an elderly}} man, broken {{in health and}} body, and soon to die. I am a {{scientist}} and a philosopher. I, as all the generations of philosophers before me, know woman for what she is--her weaknesses, and meannesses, and immodesties, and ignobilities, her earth-bound feet, and her eyes that have never seen the stars. But--and the everlasting, irrefragable fact remains: <b>Her</b> feet are <b>beautiful,</b> <b>her</b> eyes are <b>beautiful,</b> <b>her</b> arms and breasts are paradise, her charm is potent beyond all charm that has ever dazzled men; and, as the pole willy-nilly draws the needle, just so, willy-nilly, does she draw men.|$|R
500|$|The best-known {{example of}} mermaids in {{literature}} is probably Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, The Little Mermaid, {{first published in}} 1837. [...] In the original story, a young mermaid {{falls in love with}} a human prince whom she saves from drowning when his ship is wrecked in a storm. [...] Although her grandmother tells her not to envy humans, who live much shorter lives than mermaids, and whose only consolation is an immortal soul, the mermaid chooses to risk her life in order to be with the prince. [...] She trades her tongue and <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> voice to the sea-witch in exchange for a draught that will make her human and allow her to live on land. [...] She will have to rely on her beauty and charm to win the prince's love, as she will be entirely mute.|$|E
500|$|Cable's {{mission is}} to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy {{officers}} ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French. [...] Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted {{to each other and}} make love ("Younger Than Springtime"). [...] Billis {{and the rest of the}} crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat ("Bali Ha'i" [...] (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.|$|E
500|$|One of deHavilland's most noted {{performances}} {{during this}} period was in Guy Green's romantic drama Light in the Piazza (1962) with Rossano Brazzi. Filmed in Florence and Rome, and based on Elizabeth Spencer's novel of the same name, the film is about a middle-class American tourist on extended vacation in Italy with <b>her</b> <b>beautiful</b> 26-year-old daughter, who is mentally disabled {{as a result of}} a childhood accident. Faced with the prospect of her daughter falling in love with a young Italian, the mother struggles with conflicting emotions about her daughter's future. DeHavilland projects a calm maternal serenity throughout most of the film, only showing glimpses of the worried mother anxious for her child's happiness. The film was released on February 19, 1962, and was well received, with a Hollywood Reporter reviewer calling it [...] "an uncommon love story ... told with rare delicacy and force", and Variety noting that the film [...] "achieves the rare and delicate balance of artistic beauty, romantic substance, dramatic novelty and commercial appeal". Variety singled out deHavilland’s performance as [...] "one of great consistency and subtle projection".|$|E
