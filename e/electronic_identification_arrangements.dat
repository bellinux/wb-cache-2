40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an implementation {{study on the}} handling of <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> in three public authorities in Sweden. <b>Electronic</b> <b>identification</b> is a complex but very topical policy domain, largely tied to the general policy aspirations of e-government development. Theories on policy action, logic of appropriateness, garbage cans, and the dialectics of institutions and technology are used. The result highlights that the policy process of <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> in the three studied authorities could not be adequately explained from a traditional policy-implementation dichotomy. The action imperative to develop e-services is very strong and explains why and how <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> has been developed within the three authorities. The three authorities have very different institutional capacity to implement e-services with <b>electronic</b> <b>identification.</b> The available technology on <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> is inscribed with certain logics of appropriateness, that doesn’t sit equally easy with the administrative logics of appropriateness in all three authorities...|$|R

It builds on the observation that the eSignature Directive has largely been unable to support an internal market for certification service providers, partially because it insufficiently considers the essential link between e-signatures and ancillary services. <b>Electronic</b> <b>identification</b> is one of these ancillary services. The current review of the Directive is an opportunity to remedy this issue. Â Based on this idea, this paper examines the possibility of creating a comprehensive framework for trust services, that would also include <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> services. Â...|$|R

The first chapter is a literature review on electronic devices used for livestock identification. The other chapters describe experimental work on <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> devices, mostly in dairy sheep but also in goats. Chapter 2 deals with {{the effect of the}} presence and permanence time (from few days to 9 years) of four types of ceramic boluses (differing in capsule size, weight and material) used for <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> of Sarda sheep in six farms on the reticulum and chemical-physical characteristics of the interface surface. The boluses showed the presence of calcium, manganese, and zinc salts. The long-term permanence of the bolus in situ caused little changes in the mucosa which did not seem to impair the organ function. Chapter 3 comparing traditional and <b>electronic</b> animal <b>identification</b> in dairy sheep farms showed that the <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> device was more realiable, effective and efficient than the ear tag and ear tattoo. Chapter 4 studied possible correlations between the presence of rumen bolus and calcium content in blood, during pregnancy and lactation, and in milk in early, mid and late lactation in Sarda sheep. Calcium content in blood and milk did not differ between ewes with or without ceramic bolus. Chapter 5 concerns animal reading and data collection efficiency of automated milk recording in dairy sheep and goats...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>identification</b> is an {{increasingly}} pervasive technology that permits rapid data recovery from low-power transponders whenever they are placed within {{the vicinity of}} an interrogator device. Fundamental benefits include proximity detection not requiring line-of-sight, multiple transponder access and data security. In this document, <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> methods for asset management are devised for the new target application of electrical appliance testing. In this application mains-powered apparatus are periodically subjected a prescribed series of electrical tests performed by a Portable Appliance Tester (PAT). The intention is to enhance the process of appliance identification and management, and to automate the test process as far as possible. Three principal methods of <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> were designed and analysed for this application: proximity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), cable RFID and power- line signalling. Each method relies on an inductively coupled mechanism that utilities a signalling technique called direct-load modulation. This is particularly suited to low- cost passive transponder designs. Physical limitations to proximity RFID are identified including coil size, orientation and susceptibility to nearby conducting surfaces. A novel inductive signalling method called cable RFID is then described that permits automatic appliance identification. This method uses the appliance power cable and inlet filter to establish a communication channel between interrogator and transponder. Prior to commencing the test phase, an appliance is plugged into the PAT and identified automatically via cable RFID. An attempt is made to extend the scope of cable RFID by developing a novel mains power-line signalling method that uses direct-load modulation and passive transponders. Finally, two different implementations of RFID interrogator are described. The first {{takes the form of}} an embeddable module intended for incorporation into <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> products such as RFID enabled PAT units. Software Defined Radio (SDR) principles are applied to the second interrogator design in an effort to render the device reconfigurable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Until the 1990 s, the purposes of farm and animal identification were primarily related to implementation of breeding schemes and health programmes.
