5|$|ICD-10 {{includes}} in its diagnosis {{psychological and}} physical abuse and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> {{does not lead to}} attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|When {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery {{contained}} 34 paintings {{and by the}} end of its run it had between 167 and 170. The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became a fashionable attraction. It took over the public's imagination and became an end <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> broad <b>and</b> {{everyday}} terms, {{a person}} is insolvent when {{he is unable to}} pay his debts. In legal terms, however, the test for insolvency {{is whether or not the}} debtor’s liabilities, fairly estimated, exceed his assets, fairly valued. Inability to pay debts is, at most, merely evidence, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> <b>of</b> insolvency.|$|R
50|$|For Arato, {{this new}} focus on civil society constituted, in part, a {{rejection}} of the traditional Marxian problematic for a post-Marxist one. He <b>and</b> intellectuals <b>in</b> Eastern Europe criticized Marx’s advocacy of a radical democratic reunification <b>of</b> state <b>and</b> society <b>in</b> a supposedly collective free social order. They rejected Marx’s idea of ending of the distinction <b>of</b> state <b>and</b> society (or state and market), along with his conception of an unalienated collective subject, totally undivided <b>and</b> <b>in</b> control <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> The experience <b>of</b> Eastern Europe <b>and</b> Russia suggested this utopian merging <b>of</b> government <b>and</b> society inevitably resulted in authoritarian forms of rule. It resulted either in the loss of independent freedom of civil society under the embracing control of the party-state or else it saw regression in economic rationality as the community or state subjected the economy to their traditional norms and political calculations.|$|R
5|$|Originally {{intended}} just {{to convince}} Fox to fund some shooting in Paris, Frankel's sizzle reel led {{the studio to}} put a stronger marketing push behind the movie. It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to Superman Returns {{at the end of}} June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
25|$|There is pre-historic {{evidence}} that shows brewing began around 5400 BC in Sumer (southern Iraq). However, {{as with the}} history of corn whiskey, the production of other alcoholic beverages is often seen as a way to preserve excess grain, rather than an occupation <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Boeing was {{experienced}} at selling {{to the military}} but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at {{meeting the needs of}} airlines by refining and developing its range <b>of</b> propeller-driven aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> – was to show them a completed aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The {{first of}} these is {{somewhat}} controversial, being a commission rather than omission <b>and</b> because abuse <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> {{does not lead to}} attachment disorder.|$|R
25|$|The 4-H {{name and}} emblem have U.S. federal {{protection}},under federal code 18 U.S.C. 707. This federal protection {{makes it a}} mark unto <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> with protection that supersedes the limited authorities of both a trademark and a copyright. The Secretary of Agriculture is given responsibility and stewardship for the 4-H name and emblem, at the direct request of the U.S. Congress. These protections place the 4-H emblem in a unique category of protected emblems, along with the U.S. Presidential Seal, Red Cross, Smokey Bear and the Olympic rings.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was {{practicing}} medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days). It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Just as open syllables {{have ten}} vowels, so too do closed syllables: /æ/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /u̯æ~ʊ/ /u̯ɛ/ /u̯ɪ/ /eɪ/ /oʊ/ /aɪ/ /aʊ/. It {{is worth noting}} that in Yangon MSB no vowel quality exists in both closed and open syllables, and that {{therefore}} nasalisation cannot be said to be a contrastive feature <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Canada {{formally}} decriminalized mixed {{martial arts}} with {{a vote on}} Bill S-209 on June 5, 2013. The bill formally gives provinces the power to create athletic commissions to regulate and sanction professional mixed martial arts bouts. Bill S-209 does not <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> make MMA legal across Canada; it allows provinces to make it legal on a province by province basis.|$|E

500|$|Due to this issue, a {{controversy}} arose over {{who should be}} recognized as the official discoverer of the element. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report. They stated that the GSI collaboration was [...] "more detailed <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> carries conviction", <b>and</b> that while the combined data from Dubna and Darmstadt confirmed that hassium had been synthesized, the major credit was awarded to the GSI. This statement came {{in spite of the}} combined data also supporting the Russian 1983 discovery claim and the TWG also acknowledging that [...] "very probably element 108 {{played a role in the}} Dubna experiment." ...|$|R
2500|$|The legal {{profession}} in the British Virgin Islands is a fused profession. [...] Most resident {{lawyers in the}} Territory are also members of the BVI Bar Association, although that is a voluntary association <b>and</b> does not <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> have any power to regulate.|$|R
25|$|Each feed {{also had}} its own {{completely}} separate newscast, produced at its own facility. Viewers in Toronto never saw an anchor from Vancouver, and vice versa. The newscast was aired at 19:30 local time, and presented by only one anchor. Each feed also had its local weather segment, which was aired immediately after the newscast as a separate programme <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{port scan}} or portscan {{is a process}} that sends client {{requests}} to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port; this is not a nefarious process <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> The majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks, but rather simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, (conservative) Religious Zionists {{differ with}} Modern Orthodoxy in its {{approach}} to secular knowledge. Here, engagement with the secular is permissible, and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel; secular knowledge (or, at the least, an extensive secular education) is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> See further under Torah Umadda.|$|E
50|$|Capesterre-de-Marie-Galante (often simply {{referred}} to as Capesterre) is a commune {{on the island of}} Marie-Galante, in the French overseas region <b>and</b> department <b>of</b> Guadeloupe, <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the Lesser Antilles.|$|R

25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou {{thought a}} lot about the human crave for meaning, and about the absurdity of the human condition, rooted in matter but yearning for spirit. He was thinking about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|Adam is {{the first}} human created by God. Though {{initially}} alone, Adam demands a mate from God. Considered God's prized creation, Adam, along with his wife, rules over all the creatures {{of the world and}} resides in the Garden of Eden. He is more gregarious than Eve, and yearns for her company. His complete infatuation with Eve, while pure <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> eventually contributes to his joining her in disobedience to God.|$|E
25|$|Spring Landscape {{features}} {{a full moon}} shining above a solitary cherry tree in full bloom planted on the slope of a mountain. It retains the monochrome style with its refined Chinese associations, but adds sparing use of colour in the slight pink of the cherry blossoms, symbolic of spring, <b>of</b> transience <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Japan <b>itself.</b>|$|R
2500|$|This empire was {{powerful}} but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all - <b>of</b> Athens' allies <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Athens <b>itself</b> - <b>and</b> their power was undivided. By {{the end of}} the century, they could not even defend their own city. [...] As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta.|$|R

25|$|The still life, {{which had}} often been {{considered}} a minor genre, flourished throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In Spain, this particular subject matter was termed bodegón and depicted in an austere gloomy style (tenebrismo). Van der Hamen was considered as the greatest Spanish still life painter of the seventeenth century, when that form was revived as a worthy subject <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> {{rather than as an}} adjunct to a symbolic or narrative work.|$|E
25|$|The term negrito {{was coined}} by the Spaniards {{based on their}} appearance. The word 'negrito' would be misinterpreted and used by future European {{scholars}} as an ethnoracial term <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> Both Christianized negritos {{who lived in the}} colony and un-Christianized negritos who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified as 'negritos'. Christianized negritos who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for indios.|$|E
25|$|Economist Paul A. Samuelson {{wrote in}} 1964 that most economists believe that {{economic}} conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak. According to Samuelson and economist Bryan Caplan, Mises' deductive methodology also embraced by Murray Rothbard {{and to a}} lesser extent by Mises' student, Israel Kirzner was not sufficient <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> Bryan Caplan wrote that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions helped work towards making those assumptions more plausible.|$|E
50|$|Anti-genre is a self-descriptive label {{attributed}} to any artistic style devoid of genre. This lack of genre-status {{can either be}} the result of:(1) an active attempt to evade categorization (transcend all genres), (2) conscious negation of the ethos of its medium (unlearning of history),(3) an active <b>and</b> conscious negation <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{railways}} spelled the end <b>of</b> Kirkstead's isolation <b>and</b> eventually <b>of</b> Kirkstead <b>itself,</b> as Woodhall Spa's increasing popularity led it {{to expand}} outwards into Kirkstead parish until {{it reached the}} banks of the River Witham.|$|R
500|$|James was ambitious {{to build}} on the {{personal}} union of the Crowns <b>of</b> Scotland <b>and</b> England to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan that met opposition in both realms. [...] "Hath He not made us all in one island," [...] James told the English Parliament, [...] "compassed with one sea <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> by nature indivisible?" [...] In April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled [...] "King of Great Britain" [...] on legal grounds. In October 1604, he assumed the title [...] "King of Great Britain" [...] by proclamation rather than by statute, though Sir Francis Bacon told him that he could not use the style in [...] "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance" [...] and the title was not used on English statutes. James forced the Parliament of Scotland to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, <b>and</b> treaties <b>in</b> both realms.|$|R
