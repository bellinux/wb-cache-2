40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, the ability to appeal APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines the APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers appeal? Who has the fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of the APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|R

Lack of practical due process can shift the property tax burden to the homeowner and small business person.

To show that such taxpayers will find the cost of appealing their local property taxes difficult and costly, this article discusses the issues of valuation and equalization—how and when they must be raised if they are to be successfully argued. The article explains how a taxpayer may be assessed without the right to notice or protest when real property has been undervalued, and it discusses exemptions and the unique rules which apply. Finally, it explains when and how refunds may be obtained...|$|R
