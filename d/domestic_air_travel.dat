25|$|The fixed link has {{generated}} increased road traffic volume, which has meant increased air pollution.

Train and car ferries consume much energy for propulsion, high-speed ferries consume large amounts of energy at high speeds, and air transport is highly energy consuming. <b>Domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> over the Great Belt was greatly reduced after {{the opening of the}} bridge, with the former air travellers now using trains and private cars.|$|E

25|$|Qantas {{has also}} {{expanded}} into the New Zealand <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> market, firstly with a shareholding in Air New Zealand {{and then with}} a franchise takeover of Ansett New Zealand. In 2003, Qantas attempted and failed to obtain regulatory approval to purchase a larger (but still minority) stake in Air New Zealand. Subsequently Qantas stepped up competition on the trans-Tasman routes, introducing Jetstar to New Zealand. British Airways sold its 18.5% stake in Qantas in September 2004 for £425million, though keeping its close ties with Qantas intact.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{passenger}} {{flights were}} launched by BEA in 18 April 1953, the world's first scheduled turboprop airline service. BEA became a large user of the Viscount, {{as well the}} rival Handley Page Dart Herald; by mid-1958 BEA's Viscount fleet had carried over 2.75million passengers over 200,000 flight hours. Following BEA's launch of the type, multiple independent charter operators such as British Eagle were quick to adopt the Viscount into their fleets.

50|$|In {{response}} to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented new rules {{to ensure the safety}} of <b>domestic</b> and international <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> in the United States.

25|$|The {{accident}} was particularly alarming in that {{public confidence in}} air travel had increased during the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} new airliners like the Super Constellation, Douglas DC-7, and Boeing Stratocruiser. Travel by air had become routine for large corporations, and vacationers often considered flying instead of traveling by train. At the time, a congressional committee was reviewing <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>travel,</b> as there was growing concern over the number of accidents. However, little progress was being made and the state of ATC {{at the time of the}} Grand Canyon accident reflected the methods of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} on 13 March 1988, having cost {{a total of}} ¥538.4billion (US$3.6 billion) to construct. Once the tunnel was completed, all railway {{transport}} between Honshu and Hokkaido used it. However, for passenger transport, 90% of people use air due to the speed and cost. For example, to travel between Tokyo and Sapporo by train takes more than nine hours, with several transfers. By air, the journey is three hours and thirty minutes, including airport access times. Deregulation and competition in Japanese <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> has brought down prices on the Tokyo-Sapporo route, making rail more expensive in comparison.|$|E

The first sod at Tullamarine was turned two years later in November 1964.

40|$|As part {{of their}} {{everyday}} marketing practice, companies contribute to perform their customers. This includes deciding upon and implementing strategies of approaching customers, be {{it in order to}} alert interest in the first place, to realise commercial exchanges, or to promote the repetition of such exchanges. An important part of the marketing process is also to create representations of these customers, e. g. in terms of surveys, loyalty programs, satisfaction indices, etc. Although continuously discussed within marketing departments, the question of who the customers are and what it is they demand is not as often given public attention. This paper follows the efforts to reduce the ambiguity of the customer concept during a legal controversy between Scandinavian Airline Systems and the Swedish Competition Authority in the Swedish Market court, the supreme national legal instance for market surveillance. The issue at stake is whether SAS, by applying their Frequent Flyer Program on <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>travels</b> in Sweden, is abusing their dominant position. During the proceedings, the character of the domestic airline customer becomes a central topic, and each party seeks to establish their version. It is suggested that the ambiguity surrounding the customer concept in the controversy can be attributed to differences between the model underlying the European competition law and the model underlying modern marketing practice...|$|R

40|$|Background. Planning for a {{possible}} influenza pandemic is an extremely high priority, as social and economic effects of an unmitigated pandemic would be devastating. Mathematical models {{can be used to}} explore different scenarios and provide insight into potential costs, benefits, and effectiveness of prevention and control strategies under consideration. Methods and Findings. A stochastic, equation-based epidemic model is used to study global transmission of pandemic flu, including the effects of travel restrictions and vaccination. Economic costs of intervention are also considered. The distribution of First Passage Times (FPT) to the United States and the numbers of infected persons in metropolitan areas worldwide are studied assuming various times and locations of the initial outbreak. International <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> restrictions alone provide a small delay in FPT to the U. S. When other containment measures are applied at the source in conjunction with travel restrictions, delays could be much longer. If in addition, control measures are instituted worldwide, there is a significant reduction in cases worldwide and specifically in the U. S. However, if travel restrictions are not combined with other measures, local epidemic severity may increase, because restriction-induced delays can push local outbreaks into high epidemic season. The per annum cost to the U. S. economy of international and major <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> passenger <b>travel</b> restrictions is minimal: on the order of 0. 8 % of Gross National Product. Conclusions.

S. <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> and of <b>domestic</b> and intraregional EU <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> is estimated. For the United States, an {{analysis}} of the Origin and Destination Data Bank 1 A Ticket Dollar Value database shows that the average effective tax rate increased from 10. 9 % in 1993 to 16. 1 % in 2004. A large portion of the increase is due to a striking 25 % decline in the real average base fare. The relative impact of taxes and fees is great-est on the least expensive tickets. The effective tax rate for low-cost car-riers is moderately greater than for legacy carriers. For the European Union, a sample of about 335, 000 tickets from January 13 and 14, 2004, was used, with the effective tax rate estimated at 12. 5 %. However, EU taxes and fees do not cover the cost of air navigation services, and thus the 12. 5 % effective tax rate should not be compared with the 16. 1 % U. S. rate. A preliminary correction for this difference suggests that the true effective tax rate is higher in the European Union than in the Unite...|$|R
