500|$|In its 7 December 2010 issue, Heat {{magazine}} said series 7 of The X Factor {{had been}} the best series to date, citing many of the controversies, plus events such as Lloyd singing on a spiral staircase, Wagner's [...] "ludicrous" [...] performances and Walsh likening Richardson to [...] "a little Lenny Henry", as moments that helped make it [...] "the most deliriously, thrilling, controversial and demented yet. [...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. Whatever you think of Simon Cowell's programmes, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> credit for achieving that." ...|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second time}} was in October 2000. It is alleged that Ney, like other Republicans in the House, was under {{pressure}} {{to raise money for}} the Republican National Congressional Committee (RNCC) in October 2000, a month prior to the November elections. In an October 23 e-mail from Abramoff to Scanlon, Abramoff asked [...] "Would 10K for NRCC from Suncruz for Ney help?" [...] Scanlon replied, [...] "Yes, a lot! But would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a definite answer—and they need it this week".|$|E
2500|$|Thompson's {{appointment}} as minority {{counsel to the}} Senate Watergate committee reportedly upset Nixon, who believed Thompson was not skilled enough to interrogate unfriendly witnesses and would be outfoxed by the committee Democrats. According to historian Stanley Kutler, however, Thompson and Baker [...] "carried water for the White House, but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> credit—they were watching out for their interests, too... They weren't going to mindlessly go down the tubes [...]" [...] When the Watergate investigation began to pick up speed, tapes revealed that Nixon remarked to his then–Chief of Staff Alexander Haig, [...] "Oh shit, he's dumb as hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having a {{dedicated}} fanbase composed mostly by female and gay people, Tsai {{is considered a}} gay icon. In 2007, Tsai's [...] "Bravo Lover" [...] became the theme song of the 2007 Taiwan Pride parade. Her other songs, including [...] "Fantasy", [...] "Dr. Jolin", [...] "Gentlewoman", and [...] "We're All Different, Yet the Same", all cater to the gay audience and support same-sex love. In 2012, she signed the petition calling for Taiwan's government passing Marriage Equality Act and legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Recognized as a long-term ally of the LGBT community, Tsai was given the Icon Award at the 2nd Asia LGBT Milestone Awards to praise her putting aside the pressure of public opinion and appreciate her using her influence to support same-sex love in Chinese-speaking world. In 2015, Tsai featured {{on the cover of}} lesbian-themed magazine Lezs. In an interview with Lezs, she spoke about homophobia and advocated people to embrace all kinds of love. She stated, [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the time to get to understand one another, since the definition of love varies from person to person." [...] During her Play World Tour (2015–2016), Tsai gave a speech to support transgender people, and spoke against the bullying of children and teenagers in general, including the bullying of gay teens and a related recent suicide in Taiwan.|$|E

60|$|Terni, like so {{many other}} towns in the neighborhood, stands in a high and {{commanding}} position, chosen doubtless for its facilities of defence, in days long before the mediaeval warfares of Italy made such sites desirable. I suppose that, like Narni and Otricoli, it was a city of the Umbrians. We reached it between eleven and twelve o'clock, intending to employ the afternoon on a visit to the famous falls of Terni; but, after lowering all day, it has begun to rain, and we shall probably <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> up.|$|E

Of course, {{a good deal}} {{depends on how you}} set about this kind of thing, and the correct way would have been to come in on a Pullman instead of a cattle-car, and then engage a suite of rooms at the biggest hotel. Financiers and company jobbers seem rather shy of a man who gives Lemoine's boarding-house as his address, {{and some of them are}} not quite civil when they hear what he has to say to them.

5000|$|The Talk of the Town {{began with}} the working title [...] "Mr. Twilight", but Cary Grant insisted it be changed, suspecting that if the movie {{appeared}} to be about a single male character, then Colman, who had the better role, would steal the show.

They say that in Assam their leaders are openly boasting that, ere long, they will drive us completely from India; and one of their generals has confidently declared that, after taking India, they intend to conquer England. With such ignorant people, there is but one argument understood--namely, force; and sooner or later we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> such a hearty thrashing that they will be quiet for some time.|$|E

Bah! Impartial justice? 'Tis force, strength, Spartan vigour that we want ... and I'll show them.... Listen to my plan, citizen Martin-Roget, {{and see how it}} will work in with yours. My idea is to collect together all the most disreputable and notorious evil-doers of this city ... there are plenty in the entrepôt at the present moment, and there are plenty more still at large in the streets of Nantes--thieves, malefactors, forgers of State bonds, assassins and women of evil fame ... and to send them in a batch to Paris to appear before the Committee of Public Safety, whilst I will send to my colleagues there a letter couched in terms of gentle reproach: 'See!' I shall say, 'what I have to contend with in Nantes. See! the moral pestilence that infests the city. These evil-doers are but a few among the hundreds and thousands of whom I am vainly trying to purge this city which you have entrusted to my care!'

They say that they had got hold of {{evidence}} enough against him to hang a dozen men, and it seems that {{there is little doubt that}} he was concerned in several cases, where, not content with robbing, the villain had murdered the inmates of lonely houses round London. He had good cause for hating you. It was through you that he had been captured, and had lost his share in all that plunder at Marner's. Well, I trust the villain will never venture to show his face in London again; but there is never any saying. I should like to meet that captain who behaved so well to you, and I will meet him too, and shake him by the hand and tell him that any gear he may want for that ketch of his, he is free to come in here to help himself. There is another thing to be thought of. I must go round in the morning to the Guildhall and notify the authorities that you have come back. There has been a great hue and cry for you. They have searched the thieves' dens of London from attic to cellar; there have been boats out looking for your body; and on the day after you were missing they overhauled all the ships in the port. Of course the search has died out now, but I must go and tell them, and you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the story of the affair." ...|$|E
