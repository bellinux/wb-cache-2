5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. Malawach is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pan.</b> Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E

Convair 240s replaced DC-3s and other pre-war types on Pan Am's shorter flights in the Caribbean and South America. Pan Am also acquired a few Curtiss C-46s for a freight network that eventually extended to Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E
500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no {{more than a couple}} of tablespoons per [...] cups of oil" [...] used. This oil absorption rate is around the same as occurs with shallow frying, such as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Potato chips, {{also known}} as crisps in British English, are thin slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and {{additional}} varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853. Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin {{that they could not}} be eaten with a fork. As they could not be fried normally <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pan,</b> he decided to stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum's expectation, the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge's menu, and were known as [...] "Saratoga chips".|$|E
2500|$|A French dip {{sandwich}}, {{also known}} as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a [...] "French roll" [...] or baguette. It is usually served au jus ("with juice"), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both Philippe the Original's and Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet, two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> of au jus. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard. Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.|$|E
