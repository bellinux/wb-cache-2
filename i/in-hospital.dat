The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter <b>in-hospital</b> stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} is {{further complicated by}} the fact that the physicians staffing the SMUR units are among the lowest-paid in Europe. Although salaries have recently improved somewhat, in 2002 it was reported that these physicians who are, for the most part, full-time employees of public hospitals, had a starting salary of only €1300 (£833; $1278) per month. This economic reality has resulted in understandably high turnover and some difficulty in staffing positions. It has been suggested, however, that the recognition of emergency medicine as an <b>in-hospital</b> specialty in France and elsewhere in Europe is likely to result in the evolution of that system towards more comprehensive <b>in-hospital</b> emergency services.|$|E

The Libyan doctors concluded that the mass infections were more likely due to deliberate actions.|$|E
25|$|The care of acutely injured {{people in}} a public health system {{requires}} the involvement of bystanders, community members, health care professionals, and health care systems. It encompasses pre-hospital trauma assessment and care by emergency medical services personnel, emergency department assessment, treatment, stabilization, and <b>in-hospital</b> care among all age groups. An established trauma system network {{is also an important}} component of community disaster preparedness, facilitating the care {{of people who have been}} involved in disasters that cause large numbers of casualties, such as earthquakes.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, anesthesiologists' {{training}} is supervised by the respective national societies of anesthesiology {{as well as}} the Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI). In Scandinavia, anesthesiology is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields of anesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain control medicine, pre-hospital and <b>in-hospital</b> emergency medicine. Anesthesiologist in the Scandinavian countries is a doctor who has completed a six-year undergraduate training program (from medical school), a twelve-month internship, and a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts five training programs for anesthesiologists in Scandinavia. These are Intensive care, Pediatric anesthesiology and intensive care, Advanced pain medicine, Critical care medicine, and Advanced obstetric anesthesiology.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiologists provide {{medical care}} to {{patients}} in many different ways. During preoperative evaluation, {{in consultation with the}} surgical team, they create an anesthetic plan tailored for each individual patient taking into consideration the patient’s medical history and the type of surgical procedure planned. This may include invasive monitoring (TEE, CVP, arterial pressure), neuraxial nerve blocks (spinal or epidural), peripheral nerve blocks (selectively anesthetizing a specific part of the body), and/or various levels of sedation including reversible unconsciousness known as “General Anesthesia.” Anesthesiologists are acute care physicians and as such often provide intensive care techniques as they are the experts of airway management, intraoperative life support and provision of pain control, intraoperative diagnostic stabilization, and proper postoperative management of patients. An anesthesiologist's scope of practice also involves <b>in-hospital</b> and pre-hospital emergencies, work within intensive care units, acute pain units, and chronic pain consultations.|$|E
25|$|Thalamotomy, {{involving}} {{the creation of}} lesions in the brain region called the thalamus, is quite effective in treating patients with essential, cerebellar, or Parkinsonian tremor. This <b>in-hospital</b> procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient awake. After the patient’s head is secured in a metal frame, the surgeon maps the patient’s brain to locate the thalamus. A small hole is drilled through the skull and a temperature-controlled electrode is inserted into the thalamus. A low-frequency current is passed through the electrode to activate the tremor and to confirm proper placement. Once the site has been confirmed, the electrode is heated to create a temporary lesion. Testing is done to examine speech, language, coordination, and tremor activation, if any. If no problems occur, the probe is again heated to create a 3-mm permanent lesion. The probe, when cooled to body temperature, is withdrawn and the skull hole is covered. The lesion causes the tremor to permanently disappear without disrupting sensory or motor control.|$|E
500|$|In {{anticipation}} of liver transplantation (which {{may be associated}} with considerable <b>in-hospital</b> delay), several other strategies {{have been found to be}} beneficial in preserving kidney function. [...] These include the use of intravenous albumin infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of vasopressin, which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease pressure in the portal vein, dialysis, and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) or liver dialysis.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Arnold and James Holliman {{have criticized}} {{the use of these}} {{descriptors}} for emergency medical systems as an oversimplification and a needless source of controversy. Instead, Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other groupings be used, such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model. Specialty systems would include those with physicians dedicated to emergency medicine, whereas multidisciplinary systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from other disciplines to provide emergency care. Such an approach would seek to categorize pre-hospital care separately from <b>in-hospital</b> systems. Within Arnold and Holliman's understanding of emergency care models, there is also an acknowledgement that current Western models may be inadequate in the context of developing nations. For instance, a cost-benefit analysis [...] found that creating an EMS system in Kuala Lumpur that met U.S. standards for cardiac arrest response (85 percent of patients receive defibrillation within 6 minutes) would cost US$2.5 million and only save four neurologically intact lives per year. The primary variable responsible for that result is the relatively young demography of Kuala Lumpur, meaning that comparatively few cardiac-related deaths occur.|$|E

Osteopathic medical schools {{tend to have a}} stronger focus on primary care medicine than MD schools. DO schools have developed various strategies to encourage their graduates to pursue primary care, such as offering accelerated 3-year programs for primary care, focusing clinical education in community health centers, and selecting rural or under-served urban areas for the location of new campuses.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics {{have a close}} {{relationship}} with the physicians who (in most systems) grant paramedics the legal right to practice their profession with a regulated paramedic service. Some systems in Canada are transitioning to a self regulated organization, where medical authority dervies directly from legislation and self-regulation rather than the approval of a medical doctor. Also, because physician assistants in Canada exist primarily in the Canadian Forces, the role of clinical paramedic practitioners is under serious study. [...] Both urban and rural centres have begun utilizing paramedics working <b>in-hospital</b> on cardiac arrest teams, patient transfer teams, emergency department triage/treatment and to facilitate faster [...] "off-load" [...] times.|$|E

In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called Reach to Recovery, was formed. Later taken over by the American Cancer Society, it provided post-mastectomy, <b>in-hospital</b> visits from women who had survived breast cancer, who shared their own experiences, practical advice, and emotional support, but never medical information.

Three patients were documented to be in ventricular fibrillation. The duration of chest compression varied from less than 1minute to 65minutes. The JAMA article was very straightforward: chest compression buys time until the external defibrillator arrives on the scene. As the authors write in the article, [...] "Anyone, anywhere, can now initiate cardiac resuscitative procedures. All that is needed is two hands". However, respiration received relatively little attention in the 1960 JAMA article. Many of the patients had been intubated and thus the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was not necessary. It was not long however, before this newly discovered technique was used in conjunction with the longer held techniques of artificial respiration.|$|E
