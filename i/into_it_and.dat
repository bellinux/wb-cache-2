5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia aquilonia formed a clade with B.plagiocarpa, B.oblongifolia and B.robur, rather than B.integrifolia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> published B.subg.

5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth.

The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia ilicifolia and B.oligantha form a clade, that {{is they are}} each other's closest relative, with Banksia cuneata resolving as the next closest relative, suggesting a monophyletic B. subg. Isostylis; but the clade appears fairly derived (that it, it evolved relatively recently), suggesting that B.subg. Isostylis may not merit subgeneric rank. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> published B.subg.

5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which comprises Banksia and Dryandra. With respect to B.brownii, Mast's results are somewhat at odds with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges, finding it to be {{more closely related to}} B.nutans (nodding banksia) and B.quercifolia (oak-leaved banksia) than to many of the Spicigerae. Overall, the inferred phylogeny is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and provides compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons.

5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
