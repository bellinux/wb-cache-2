2500|$|Here, the {{required}} default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE-754 optional trapping and other [...] "alternate exception handling" [...] modes are not discussed). Arithmetic exceptions are (by default) {{required to be}} recorded in [...] "sticky" [...] status flag bits. That they are [...] "sticky" [...] means {{that they are not}} reset by the next (arithmetic) operation, but stay set until explicitly reset. The use of [...] "sticky" [...] flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine: without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation. By default, an operation always returns a result according to specification without interrupting computation. For instance, 1/0 returns +∞, while also setting the divide-by-zero <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> (this default of ∞ is designed so as to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored).|$|E
5000|$|Memory was {{accessed}} two decimal digits at {{the same}} time (even-odd digit pair for numeric data or one alphameric character for text data). Each decimal digit was 6 bits, composed of an odd parity Check bit, a <b>Flag</b> <b>bit,</b> and four BCD bits for the value of the digit in the following format: C F 8 4 2 1The <b>Flag</b> <b>bit</b> had several uses: ...|$|E

5000|$|Suppose {{that the}} status-byte 103 (decimal) is returned, and {{that within the}} status-byte we want to check the 5th <b>flag</b> <b>bit.</b> The flag of {{interest}} (literal bit-position 6) is the 5th one - so the mask-byte will be [...] ANDing the status-byte 103 ( [...] in binary) with the mask-byte 32 ( [...] in binary) evaluates to 32, our original mask-byte, which means the <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> is set; alternatively, if the flag-bit had not been set, this operation would have evaluated to 0.|$|E
50|$|IF (Interrupt Flag) is {{a system}} <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> in the x86 architecture's FLAGS register, which determines {{whether or not the}} CPU will handle {{maskable}} hardware interrupts.|$|E
5000|$|They {{were placed}} into special ROM cards that {{provided}} {{a few words of}} read/write memory, accessed indirectly {{through the use of a}} thirteenth <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> in each ROM word.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} IEEE 754 standard, however, {{failed to}} recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception <b>flag</b> <b>bits.</b> So while these were implemented in hardware, initially programming language implementations typically {{did not provide}} a means to access them (apart from assembler). Over time some programming language standards (e.g., C99/C11 and Fortran) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status <b>flag</b> <b>bits.</b> The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic <b>flag</b> <b>bits.</b> The programming model {{is based on a}} single thread of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a means outside of the standard (e.g. C11 specifies that the flags have thread-local storage).|$|R
5000|$|The core's Status {{register}} has Carry and Zero <b>flag</b> <b>bits.</b> Overflow and Negative, {{usually found}} in other cores, are not present.|$|R
5000|$|The {{processor}} maintains internal <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> (a status register), which {{indicate the}} results of arithmetic and logical instructions. The flags are: ...|$|R
50|$|An {{instruction}} cache requires only one <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> per cache row entry: a valid bit. The valid bit indicates {{whether or not}} a cache block has been loaded with valid data.|$|E
50|$|Currently, 3 of the 4 flag bits in {{the flags}} field (ff1) are defined; the most-significant <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> is {{reserved}} for future use. The other three flags are known as R, P and T.|$|E
50|$|The Wordmark, by contrast, {{is not a}} BCD character. Rather, it is a <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> used to {{mark the}} end of a word on some {{variable}} word length computers such as the IBM 1401.|$|E

50|$|Identifiers in {{the symbol}} table were {{represented}} in a 50-character alphabet, allowing a 36-bit word to represent 6 alphanumeric characters plus 2 <b>flag</b> <b>bits,</b> because 506 < 234.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science a segmented scan is modification of a prefix sum {{with an equal}} sized array of <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> to denote segment boundaries on which the scan should be performed.|$|R
50|$|The bytes that {{comprise}} the Apple II high-resolution screen buffer contain seven visible bits (each corresponding directly to a pixel) and a <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> used to select between purple/green or blue/orange colour sets. Each pixel, since it is represented by a single bit, is either on or off; there are no bits within the pixel itself for specifying colour or brightness. Colour is instead created as an artifact of the NTSC colour encoding scheme, determined by horizontal position: pixels with even horizontal coordinates are always purple (or blue, if the <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> is set), and odd pixels are always green (or orange). Two lit pixels {{next to each other}} are always white, regardless of whether the pair is even/odd or odd/even, and irrespective {{of the value of the}} <b>flag</b> <b>bit.</b> The foregoing is only an approximation of the true interplay of the digital and analog behavior of the Apple's video output circuits on one hand, and the properties of real NTSC monitors on the other hand. However, this approximation is what most programmers of the time would have in mind while working with the Apple's high-resolution mode.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} B5000, a <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> in each control or numeric word was {{set aside to}} identify the word as a control word or numeric word. This was partially a security mechanism to stop programs {{from being able to}} corrupt control words on the stack.|$|E
5000|$|The 8086 has no {{instruction}} to directly set or reset the trap flag. These operations are done by pushing the flag register on the stack, changing the trap <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> {{to what the}} programmer wants it to be, and then popping the flag register back off the stack.The instructions to set the trap flag are: ...|$|E
50|$|Each {{audio sample}} (of up to 24 bits) is {{combined}} with four <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> and a synchronisation preamble which is four time slots long to make a subframe of 32 time slots.|$|R
50|$|The {{data block}} (cache line) {{contains}} the actual data fetched {{from the main}} memory. The tag contains (part of) {{the address of the}} actual data fetched from the main memory. The <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> are discussed below.|$|R
50|$|A status register, flag register, or {{condition}} code register {{is a collection}} of status <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> for a processor. An example is the FLAGS register of the x86 architecture or flags in a program status word (PSW) register.|$|R
5000|$|The process starts when a security-aware {{resolver}} {{sets the}} [...] "DO" [...] ("DNSSEC OK") <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> in a DNS query. Since the DO bit {{is in the}} extended flag bits defined by EDNS, all DNSSEC transactions must support EDNS. EDNS support is also needed {{to allow for the}} much larger packet sizes that DNSSEC transactions require.|$|E
50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that {{condition}} code register (CCR) affects the decryption process. For example, an arithmetic operation in the main program having the 0 number as a result, will cause zero <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> to be set in CCR. This will cause the value in (SP) to be changed in the trace vector. This is also done to obfuscate against reverse engineering.|$|E
5000|$|Field <b>flag</b> (<b>bit</b> 35 for 29.97/30 frame/s, bit 75 for 25 frame/s): This is an {{additional}} least-significant bit for the frame number, distinguishing the two interlaced fields in one video frame. It is set to 0 during the first field of a frame, and to 1 during the second. This bit replaces the [...] "polarity correction" [...] bit in linear timecode.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "SQUOZE" [...] was {{borrowed}} from the scheme used in the SHARE 709 operating system for representing object code symbols; it packed six characters of a 50-character alphabet plus two additional <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> into one 36-bit word.|$|R
50|$|The two least-significant-bits of {{the second}} nibble of the first octet of the {{hexadecimal}} representation (i.e., the two least significant bits of the first octet) of the OUI are reserved as <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> for some protocols (e.g., 'M' bit and 'X' <b>bit),</b> <b>flags</b> to indicate whether the address {{is part of an}} individual (unicast) or group (multicast) address block (e.g., Individual / Group / G bit or Unicast / Multicast / M <b>bit),</b> <b>flags</b> to indicate whether an address is universally or locally administered (e.g., Universal / Local / L bit), etc., and should not contain the values 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,a, b,d, e, or f, unless these values reflect the true meaning of these <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> - if the organization that owns the OUI does set one of these bits when creating an identifier, then the value {{of the second}} nibble of the first octet changes accordingly in representations of the OUI (e.g., if the hexadecimal value of the second nibble of the first octet is 'C' and the least-significant-bit is set, then the value becomes 'D').|$|R
5000|$|Usage: Describes, with a {{collection}} of <b>flag</b> <b>bits,</b> how the resource will be used by the application. These flags dictate which resources are used in dynamic or static access patterns. Static resource values don't change after being loaded, whereas dynamic resource values may be modified.|$|R
50|$|The {{instructions}} LD A,R and LD A,I {{affect the}} Z80 flags register, unlike {{all the other}} LD (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set {{according to the data}} loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow <b>flag</b> (<b>bit</b> 2) is set according to {{the current state of the}} IFF2 flip-flop.|$|E
5000|$|Transmitting and {{receiving}} UARTs must be {{set for the}} same bit speed, character length, parity, and stop bits for proper operation. The receiving UART may detect some mismatched settings and set a [...] "framing error" [...] <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> for the host system; in exceptional cases the receiving UART will produce an erratic stream of mutilated characters and transfer them to the host system.|$|E
50|$|Cell Loss Priority (CLP) is a <b>flag</b> <b>bit</b> in the ATM cell header {{that determines}} the {{probability}} of a cell being discarded if the network becomes congested. Cells where the CLP = 0 are insured traffic and unlikely to be dropped. Cells with CLP = 1 are best-effort traffic, which may be discarded in congested conditions in order to free up resources to handle insured traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{meaning of}} various <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> (such as S=1 enables setting the {{condition}} codes) {{is identical to}} the ARM instruction set. The load/store multiple instruction can only access half of the register set, depending on the H bit. If H=0, the 16 bits indicate R0-R15; if H=1, R16-R31.|$|R
5000|$|M <b>Flag</b> (1 <b>bit)</b> : 1 {{means more}} {{fragments}} follow; 0 means last fragment.|$|R
50|$|A data cache {{typically}} requires two <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b> per {{cache line}} a valid bit and a dirty bit. Having a dirty bit set {{indicates that the}} associated cache line has been changed since it was read from main memory ("dirty"), meaning that the processor has written data to that line and the new value has not propagated {{all the way to}} main memory.|$|R
