40|$|The icing characteristics, the {{de-icing}} {{rate with}} hot air, {{and the effect}} of impact ice on fuel metering and mixture distribution have been determined in a laboratory investigation of that part of the engine induction system consisting of a three-barrel injection-type carburetor and a supercharger housing with spinner-type fuel injection from an 18 -cylinder radial engine used on a large twin-engine cargo airplane. The induction system remained ice-free at carburetor-air temperatures above 36 F regardless of the moisture content of the air. Between carburetor-air temperatures of 32 F and 36 F with <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> in excess of saturation, serious throttling ice formed in the carburetor because of expansion cooling of the air; at carburetor-air temperatures below 32 F with <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> in excess of saturation, serious impact-ice formations occurred, Spinner-type fuel injection {{at the entrance to the}} supercharger and heating of the supercharger-inlet elbow and the guide vanes by the warn oil in the rear engine housing are design features that proved effective in eliminating fuel-evaporation icing and minimized the formation of throttling ice below the carburetor. Air-flow recovery time with fixed throttle was rapidly reduced as the inlet -air wet -bulb temperature was increased to 55 F; further temperature increase produced negligible improvement in recovery time. Larger ice formations and lower icing temperatures increased the time required to restore proper air flow at a given wet-bulb temperature. Impact-ice formations on the entrance screen and the top of the carburetor reduced the over-all fuel-air ratio and increased the spread between the over-all ratio and the fuel-air ratio of the individual cylinders. The normal spread of fuel-air ratio was increased from 0. 020 to 0. 028 when the left quarter of the entrance screen was blocked in a manner simulating the blocking resulting from ice formations released from upstream duct walls during hot-air de-icing...|$|R

The experiments were conducted at simulated glide power, low cruise power, and normal rated power through a range of <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and air temperatures at approximately sea-level pressure. Induction-system icing was found to occur within approximately the same limits as those established by the previous laboratory investigation after making suitable allowances for the difference in fuel volatility and throttle angles. Rough operation of the engine was experienced when ice caused a marked reduction in the air flow.

Exergy efficiencies are derived as functions of heat and mass transfer parameters.

As a result, this work is intended not only to demonstrate the usefulness of exergy analysis in thermodynamic assessments of drying processes, but also to provide insights into their performances and efficiencies. It is believed that the present model should be useful to people seeking (i) to optimize the design of drying systems and their components and (ii) to identify appropriate applications and optimal configurations for drying systems.

40|$|The risk {{assessment}} regarding overheating in underground structures is becoming quite common among the designers, when internal heat gains are severe or they occur {{for a long}} time. Typical {{is the case of}} subway tunnel networks, but many other recent examples may be easily found. Quite often however, not only the air temperature pattern is relevant, but also humidity may play an important role, especially if underground water infiltrations are not negligible. In fact, water evaporation or condensation may significantly affect the temperature profiles; on the other hand, high <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> may hamper some activities performed in the cavities. 	The present paper aims to present a design tool to simulate the hygro-thermal behaviour of ventilated underground cavities.

A forced convection scheme with a complex flow field, two dimensional arrays of circular jets with crossflow, was utilized with <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> (mass ratio of water vapor to air) up to 0. 23. The dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat of air, steam and air/steam mixtures are examined. Methods for determining gaseous mixture properties from the properties of their pure components are reviewed as well as methods for determining these properties with good confidence. The need for more experimentally determined property data for humid air is discussed. It is concluded that dimensionless forms of forced convection heat transfer data and empirical correlations based on measurements with dry air may be applied to conditions involving humid air with the same confidence as for the dry air case itself, provided that the thermophysical properties of the humid air mixtures are known with the same confidence as their dry air counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{recovery}} in one configuration {{of a direct}} contact counterflow, falling droplet heat exchanger (DCHX), from natural gas combustion products was evaluated in terms of sensible and latent effectiveness. Effectiveness was found for uniform and nonuniform water droplet streams, and high and low inlet gas <b>humidity</b> <b>ratios</b> over a range of droplet flow rates and inlet gas temperatures. A droplet generator was built and tested to characterize droplet uniformity under various operating conditions. Uniform droplets were produced by vibrating the droplet generator at a fixed frequency and amplitude. Results agree well with those predicted by Rayleigh's theory on the instability of liquid jets.

This model was extended to include the effects of humidity. The {{results show that the}} extended model accurately computes the in-cylinder pressure history when varying the water fraction in air. Increasing the water vapor content in air decreases the peak pressure and temperature significantly, which increases the measured Knock Limited Spark Timing (KLST); at 4. 3 g H 2 O/kg dry air the KLST is 19 °CA BTDC while at 11 g H 2 O/kg dry air the KLST is 21 °CA BTDC for the same fuel. Excellent agreement is observed between the calculated knock resistance (using the Propane Knock Index, PKI) and the measured knock resistance (KLST) for the range in water content in air studied in this work. Since the effect of water on autoignition delay time is negligible, the observed increase in knock resistance of the fuel-air mixture is due a decrease in pressure and temperature of the end gas with increasing water content in as a result of changes in the mass burning rate, and thermophysical properties of the fuel-air mixture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Atmospheric {{analysis}} by open-path Fourier-transform infrared (OP/FT-IR) spectrometry has been possible {{for over two}} decades but has not been widely used because {{of the limitations of}} the software of commercial instruments. In this paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art of the hardware and software that constitutes a contemporary OP/FT-IR spectrometer. We then describe advances that have been made in our laboratory that have enabled many of the limitations of this type of instrument to be overcome. These include not having to acquire a single-beam background spectrum that compensates for absorption features in the spectra of atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide. Instead, an easily measured “short path-length” background spectrum is used for calculation of each absorbance spectrum that is measured over a long path-length. To accomplish this goal, the algorithm used to calculate the concentrations of trace atmospheric molecules was changed from classical least-squares regression (CLS) to partial least-squares regression (PLS). For calibration, OP/FT-IR spectra are measured in pristine air over a wide variety of path-lengths, temperatures, and <b>humidities,</b> <b>ratioed</b> against a short-path background, and converted to absorbance; the reference spectrum of each analyte is then multiplied by randomly selected coefficients and added to these background spectra. Automatic baseline correction for small molecules with resolved rotational fine structure, such as ammonia and methane, is effected using wavelet trans-forms. A novel method of correcting for the effect of the nonlinear response of mercury cadmium telluride detectors is also incorporated. Finally, target factor analysis may be used to detect the onset of a given pollutant when its concentration exceeds a certain threshold. In this way, the concentration of atmospheric species has been obtained from OP/FT-IR spectra measured at intervals of 1 min over a period of many hours with no operator intervention.
