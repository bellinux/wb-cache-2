25|$|The {{donation}} of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> something as well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Philippousis said: [...] "It {{was just}} about playing one event. There’s no talk about a comeback. Down the line if I see something, maybe close to California, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> that. It’s one event and that’s it." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is {{referred}} to as [...] "obligation". [...] "There are moments for all of us when we care quite naturally. We just do care; no ethical effort is required. 'Want' and 'ought' are indistinguishable in such cases." [...] I have the ability to [...] "abstain from action if I [...] believe that anything <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> would tend to work against {{the best interests of the}} cared-for." [...] According to Noddings we are obligated to pursue the [...] "musts".|$|E

60|$|SMITH: Well, perhaps, {{not quite}} so much as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done.</b> Such {{a lot of things}} to do this term. Cricket, for instance.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this, members of certain deathcore bands {{do not take}} a liking to being labeled [...] "deathcore". In an interview with vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain about the deathcore label, he said [...] "Deathcore is the new nu-metal. [...] It sucks. And if anyone calls us 'deathcore' then <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> something very bad to them." [...] While {{in an interview with}} Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said [...] "You know, I really hate that term. I know we've been labeled as that but I think there's so much more to our music than just a mixture of death metal and hardcore (sic) even though we incorporate those elements in our music. To me it seems that is just the new and fresh thing that kids are following." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Post {{wrote that}} the lyrics [...] "express {{emotions}} ranging from the flip to the resigned". Sharan Shetty of Slate stated that the song is about [...] "heartbreak and redemption", while a Yahoo! News reviewer noted that it is about [...] "personal travails and confusion". Nora Crotty of Elle magazine described the single as an [...] "ode to repenting {{in the morning for}} the foolish mistakes you made the night before". Billboards Vena stated that a [...] "plucky acoustic guitar" [...] accompanies Rihanna's vocals while she sings the lines, [...] "I think I've had enough/ Might get a little drunk/ I say what's on my mind/ <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> a little time. Cause all of my kindness/ Is taken for weakness." [...] After the first chorus West sings, [...] "Woke up an optimist/ Sun was shining, I'm positive/ Then I heard you was talking trash/ Hold me back/ I'm about to spazz." [...] On the second chorus, he and Rihanna harmonize as they sing, [...] "Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'/ And we got three more days 'till Friday/ I'm just trying to make it back home by Monday morning." [...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone. McCartney's lyrics were improvised mid-performance and are for the most part drowned out by West's vocals except for the lines [...] "We can run around" [...] and [...] "How 'bout a mystery" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Still," [...] said Carrie, with a half-wistful {{sense of}} regret {{she could not}} wholly drive out, [...] "the time when <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> so has gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Mary; 'I {{should like}} it better afterwards. Do you think <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> one copy for you? Or {{would it not}} suit Lord Ormersfield?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can but try it," [...] said Mr. Polly towards tea time. [...] "When there's {{nothing else}} on hand I suppose <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> {{a bit of}} fishing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if I got drunk, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> anything," [...] I said {{cool and}} hard now. [...] "Cut off your {{beautiful}} chestnut hair for bracelets for my arms." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'If Percy and Theodora had {{not been}} reconciled, <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> so. It did seem {{a long time to}} go on in doubt whether I had acted for her happiness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I'm spoiling yours, too," [...] he answered. [...] "I'm {{not worth}} it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> {{something}} to win you and keep you. I'm {{not going to}} do much without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The fault {{was mine}} {{no less than}} yours. Mark has told me so today, and I have known it long; though not so long as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done.</b> Mary, my love, come here.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't {{say that}} at all, mamma. I think I have done uncommonly well. Indeed I know I have. But then if {{everything}} had not been upset, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> so much better." ...|$|R
