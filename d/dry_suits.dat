5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the audience would not see it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> for {{recreational}} diving {{are made in}} both membrane and neoprene, and primarily differ from surface <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> in that they have inflation and deflation air valves to maintain neutral buoyancy, and may be slightly more durable.|$|E

25|$|Surface <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> {{users can}} face a similar {{inversion}} problem. The problem is more acute when {{not wearing a}} personal flotation device (life vest) over the <b>dry</b> <b>suit.</b> For surface <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> users, the inversion can be much more critical if no one is nearby to assist, since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, and may also have water run down into their nose while inverted.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are often}} worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These <b>dry</b> <b>suits,</b> which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b> They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> are {{equipped}} with an inflation valve {{and at least one}} exhaust valve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> provide passive thermal protection: They {{insulate}} against {{heat transfer}} to the environment. When this is insufficient, active warming or cooling may be provided, usually by a hot-water suit, which is a wetsuit with a supply of heated or chilled water from the surface, {{but it is also}} possible to provide chemical or electrically powered heating accessories to <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other factors predisposing to {{immersion}} hypothermia include dehydration, inadequate rewarming between repetitive dives, {{starting a}} dive while wearing cold, wet <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> undergarments, sweating with work, inadequate thermal insulation (for example, thin <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> undergarment), and poor physical conditioning.|$|R

25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are also}} worn by rescue {{personnel}} who must enter, or may accidentally enter, cold water.

They may also be optimized for a specific task such as ice rescue, or helicopter rescue swimmer.|$|E

25|$|Membrane <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are made}} from thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
25|$|Surface <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> do not {{normally}} have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> pose {{their own}} unique {{problems}} compared to wet suit diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage and adjust the air volume inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, {{in order to prevent}} over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent. Most modern <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem when properly set.|$|E
25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b> These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on <b>dry</b> <b>suits,</b> as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
