5000|$|A plate reverb {{system uses}} an {{electromechanical}} transducer, {{similar to the}} driver in a loudspeaker, to create vibrations in a large plate of sheet metal. The plate’s motion is picked up {{by one or more}} contact microphones whose output is an audio signal which may be added to the original [...] "dry" [...] signal. In the late 1950s, Elektro-Mess-Technik (EMT) introduced the EMT 140; a 600 lb model popular in recording studios, contributing to many hit records such as Beatles and Pink Floyd albums recorded at Abbey Road Studios in the 1960s, and others recorded by Bill Porter in Nashville's RCA Studio B. Early units had one pickup for mono output, and later models featured two pickups for stereo use. The reverb time can be adjusted by a <b>damping</b> <b>pad,</b> made from framed acoustic tiles. The closer the <b>damping</b> <b>pad,</b> the shorter the reverb time. However, the pad never touches the plate. Some units also featured a remote control.|$|E

40|$|Machining is {{a complex}} process in which many {{variables}} can deleterious the desired results. Among them, cutting tool vibration is the most critical phenomenon which influences dimensional precision of the components machined, functional behavior of the machine tools and life of the cutting tool. In a machining operation, the cutting tool vibrations are mainly influenced by cutting parameters like cutting speed, depth of cut and tool feed rate. In this work, the cutting tool vibrations are controlled using a <b>damping</b> <b>pad</b> made of Neoprene. Experiments were conducted in a CNC lathe where the tool holder is supported with and without <b>damping</b> <b>pad.</b> The cutting tool vibration signals were collected through a data acquisition system supported by LabVIEW software. To increase the buoyancy and reliability of the experiments, a full factorial experimental design was used. Experimental data collected were tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA) to understand the influences of the cutting parameters. Empirical models have been developed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Experimental studies and data analysis have been performed to validate the proposed damping system. Multilayer perceptron neural network model has been constructed with feed forward back-propagation algorithm using the acquired data. On {{the completion of the}} experimental test ANN is used to validate the results obtained and also to predict the behavior of the system under any cutting condition within the operating range. The onsite tests show that the proposed system reduces the vibration of cutting tool to a greater extend...|$|E

40|$|The {{accelerator}} and beamline {{components of}} the APS have stringent vibration criteria {{in order to meet}} the beam stability requirements. For instance, the vibration amplitude of the storage ring quadrupoles is restricted to 0. 11 {mu}m (rms) over a frequency range of 4 [...] 50 Hz. <b>Damping</b> <b>pads,</b> consisting of thin viscoelastic f`ilms sandwiched between stainless steel plates, have been designed for passive vibration damping. Results presented in this paper show that the <b>damping</b> <b>pads</b> under the storage ring girder-magnet assemblies reduced the vibration amplification factor Q from over 100 to 8. The broad band rms motion of the magnets was reduced by a factor of 2. 5 to 3. Preliminary results for a monochromator housing show a potential use of such <b>damping</b> <b>pads</b> for vibration control of beamline components. Radiation and creep effects on the damping pads` performance are considered...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{modeling}} and controller {{design for the}} Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). A dynamic model of the RMS is derived using Book's recursive Lagrangian method. This model has six degree-of-freedom rigid dynamics, joint flexibility dynamics, link transverse elastic dynamics and torsional elastic dynamics. A computationally efficient control approach for addressing joint and boom flexibility of the RMS is investigated. The control strategy consists essentially of four parts. The first part involves pre-shaping the joint trajectories {{in order to reduce}} the excitation of link flexibility. The second part is a rigid model based inverse dynamics control which is used to obtain the desired joint torque. The third part is a flexible-joint control loop which is based on a perturbation technique. The last part is a pulse active <b>damping</b> (<b>PAD)</b> control loop which is applied to damp out the system residual vibrations in a fast manner. The integrated control strategy leads to fast end-effector trajectory tracking with less end-effector vibration and fast damping of residual vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Beam {{stability}} {{is a major}} concern for the operation of the APS. One of the many contributing factors to electron-beam in{{stability is}} mechanical vibration of the accelerator components especially the focusing magnets. The electron beam should be stable to 5 % of its rms size to maintain the specified photon beam stability. The APS uses steel girders to support the conventional magnets and vacuum chambers in the storage ring (SR). Three pedestal and jack assemblies support the girders. <b>Damping</b> <b>pads</b> are presently installed between the pedestals and the jacks. These <b>damping</b> <b>pads</b> {{have been shown to be}} very effective in reducing the fundamental girder-vibration mode. The horizontal vibration levels of the SR quadrupole magnets are presently within specification at between two and four times the ground motion, i. e., 50 - 100 nm rms (4 - 50 Hz). Future improvements to the APS beam quality would require a further reduction in girder vibration. Several options for reducing the vibration of the girders and magnets are discussed, and the measurement results are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The player {{must pay}} close {{attention}} to the damper pedal to play cleanly and avoid multiple notes ringing unintentionally at the same time. Because the notes ring for a significant fraction of a second when struck with the <b>damper</b> <b>pad</b> up, and ringing bars do not stop ringing immediately when contacted by the pad, players use a technique called after pedaling. [...] In this technique, the player presses the damper pedal slightly after striking the bar—shortly enough so the recently struck note continues to ring, but long enough so that the previous note stops ringing.|$|R

5000|$|Typically, {{residential}} and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, {{and can be}} described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides. Air is moved by a centrifugal fan or blower, (usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as [...] "sheaves" [...] in HVAC terminology, or a direct-driven axial fan), and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads. The cooling units can be mounted on the roof (down draft, or downflow), or exterior walls or windows (side draft, or horizontal flow) of buildings. To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit's sides and through the <b>damp</b> <b>pads.</b> Heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened to continue the cooling process. Then cooled, moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall.|$|R
50|$|The Cembalet is an {{electro-mechanical}} piano requiring amplification {{to produce}} a usable sound level. Cembalets have 61 keys and a keyboard range of C2 to C7 (65.4 Hz - 2093 Hz). The Cembalet had ground stainless steel reeds and a pick-up using variable capacitance. The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to {{return it to the}} rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a plectrum and <b>damper</b> <b>pad</b> can be mounted {{at the end of a}} tuned spring steel reed. This plectrum lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Cembalet comes from the resistance of the steel reeds until they reach their point of release.|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of evaporative cooling using porous mate-rials {{is nothing new}} and goes well back into ancient times. Even nowadays porous containers are used to have fresh water available in hot and dry places like Spain or Egypt Evaporative cooling systems may be classified into di-rect and indirect. Direct evaporative cooling introduces moisture into the supply air. Indirect systems produce cooling without adding moisture to supply air by using a heat exchanger between two separate airflows. Achieve-ment of evaporative cooling of the air stream has been effected by passing air through <b>damp</b> <b>pads</b> (Hicks, N. G. et al. 1991), passing it through falling water (Gillet, A. C., et al. 1991), or spraying into the air stream (Bow-man, N. et al. 1997). The aims of this project, besides the adaptation of an evaporative cooling system to the specific architecture of a building, are to bring the evaporative cooling sys-tems closer to the general public...|$|R
40|$|Sources of {{transverse}} beam {{motion in the}} APS storage ring have been investigated for ground-motion- and water-system-induced vibrations of the magnet and vacuum systems, and for power supply ripple. The displacement of magnets in a bandwidth of 4 - 30 Hz have been reduced significantly by inserting viscoelastic <b>damping</b> <b>pads</b> between the girder supports and pedestals, and by welding the magnet cooling headers to {{the ceiling of the}} storage ring tunnel. Current ripple on magnet power supplies was identified as a source of horizontal beam motion. Beam motion was measured without the closed-orbit feedback system activated. At {beta}{sub x} = 15. 4 m and {beta}{sub y} = 10. 4 m the rms beam motion in the 0. 02 - 30 Hz band was 22. 7 {mu}m and 6. 3 {mu}m in the horizontal and verticle planes, respectively.

40|$|International audienceViscoElastic Materials (VEM) are intensively used {{to solve}} NVH issues. <b>Damping</b> <b>pads</b> and anti flutter {{products}} reduce the structure borne noise. Sealants and absorbing materials prevent the air borne transmission. Adhesives are common solutions to assemble parts. Whereas VEM are well known, the {{finite element analysis}} of their dynamic behavior is not straightforward.

The paper tackles the way how advanced capabilities are introduced in Code_Aster to take into account frequency dependent properties of VEM. The computing of frequency response functions and modes of vibration (real or complex) is addressed. Having frequency dependent modes is a step forward for the modal projection method and for the model updating with an experimental modal basis as a reference.

40|$|An {{optimization}} study for brake squeals aims {{to minimize the}} strain energy of vibrating pads with constrained layerdamping. To achieve this, using finite element method and experiments were operated and assumed-coupling mode methodwas used to solve it. The integrated global strain energy of the pad over a frequency range of interesting mode was calculated. Parametric studies were then performed to identify those dominant parameters on the vibration response of the <b>damped</b> <b>pad.</b> Moreover, the proposed methodology was employed {{to search for the}} optimum of the position/geometry of the constrainedlayer damping patch. Optimal solutions are given and discussed for different cases where the strain energy of the pad over afrequency range is covering the first bending mode and with the inclusion of the restriction of minimum damping materialutilization. As a result, the integrated strain energy is then performed to identify and optimize the position and geometry of thedamping shim. The optimization of the constrained layer damping for strain energy minimization of vibrating pads depend onthe position of the shape of the damping patch. These data can guide to specify the position of the constrained layer dampingpatch under pressure conditions...|$|R

The containers used for the termite test were acrylic cylinders (80  mm in diameter and 60  mm in height), the lower ends of which were sealed with a 5 -mm-thick hard dental plaster (New Plastone, GC Corp.). Test specimen was set {{at the center of the}} plaster bottom of the test container. A total of 150 worker termites and 15 soldiers collected from a laboratory termite colony at Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH), Kyoto University, were introduced into each test container.

The {{synchronously}} reduced {{damping coefficient}} {{in the current}} analysis was developed in equations (35) —(51) with v equal to the shaft rotational speed co, and is nondimen-sionalized according to equation (34). Figure 5 shows the com-parison of the nondimensional synchronously reduced damp-ing coefficient C{t versus (1 - hp) from Lund's analysis with the current approach. The agreement is good, further confirming Lund's trend showing decreased <b>damping</b> with decreased <b>pad</b> stiffness. Similar agreement was observed in the synchronously reduced stiffness coefficient and the load bear-ing capacity. Summary and Conclusions A method of incorporating pad flexibility effects, without the usual beam assumptions, into isothermal tilting pad bear-ing analysis has been developed. The method uses two-dimensional finite elements to determine pad deformations due to fluid film pressures. The pad assembly approach is ex-tended to include single pad deformations, thereby eliminating iterations on the individiual pad angles in the assembled bear-ing analysis. The pad deformations are represented by a single degree of freedom, {{the change in the}} pad radius of curvature, thus the current method is an approximate approach. A method of calculating frequency reduced coefficients is presented. Synchronously reduced coefficients are in agree-ment with previous curved beam approximate methods as well as more rigorous iterative approach. The finite element pad model employed here provides more versatility in modeling circumferential nonuniform pad cross sections and the skewed and distributed boundary conditions which occur at the pivot-pad interfaces...|$|R
