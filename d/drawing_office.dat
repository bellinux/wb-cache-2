5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on the one at Forceville that {{was selected as the}} prototype for all that followed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for {{the future}} of the Spitfire, many of the {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area. To this end, the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent's Garage in Station Square Reading, which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages, and Anna Valley Motors, Salisbury, which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, as well as producing other components. A purpose-built works, specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham in Reading. The <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E
25|$|These {{dates are}} {{somewhat}} debatable, since a lengthy period could pass between Gill creating a design and it being finalised by the Monotype <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team (who {{would work out}} many details such as spacing) and cut into metal. In addition, some designs such as Joanna were released to fine printing use long before they became widely available from Monotype.|$|E
50|$|In 1849, Henshaw {{was offered}} the post of {{assistant}} engineer {{on the construction of}} the James River and Kanawha Canal, Virginia, and in charge of the divisional <b>drawing</b> <b>offices.</b> From 1852 to 1854 inclusive, he was engaged on the Chicago Water Works and various Railway Surveys in Illinois and Michigan. From 1854 to 1856 on the New York and Erie Railway, and from 1857 to 1859 was resident Engineer on the Trois Pistoles section of the Grand Trunk Railway.|$|R
50|$|Many {{copies of}} {{technical}} drawings {{may be required}} {{in the construction of}} a project. Reproductions must be accurate as to size and shape, but for many purposes need not be permanent. The blueprint process was first used for mechanical reproduction of drawings. <b>Drawing</b> <b>offices</b> may use diazo or whiteprint processes. Where the volume of drawings reproduced justifies the cost of the machine, a large format photocopier using xerography can reproduce drawings at lower cost than re-plotting them.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{moved to}} a new yard at the former Fairfield Farm at the Govan riverside in 1864, changing its name to the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, after the old farm, in 1886, at which time it was owned by Sir William Pearce. The shipyard's imposing red sandstone <b>Drawing</b> <b>Offices</b> were designed by John Keppie of Honeyman and Keppie, with help from a young Charles Rennie Macintosh, and built 1889-91. The sculpted figures (The Engineer and the shipwright) flanking the entrance are by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray.|$|R
25|$|In April 1872, {{at the age}} of eighteen, Caine {{was back}} home in Liverpool where he set about {{applying}} his knowledge, gained working in the <b>drawing</b> <b>office,</b> into articles on architectural subjects, and subsequently published in the Builder and Building News. These were Caine’s first works published for a national audience. The articles caught Ruskin’s attention and he wrote words of encouragement to Caine.|$|E
25|$|On 5 July 1960 a fire {{during the}} night {{destroyed}} much of {{the eastern end of}} the Cockcroft Building. The damage included the <b>drawing</b> <b>office,</b> many student's and staff's results and files and the control room for the 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The 600 kV accelerator though only water damaged had to be scrapped. Refurbishment of the burnt out area was completed in September 1961.|$|E
25|$|During the {{war years}} Brighton works built {{more than half of}} Bulleid's Q1 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives, and the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> was {{primarily}} responsible for the detailed designs of his revolutionary Merchant Navy 4-6-2 express passenger locomotives, although the locomotives were built at Eastleigh Works. From 1943 they built 93 of the LMS Stanier 8F type 2-8-0 freight locomotives for the War Department, at the incredible rate of one every 4.5 days.|$|E

500|$|Designed at the <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> of Derby Works, the {{new class}} was {{constructed}} at British Railways' Crewe Works between 1951 and 1952. [...] The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but {{such was the}} immediacy of demand regarding a smaller version of the Britannias that a batch of 10 was rushed through construction before teething problems had been ironed out at the British Railways testing station at Rugby. No more were constructed due to the steel shortages of the 1950s, and onset of the British Railways Modernisation Plan from 1954.|$|R
50|$|The building, {{now known}} as Titanic Belfast, was {{expected}} to attract 425,000 visitors annually, of whom between 130,000-165,000 would come from outside Northern Ireland. It is intended to serve a similar transformational function {{to that of the}} Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, as a focus for the regeneration of the city. It forms part of the Titanic-related heritage sites in Titanic Quarter, including the disused headquarters and <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> of Harland & Wolff, the SS Nomadic - the last surviving White Star Line ship - and Hamilton Dock, Titanics Dock and Pump house and the Titanic and Olympic slipways.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Handley Page {{developed}} a new fast short-range regional airliner, intended to replace the venerable Douglas DC-3, particularly in third-world countries. The design, originally known as the HPR-3 Herald, emanated from the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> at Handley Page (Reading) Limited—the former Miles Aircraft factory site, which had developed an earlier airliner design, the Miles Marathon. The Herald was an extensive re-development of the original concept of the Marathon, notable for its high mounted wing. The HP Reading division succeeded in producing a modern design with excellent flight and performance characteristics. However, the company made a serious misjudgement which was, in the end, to cost the company dearly, and like some other classic British aircraft of the time, the Herald missed its chance.|$|E
25|$|At Harland and Wolff, {{he began}} with {{three months in}} the joiners' shop, {{followed}} by {{a month in the}} cabinetmakers' and then a further two months working on the ships. The last eighteen months of his five-year apprenticeship were spent in the <b>drawing</b> <b>office.</b> In 1901, Andrews, after working his way up through the many departments of the company, became the manager of the construction works. That same year, he also {{became a member of the}} Institution of Naval Architects. In 1907, Andrews was appointed the managing director and head of the drafting department at Harland and Wolff. During his long years of apprenticeship, study, and work, Andrews had become well liked in the company and amongst the shipyard's employees.|$|E
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the spring brackets, {{had one or}} more further batches of Class 7 Standard Pacifics been built to complete the intended 91 engines, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary BR Standard Class 8 Duke of Gloucester and that drawn up by Derby <b>Drawing</b> <b>Office</b> for the 2nd batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics. [...] This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on cast steel [...] "sub-frames" [...] carrying the spring brackets.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{practice}} of the SAR in the steam era was to design locomotives in their own <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> and to then {{go out and find}} a builder. The drawing board work for the Class NG15 has been attributed to a Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Otavi Railway, a German engineer known in SWA as Mr. Peters, who was employed as a draughtsman by the SAR. Since the earlier trials with the Class NG5 locomotive, the sharpest curves on the Avontuur line had been eased and the experience gained in the process was taken into consideration during the design of the Class NG15.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} {{factories}} in Kingswood, Bristol (Douglas Ltd - formerly Douglas Motorcycles then Douglas Vespa and vehicle air brake equipment), Hobbs Automatic Transmissions(epicyclic gearbox), Westcode Semiconductors (now IXYS Corporation) The main factory was east of Foundry Lane, Signal & Automation design offices {{as well as}} Brake Engineering, <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> and design/test laboratories on island site shared with Hugh Baird & Sons, Maltsters and the Wiltshire Bacon Company. The Rectifier Design Department was at Derriads House, some design offices opposite the main factory site, other test & development laboratories beyond the semiconductor site at Avon House, north of the main factory site.|$|R
50|$|Even though STIP {{continued}} to win awards, {{the firm was}} seen as coasting on its reputation, failing to provide forward looking design and planning, and faced the danger of becoming simply a <b>drawing</b> production <b>office.</b>|$|R
500|$|After graduation, Inglis {{began work}} as an {{apprentice}} for the civil engineering firm of John Wolfe-Barry & Partners. [...] He worked as a draughtsman in the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> for several months before being placed with Alexander Gibb, who was acting as resident engineer on an extension to the Metropolitan District Railway between Whitechapel and Bow. Inglis {{was responsible for the}} design and supervision of all thirteen bridges on the route. [...] It was during this time that he began his lifelong study of vibration and its effects on materials, particularly bridges.|$|E
500|$|Developed by the Monotype <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team in Salfords, Surrey, led by Fritz Steltzer, {{the project}} veered {{away from a}} purely {{faithful}} revival towards a denser, more condensed design. This differentiated it from the other Janson revivals on the market. Nicholas commented [...] "I think it was Morison's take on Janson - made a little heavier and narrower to give improved legibility and economy." [...] Typesetting expert Yannis Haralambous wrote of being told by a Monotype manager that the typeface was designed particularly for sale in Germany [...] "to appeal {{to those who have}} a weakness for Fraktur" [...] (blackletter or 'Gothic' typefaces, still very popular in Germany in the 1930s). In its dense design it may be able to compliment blackletter well, and Morison in his article on Leipzig printing suggested that this might have been a motivation behind the original's design style. Ehrhardt's technical production followed Monotype's standard method of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team, led and trained by Steltzer, who Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. A wax-copy was made from these drawing, the wax-copy was used to produce a lead plate with the design. These plates were then used as a plan for machining metal punches to stamp matrices in the Benton-pantographs. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
500|$|A {{large amount}} of {{material}} {{about the development of}} Gill Sans survives in Monotype's archives and in Gill's papers. While the capitals (which were prepared first) resemble Johnston quite closely, the archives document Gill (and the <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team at Monotype's works in Salfords Surrey, who developed a final precise design and spacing) grappling with the challenge of creating a viable humanist sans-serif lower-case as well as an italic, which Johnston's design did not have. Gill's first draft proposed many slanting cuts on the ends of ascenders and descenders, looking less like Johnston than the released version did. Early art for the italic looked very different, with less of a slope and swash capitals. The final version did not use the calligraphic italic [...] "g" [...] Gill preferred in his serif designs Perpetua and Joanna, instead using a standard [...] "double-storey" [...] "g".|$|E
2500|$|The smaller railway {{companies}} {{combined to}} form the Eastern and Midlands railway in 1883. Later the line to Cromer Beach opened in 1887. The result was that Melton Constable, a small village that began as a parish with 19 houses, became a junction of four new railways lines connecting Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The facilities grew to cover [...] that were once farmland. The site included an erecting shop along with this two long 'workshops'. There was an iron foundry, gasworks for the village, <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> and accommodation. The site was also served by a small miniature railway {{like the one at}} Horwich and Crewe.|$|R
50|$|Changes {{were also}} needed in {{searchlight}} design and training, so a team was {{selected from the}} London Electrical Engineers {{to return to their}} Headquarters at 46 Regency Street and set up workshops, design and <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> to deal with the redesigns. This organisation became The Searchlight Experimental Establishment commanded by Captain P. Yorke, RE. (The Tyne Electrical Engineers (TEE) similarly took responsibility for the School of Electric Lighting at Gosport.) Technology and tactics developed to keep pace as the Germans replaced vulnerable airships with heavy bombers. New 90 cm and 120 cm electric searchlights and their sound locators were linked directly to the guns to provide early warning.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} locomotive {{works and}} <b>drawing</b> <b>offices</b> of the TVR {{were located in}} the West Yard of Cardiff Docks, co-located there so that use could {{be made of the}} local boiler makers skills. However, the TVR {{towards the end of the}} 19th century found it commercially advantageous to outsource the heavy industrialised work of building locomotives. Hence the West Yard facility became a heavy overhaul shop, something which the GWR on inheriting the TVR didn't change, as they had access to the Caerphilly railway works of the former-Rhymney Railway. The last locomotive to be built at West Yard was the power unit for No. 1 steam railcar, in 1903.|$|R
500|$|Inglis {{returned}} to Cambridge in 1918 and was appointed as the professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics (renamed Mechanical Sciences in 1934). On 25 March 1919, {{he was selected}} to head the Cambridge University Engineering Department as the successor of Hopkinson, {{who had died in}} an air crash the previous year. Though he made no radical changes, such as had occurred under his predecessors, under Inglis' supervision the department became the largest in the university {{and one of the best}} engineering schools in the world. [...] He was responsible for expanding the department to meet the increased post-war demand for engineers and for the move from its traditional home at Free School Lane. [...] Inglis acquired the [...] Scroope House on Trumpington Street for the department and constructed a [...] laboratory on the site by 1923, followed in 1931 by a structure containing lecture theatres and a <b>drawing</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gill Sans' {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the experienced <b>drawing</b> <b>office</b> team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school; they worked out many aspects of the final drawings including adaptations of the letters to different sizes and the spacing. The diagrams were then used as a plan for machining metal punches by pantograph to stamp matrices, which would be loaded into a casting machine to cast type. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs (some of which survive) from them to test overall balance of colour and spacing on the page, before completing the remaining characters. Walter Tracy, Rhatigan and Gill's biographer Malcolm Yorke have written that the drawing office's work has not been fully appreciated; Yorke described Gill as [...] "tactless" [...] in his claims that the design was [...] "as much as possible mathematically measurable... as little reliance as possible should be placed on the sensibility of the draughtsmen and others concerned in its machine facture".|$|E
