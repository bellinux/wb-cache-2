40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to {{identify}} the main trends and shortcomings of the remuneration policy in the budgetary sphere of Ukraine and develop proposals for its improvement. There determined the main problems of the remuneration policy in the budgetary sphere, including the low level and unsatisfactory wage differentiation, intersectoral imbalances in remuneration, rigid framework of a <b>unified</b> <b>tariff</b> net, lack of an objective methodology for assessing the complexity of duties and work of employees, and forming qualification groups for labor remuneration. It was determined that the reform of the minimum wage institution led to an increase in the leveling of the remuneration of employees of various categories and professional groups, which practically led to the destruction of the tariff remuneration system in the budgetary sphere. The necessity of reforming the policy of employee remuneration in the budgetary sphere is substantiated. There formulated directions for improving the tariff labor remuneration: construction of a <b>unified</b> <b>tariff</b> net based on flexible principles, formation of qualification groups for labor remuneration to develop a unified remuneration scale, development of a methodology for evaluating positions and jobs, and ensuring an objective pay gap between two related qualifying groups. With the aim of renewing the ratios for various categories and professional groups, it is important to reduce the gap between the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage. Prospects for further research should be the development of a methodology for evaluating positions and job for an objective comparison of the complexity of tasks and responsibilities of budgetary sector employees, substantiating qualification ratios in wages, forming indicators to determine the basic wages of employees within the developed ranges...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEffective sharing {{mechanisms}} of joint costs among beneficiaries {{of a project}} are a fundamental requirement for the sustainability of the project. Projects that are heterogeneous {{both in terms of}} the landscape of the area under development or the participants (users) lead to a more complicated set of allocation mechanisms than homogeneous projects. The analysis presented in this paper uses cooperative game theory to develop schemes for sharing costs and revenues from a project involving various beneficiaries in an equitable and fair way. The proposed approach is applied to the West Delta irrigation project. It sketches a differential two-part tariff that reproduces the allocation of total project costs using the Shapley Value, a well-known cooperative game allocation solution. The proposed differential tariff, applied to each land section in the project reflecting their landscape-related costs, contrasts the <b>unified</b> <b>tariff</b> that was proposed using the traditional methods in the project planning documents...|$|R

40|$|Main goal of my bachelor?s degree {{paper was}} {{comparative}} study of contemporary adjustment of inheritance tax in Great Britain and Czech Republic and herewith connec-ted prepared plans of Treasury for adjustment of the inheritance tax in CR. Firstly in my paper I aimed for classification of inheritance tax to the fiscal system. From this chapter arose that inheritance tax is according to general rules categorized as property taxes. In the next part I quoted authors dealing with meaning of inheritance tax. While studying this topic I concluded that even though inheritance tax contributes with smaller profit to public budget, it represents very important field in tax systems. In this paper is present description of historical and contemporary form of inheri-tance tax in which I tried to compare their present modifications and development. From these acquired information arise certain general characteristics of the modificati-ons. Contemporary form of inheritance tax in the Czech Republic is aimed at liberation of inheritance tax for kinsmen, whilst the inheritance tax in Great Britain is aimed at taxing of citizens with vast possessions. In next chapter I concentrate on newly arising modifications of inheritance tax in Czech Republic. One of the suggestions includes for example determination of <b>unified</b> <b>tariff.</b> Next suggestion that is debated by the Treasury is of categorizing the inheritance tax to corporate taxes which {{will be followed by}} termination of the law 357 / 1992.

40|$|Unlike Latin America, {{there have}} been no {{detailed}} estimates of capital flight or its determinants in Africa. The author addresses this problem and, using several concepts, provides"bands"or a"range"for capital flight in Nigeria. A significant proportion of capital flight can be estimated from recorded data in the balance of payments and debt statistics - but these estimates are {{only as good as the}} data are reliable. Significant amounts of capital flight, relative to external debt, took place between 1970 and 1989. Trade-faking was an important vehicle: exports were under-invoiced to the tune of about US $ 8. 1 billion and imports were over invoiced about US $ 6. 0 billion. Econometric analysis shows that the culprit to be domestic macroeconomic policy - in the form of inflation, exchange rate misalignment, fiscal deficit, and the lack of opportunities for profitable domestic investments - combined with the relative attractiveness of foreign investments. Eliminating distortions in the economy could minimize substantially externally held foreign claims and minimize capital flight. Among things that need to be done: (a) ensure that the nation's currency is not overvalued; (b) establish an integrated, <b>unified</b> <b>tariff</b> structure to reduce the rewards for trade-faking; (c) establish fiscal discipline, to maintain macroeconomic stability and reduce inflation; (d) ensure a positive real rate of interest - high enough to attract funds but not so high as to stifle investment initiatives; (e) adopt a realistic exchange rate determined by market forces; and (f) foster attitudinal changes that contribute positively to honest government.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} realisation among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that their attempts toward economic integration were lagging, with little tangible progress made in integrating their economies. This has become a matter of great concern, leading them to agree to bring forward their plans for a GCC customs union. Specifically, new targets were set for <b>unifying</b> customs <b>tariffs</b> at 5 percent by 2003, and introducing a single GCC currency by 2010. After examining the factors underlying renewed interest in integration, it is concluded that the tide of pluses and minuses associated with the formation of a customs/monetary union has shifted to the plus side. At the present time, a customs union would give the Gulf States greater leverage to attract foreign investors and accelerate economic reforms in the region to diversify and further stimulate their economies away from oil revenues...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Leopold Skulski had been active {{under the pressure}} of war preparation but was mainly occupied by internal issues. Foreign policy was {{under the control of the}} country’s leader, Marshal J. Piłsudski. The cabinet of Leopold Skulski had little roomfor maneuver, the expenses connected with the war campaign represented 60 % of the country’s total budget. Even though war orders had a very positive influence on industrial and agricultural output growth, the bulk of that output had been absorbed by the army, which automatically created problems in the open market. Similarly, the country’s foreign trade balance was significantly overloaded by the burden of military expenditure with inflation providing a source of solid revenue income for covering war expenses. The Skulski government tried to stabilize the internal balance; on 1 April 1920 it unified the various state treasury and taxation systems and on 29 April, it unified the country’s five currencies into a single currency. On 1 June, a <b>unified</b> railway <b>tariff</b> covering the whole country was introduced. During the activity of this government, parliament had to agree an eight hour working day and a 46 hour working week for the workers, as well as providing them with a social security system.

5000|$|Decision Belgrade City Assembly, GSP [...] "Belgrade" [...] is 1990. It {{became a}} public utility company, {{founded by the}} city. In the period 1990-1991, the GSP has {{achieved}} the best results. With a total of 1,393 vehicles, with average age of 4.5 years, the streets of Belgrade was at the peak was about 1,130 vehicles a day carrying about 2.5 million passengers. The crisis in the former Yugoslavia, which escalated {{in the second half}} of 1991, led to the introduction of economic sanctions by UN Security Council to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the influx of a large number of displaced persons in Belgrade. Investments in the purchase of new vehicles, spare parts and maintenance of the infrastructure was minimal. During 1993. year due to the inability of continuous maintenance of the public transport problems in the procurement of oil and tires, price growth, socialization transport a decline in the number of vehicles in traffic, so that at the end of the year only 400 vehicles were in operation. Some lines are eliminated or shortened. The function of public transport in Belgrade had been damaged.During 1994. and 1995. the GSP managed to raise the level of transportation, revitalization of the fleet to an average of 909 vehicles on weekdays.At the beginning of 1998. in public transport are included private transporters. Compared to the previous year, traffic was 127 vehicles less, along with a tendency of further decline. Ceased to exist <b>unified</b> <b>tariff</b> system and passed on ticketing in vehicles by the conductor. After the start of NATO attack on Yugoslavia countries on 24 March 1999, GSP [...] "Beograd" [...] transferred to work in the war, which meant the abolition or curtailment of a large number of lines. It went to the handling by the main road corridor has. In the aftermath of the aggression problem of lack of vehicle traffic and still remains present, so that during the year the average traffic was only 428 vehicles. The unfavorable situation continued in 2000. The outdated fleet, low technical condition of vehicles, lack of spare parts, frequent reduction of traffic due to fuel shortages are only part of the problem that led to the introduction of emergency measures by the Republic Government. After the introduction of emergency measures, purchased 15 trolleybuses and signed a contract to purchase new buses with the factory Ikarbus. Significant changes have taken place after the events of October 2000, when the city's new Government has opted for the revitalization of the GSP, as a holder of public transport system in Belgrade. A goal that is set before GSP [...] "Belgrade" [...] is to reach the level of the enterprise from the beginning of the nineties. By the end of the year were established almost all the lines that were in the time of war eliminated or shortened.

Today's GSP modern company with an average age of vehicles 4 years. Also introduced and integrated tariff system in which they entered the private carriers.|$|R
50|$|Central and South-East Europe is {{characterized}} by inadequate gas infrastructure, including lack of interconnections between the networks and insufficient storage. For historic reasons, most gas pipelines in Central and South-East Europe run east-west only, without the level of inter-connectivity found in the West of the European Union. These characteristics result in a fragmented and inefficient gas market and greater concerns over security of supply. Improving inter-connectivity, and allowing gas to be moved more easily to wherever it is needed, will make a major contribution towards improving security of supply. To realize NETS, the harmonization of energy policies and regulatory frameworks are required which is a sizable task for the energy policy makers of the participating countries. The states involved will provide the required regulatory framework to enable the NETS projects to be implemented. Implementation of the NETS project would create an unbundled regional transmission systems according to the EU gas market directive, pool transmission system operators into a single corporate framework, and establish a <b>unified</b> code and <b>tariff</b> system for the resulting network.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{markets and}} the pace of trading have changed {{dramatically}} over the last decade. Stock exchanges have replaced their traditional physical floors with electronic trading platforms. Most market participants now employ automated, algorithmic strategies, which {{are the focus of}} the present thesis. The thesis consists of introduction and three essays. In the first essay, I study the impact of algorithmic trading activity on market properties. The analysis is based on a proprietary dataset from NASDAQ OMX Nordic. The essay presents a method for causality identification that does not rely on exogenous events. Separating maker’s and taker’s activity provides the analysis of causality between traders and market properties. The results identify two-way causality from the activity of algorithmic liquidity providers to relative bid-ask spread and from bid-ask spread to the activity of algorithmic liquidity takers. In the second essay, I study the impact of trading fees on market properties and activity of traders using the natural experiment of <b>unifying</b> the <b>tariff</b> structure of the NASDAQ OMX Nordic exchange trading price lists. I test the hypothesis that if the change of the exchange fees is less than uncertainties of other trading costs (e. g. cost of future bid-ask spread), the impact of the change is economically insignificant. The third essay presents a quantitative approach to measure market efficiency, based on the waiting time distribution. Constructing mean-reverting portfolios of cross-listed stocks provides observation of inefficient states by divergence of price from its mean. The farther the price diverges from its mean, the quicker the mean-reversion is. The essay shows that the parameter of the waiting-time exponential distribution is a good indicator of market efficiency. The findings presented in the thesis have the potential to be of interest for investors, regulators, and policy makers internationally...|$|R
