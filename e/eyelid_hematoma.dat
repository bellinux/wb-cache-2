40|$|Objective: {{to collect}} medical data on women s boxing. Design: Cross-sectional and {{longitudinal}} study. Setting: Medical examinations requested by Italian laws. Participants: A retrospective {{study was conducted}} on all female boxing competitions in Italy from April 2001 to December 2007. Sixty-one amateur female boxers were evaluated longitudinally. Interventions: Retrospective study: all pre-/post-match medical reports were analyzed. Prospective study: Breast, gynaecologic, brain, eyes, ear, nose and throat examinations were carried out. Main Outcome Measurements: Retrospective study: any injury assessed before/after the match. Prospective study: health problems which {{could be related to}} boxing activity. Results: Retrospective study: data from 5600 examinations were collected. Pre-competition, a medical problem was recorded in 3 athletes (1 conjunctiva hyperemia, 1 zygomatic bruise, 1 <b>eyelid</b> <b>hematoma).</b> Post-competition, 51 / 2800 medical checks showed mild common injuries, such as, soft tissue facial lesions, epistaxis, and hand-wrist problems. Only one concussion was recorded with hospitalization (for a thorough evaluation). Another athlete was hospitalized for a nasal fracture. Prospective study: 2 fibroadenomas, 3 ovarian cysts, and 1 intramural uterine myoma were diagnosed. In 4 boxers non-specific electroencephalographic abnormalities were detected however with a normal brain MRI in 3 (the 4 th is still waiting for the radiologic procedure). Nasal septum deviation was common (42. 6...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the incidence of ocular hemorrhage in patients with and without diabetes after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Background. Ocular hemorrhage after thrombolysis has been reported rarely. However, there is concern that the risk is increased in patients with diabetes. In fact, diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy {{has been identified as}} a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy without clear evidence that these patients have an increased risk for ocular hemorrhage. Methods. We identified all suspected ocular hemorrhages from bleeding complications reported in patients enrolled in the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) -I trial. Additional information was collected on a one-page data form. We compared the incidence and location of ocular hemorrhages in patients with and without diabetes. Results. There were 40, 899 patients (99. 7 %) with information about diabetic history and ocular bleeding. Twelve patients (0. 03 %) had an ocular hemorrhage. Intraocular hemorrhage was confirmed in only one patient. There were 6, 011 patients (15 %) with diabetes, of whom only 1 had an ocular hemorrhage (<b>eyelid</b> <b>hematoma</b> after a documented fall). The upper 95 % confidence intervals for the incidence of intraocular hemorrhage in patients with and without diabetes were 0. 05 % and 0. 006 %, respectively. Conclusions. Ocular hemorrhage and, more important, intraocular hemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is extremely uncommon. The calculated upper 95 % confidence interval for the incidence of intraocular hemorrhage in patients with diabetes was only 0. 05 %. We conclude that diabetic retinopathy should not be considered a contraindication to thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the long-term clinical effect of modified frontalis tendon flap suspension {{in the treatment}} of severe blepharoptosis in children. METHODS: A total of 83 cases(114 eyes) of modified frontalis tendon flap suspension for children severe blepharoptosis correction were analyzed between January 2009 to December 2011 for the efficacy and complications of this surgery. Follow-up observation for 5 a. RESULTS: In the fifth year after operation, there were 84 eyes(73. 7 %) with correction and satisfactory correction, 30 eyes(26. 3 %) were corrected, and the operation was satisfactory. Postoperative complications included 4 eyes(3. 5 %) of inverted eyelashes, of which 3 eyes were given suture traction at 1 / 3 interior of the gray line, 1 wk later inverted eyelashes disappeared, 1 eye of secondary surgery. Conjunctival prolapse was in 2 eyes(1. 8 %), the application of corticosteroids eye drops, pressure bandage were used for 1 wk and conjunctival prolapse disappeared. There was no recurrence of keratitis, eyelid ectropion, septum separation, <b>eyelid</b> angular deformity, <b>hematoma</b> formation, infection and other complications. Postoperative retrograde retrogression and lateral eyelid folds disappear were the most common problems of long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The study shows that this surgical technique is a satisfied method to treat severe blepharoptosis and predictable with few complications...|$|R
40|$|Se realizó un estudio retrospectivo con una {{muestra de}} 71 boxeadores a los cuales se les examinaron las estructuras de referencia mediante oftalmoscopia directa y biomicroscopia ocular, antes de las 6 horas posteriores al término de sus peleas; donde se obtuvo como resultado que los anexos afectados fueron los párpados con 5 hematomas, 4 edemas y 1 excoriación; y la conjuntiva con 4 hiperemias y 8 hemorragias. En el segmento {{anterior}} del ojo sólo se afectó la córnea con 13 lesiones en total, divididas en 10 excoriaciones superficiales y 3 profundas. Las lesiones traumáticas predominantes en los anexos del ojo son las de los párpados y las de la conjuntiva y las del segmento anterior del ojo, las de la córnea. El ojo más afectado fue el izquierdo y las lesiones más frecuentes fueron en las categorías de 13 y 14, 17 y 18 y 19 y 34 años las corneales, las conjuntivales y la de los párpados, respectivamente. A retrospective study {{was carried out}} {{with a sample of}} 71 fighters, whose reference structures were examined by direct ophthalmoscopy and ocular biomicroscopy within the 6 hours following their fights. As a result, it was observed that the affected adnexa were the <b>eyelids</b> with 5 <b>hematomas,</b> 4 edemas and 1 excoriation; and the conjunctiva with 4 hyperemias and 8 hemorrhages. In the anteriro segment, only the cornea was affected with 13 lesions in all, divided into 10 superficial and 3 deep excoriations. The traumatic lesions prevailing in the adnexa of the eye are those of the eyelids and the conjunctiva, whereas the predominating traumatic lesions of the anterior segment of the eye are those of the cornea. The left eye was the most affected and the most frequent lesions were in the categories 13 and 14, 17 and 18 and 19 and 34 years old in the cornea, the conjunctiva and the eyelids, respectively...|$|R
