40|$|<b>Inogatran</b> is a new, synthetic, {{active site}} {{inhibitor}} of thrombin with a molecular weight of 439 dalton. <b>Inogatran</b> (pINN) selectively, rapidly and competitively binds thrombin with a Ki value of 15 nmol/l. In vitro it doubles the plasma thrombin {{time at a}} concentration of 23 nmol/ 1 and the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) at 1. 1 μmol/ 1. Thrombin induced platelet aggregation is inhibited at an IC 50 of 17 nmol/ 1 <b>Inogatran</b> was studied in healthy male human volunteers with regard to tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on haemostasis. It was given intravenously as a bolus in doses from 0. 002 to 1. 1 μmol/kg (n= 2 - 4 at each dose). The highest peak plasma concentration observed was 7 μmol/ 1 corresponding to an APTT prolongation of 3 times. The drug was also given as a constant infusion over 4 h at a dose of 0. 73 μmol/kg per h (n= 16) which resulted in a mean plasma concentration at steady state of 1. 9 μmol/l and an APTT prolongation of 2. 3 times. Finally, it was given as a bolus with radiolabeled compound in a total dose of 25 μmol (n= 16). The drug was well tolerated and without side effects with the exception of slightly increased bleeding tendency at the blood sampling site. <b>Inogatran</b> had a volume of distribution of 0. 26 ml/kg and a total plasma clearance of 6. 1 ml/min per kg, resulting in a half life of about one hour. The drug was not metabolised and it was excreted unchanged with the elimination evenly distributed between urine and faeces. Ex vivo the thrombin time was linearly correlated to the plasma concentration while the APTT-concentration curve was non-linear. At the highest plasma concentrations a slight prolongation of the capillary bleeding time was seen in some subjects. Markers of thrombin activity (thrombin-antithrombin complex and prothrombin fragments 1 – 2) decreased during the constant infusion of the drug. There was no effect on fibrinolysis (PAI-l and t-PA activities) or protein C. It is concluded that <b>inogatran</b> is a safe and effective anticoagulant with favourable pharmacokinetics for i. v. us...|$|E
40|$|The {{drawbacks}} of today's anticoagulants are parenteral use (heparins), {{a narrow}} interval between efficacy and bleeding, {{and the high}} variability of effect with a consequent need for frequent monitoring (coumarins). The aim of the current studies was to evaluate properties important for efficacy and safety of novel anticoagulants, as exemplified by direct thrombin inhibitors, with non-clinical methods. The focus was on the direct thrombin inhibitors <b>inogatran</b> and melagatran. The efficacy, selectivity and safety of the anticoagulants were investigated by using in vivo models of venous and arterial thrombosis, exogenous thrombolysis, endogenous fibrinolysis and bleeding time measurements. The findings were compared with the results obtained in biochemical assays ex vivo and in vitro. Efficacy. Based on similar prolongations of {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) <b>inogatran,</b> argatroban and heparin were equipotent in a venous thrombosis model. A decrease in the enzyme inhibition constant (Ki) obtained in vitro for melagatran compared with <b>inogatran,</b> led to an increased potency for melagatran in the arterial thrombosis model in vivo, while a similar antithrombotic effect was obtained for melagatran and hirudin despite a large difference in the Ki-values. For thrombin inhibitors, a relationship was found between steep dose-response curves and low association rate constants between thrombin and the inhibitor. Warfarin was also found to have a steep dose-response curve. Selectivity. In rats exogenous fibrinolysis, obtained by administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), or endogenous fibrinolysis was either facilitated or inhibited depending on the degree of selectivity against the fibrinolytic system. The results suggest that the ratio of the Ki-values of fibrinolytic enzymes to the required plasma concentration needed in vivo must be used to differentiate thrombin inhibitors rather than the selectivity against thrombin. Safety. <b>Inogatran</b> and melagatran seemed to have a wider separation of antithrombotic effect and bleeding time compared with warfarin. Feiba, a coagulation factor concentrate containing a mixture of coagulation factors, was found to be effective, without being prothrombotic, in reversing the anticoagulant effect of melagatran. Conclusion: For direct thrombin inhibitors to be effective and safe, potent, rapid and selective inhibition of thrombin is needed. Excessive thrombin inhibition can be reversed by prothrombin complex concentrates...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor <b>inogatran</b> was, in the TRIM trial (n= 1209), {{compared with}} unfractionated heparin (UFH) concerning {{the effect on}} cardiovascular end-points in unstable coronary artery disease. The results in TRIM demonstrated a trend towards a benefit for UFH during the treatment phase, which was reduced after drug withdrawal. The first phase of this thesis investigates if the findings in the TRIM trial {{could be explained by}} patterns of molecular markers for coagulation activity, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF 1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, soluble fibrin and fibrin D-dimers, in a subset of patients (n= 320). The relationship between treatment intensity measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and clinical end-points was also investigated. Inhibition of thrombin anticoagulant activity, Le the generation of activated protein C (APC) by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin, could be a possible explanation for results in clinical trials with direct thrombin inhibitors. This concept was evaluated in the second phase of this thesis, which involved studies on the influence of different thrombin inhibitors on the generation of APC and fibrin formation, measured by release of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), in purified systems and on endothelial cells (EC). During treatment with <b>inogatran,</b> PF 1 + 2, TAT complexes and D-dimer decreased to low levels, which lasted the entire infusion period. After cessation of treatment the markers returned to baseline levels. During treatment with heparin PF 1 + 2 and D-dimer rapidly decreased, but later increased above baseline levels. The increase continued after cessation of treatment. High APTT level during <b>inogatran</b> treatment was related to increased risk of cardiovascular events whereas high APTT level during heparin treatment was related to decreased risk of cardiovascular events. The in vitro experiments in this thesis demonstrated that clinically relevant concentrations of <b>inogatran,</b> melagatran, hirudin and AT, in the absence or presence of UFH or LMWH, inhibited thrombinthrombomodulin (TM) -mediated APC generation, in solution or on EC. The irreversible inhibitor PPACK, which lacks therapeutical potential, also inhibited thrombin-TM mediated APC generation on EC, but exaggerated concentrations of the hirudin derivative hirugen neither inhibited APC nor FPA generation. Furthermore the experiments indicated that the tested thrombin inhibitors inhibited FPA generation to the same extent as APC generation. Conclusions Treatment with <b>inogatran</b> or UFH in unstable coronary artery disease decreases markers of coagulation activity, but not in a consistent way. After drug withdrawal a reactivation in biochemical markers of coagulation activity is observed, which may be associated with the increase in cardiovascular events during the same period. Treatment intensity measured by activated partial thromboplastin time is not well defined for low molecular weight direct thrombin inhibitors. All tested thrombin inhibitors inhibited APC generation and fibrin formation approximately to an equal extent. These findings may offer an explanation of the lack of a dose-response effect in clinical trials but do not support the hypothesis that inhibition of APC generation is a likely cause for advantages or disadvantages of direct thrombin inhibitors in comparison to unfractionated heparin in clinical trials on patients with unstable coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|Studies of Myocardial Ischaemia Followed by Reperfusion New Experimental Models {{and their}} Application Yozo Uriuda Despite great {{efforts to reduce}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in ischaemic heart disease, this {{is still the most}} common cause of death in the industrialised countries. To improve the management of such patients, further knowledge is needed of the pathophysiology of ischaemic heart disease. Experimental studies are an important and commonly utilised tool for accomplishing this goal. Three different experimental models are described, two of which were developed for the purpose of these studies. The models were applied to investigate if myocardial injury induced by ischaemia followed by reperfusion could be reduced by the calcium blocker felodipine and by synchronised coronary venous retroperfusion. Furthermore, the effects of a novel selective thrombin inhibitor were studied as regards the prevention of coronary thrombosis and in conjunction with thrombolysis. A new experimental model was developed in which drug was infused retrogradely into the coronary veins of isolated rat hearts subjected to coronary occlusion. This technique resulted in a specific accumulation of the test compound in the ischaemic myocardium. Felodipine was tested in this model and a myocardioprotective effect was documented after 60 min of regional ischaemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. This experimental model is particularly suited for studies of myocar dioprotection with myocardiodepressive drugs and of those with vasodilatatory effects. In canine hearts subjected to 90 min of regional ischaemia followed by six hours of reperfusion, short-term treatment with synchronised coronary venous retroperfusion before full reperfusion reduced the final extent of myocardial damage. The mechanism behind this beneficial effect was probably a gradual induction of reperfusion. To mimic the clinical situation during thrombolysis in patients with threatening myocardial infarction, a model of coronary thrombosis followed by thrombolysis was established in closed-chest pigs. Induction of a coronary thrombotic occlusion via the insertion of a copper coil and subsequent thrombolysis achieved by tissue plasmin activator caused reproducible myocardial areas at risk and infarct sizes. This model is intended for investigations of pharmacological interventions interfering with the thrombotic and thrombolytic process. <b>Inogatran,</b> a new selective inhibitor of thrombin, was more effective in preventing the formation of a coronary thrombus than heparin and acetylsalicylic acid. The most likely explanation for this is inhibition of clot-bound thrombin and platelet activation induced by thrombin. Thrombotic occlusions formed in the presence of <b>inogatran</b> seemed more susceptible to spontaneous endogenous fibrinolysis than those formed in the absence of this compound. An enhanced local release of endothelin-like immuno-reactivity and a more marked vasoconstrictor response were demonstrated in the ischaemic/reperfused coronary artery in the coronary thrombosis/ thrombolysis model. This effect, which was related to the activation of endothelin-A receptors, may contribute to the development of myocardial injury following ischaemia and reperfusion, for instance, by enhancing the no-reflow phenomenon.

40|$|In {{patients}} with unstable coronary artery disease, this study evaluated {{the degree of}} inflammation and coagulation activity, relations to myocardial cell damage, prognosis, and influences of randomisation to 72 h infusion with three different doses of <b>inogatran,</b> a direct thrombin inhibitor (n= 904), or unfractionated heparin (n= 305). Anticoagulant treatment effects were evaluated with aPT time. In <b>inogatran</b> treated {{patients with}} aPT times ≥ 44 s (median), the 7 -days event rate - death, myocardial infarction or refractory angina – was 11. 6 %, compared to 6. 6 % with aPT times < 44 s (p= 0. 01). Higher aPT times was related to improved outcome during heparin treatment. Markers of inflammation, i. e. fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP), and coagulation, i. e. prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), soluble fibrin (SF) and D-dimer were analysed in serial samples (n= 320). High fibrinogen, F 1 + 2 and D-dimer levels persisted at 30 days. Patients with myocardial damage, detected by elevated troponin, had higher levels of all markers except TAT. Ischemic events occurred at 30 days in 17 % of patients with high (pre-treatment top tertile) and 8. 5 % of patients with lower fibrinogen levels (p= 0. 03), while high CRP levels only were related to increased mortality. At 30 days, patients with high compared to low pre-treatment levels of TAT or SF had 40 % lower event rate. Patients with early decreased compared to raised F 1 + 2 or TAT levels during treatment had 50 % lower 30 -days event rate (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The aPT time is an inappropriate indicator of antithrombotic efficacy. The raise in fibrinogen in the acute phase is sustained, and indicates risk of thrombosis and new ischemic events. The pronounced CRP elevation is transient, but associated with increased mortality. Higher coagulation activity may identify patients with a thrombotic condition as the major cause of instability, who are best responders to anticoagulant therapy. However, reactivation of coagulation activity with raised risk of ischemic events is a concern at cessation of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Aim Unstable {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disease involving both thrombotic and inflammatory processes. We have assessed the time-course {{and the influence of}} thrombin inhibitors on changes in fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels, and their relation to myocardial ischaemia in unstable CAD. Methods and results Three hundred and twenty patients were randomized to 72 h infusion with three different doses of <b>inogatran,</b> a direct thrombin inhibitor, or unfractionated heparin. There {{were no significant differences between}} the treatment groups in fibrinogen or C-reactive protein levels. Overall, the fibrinogen levels were significantly increased in the first 24 – 96 h and still elevated at 30 days. The C-reactive protein levels showed a more pronounced increase during the first 24 – 96 h, but then markedly decreased over 30 days. Troponin-positive compared to troponin-negative patients had higher fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels up to 96 h, although there was an increase compared to pre-treatment levels in both groups. A high fibrinogen level (pre-treatment top tertile) was associated with an increased rate of death or myocardial (re-) infarction at 30 days, 13 % vs 5. 6 %, P = 0. 03, and increased long-ter...|$|E
40|$|For {{prevention}} and treatment of thrombotic diseases with an anticoagulant drug {{it is important that}} an adequate dose is given to avoid occurrence or recurrence of thrombosis, without increasing the risk of bleeding and other adverse events to unacceptable levels. The aim of this thesis was to develop mathematical models that describe the dose-concentration (pharmacokinetic) and concentration-response (pharmacodynamic) relationships of direct thrombin inhibitors, in order to estimate optimal dosages for treatment and long-term secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were developed, based on data from clinical investigations in healthy volunteers and patients receiving intravenous <b>inogatran,</b> subcutaneous melagatran and/or its oral prodrug ximelagatran. The benefit-risk profiles of different ximelagatran dosages were estimated using clinical utility functions. These functions were based on the probabilities and fatal consequences of thrombosis, bleeding and elevation of the hepatic enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). The studies demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of melagatran and ximelagatran were predictable and well correlated to renal function. The coagulation marker, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), increased non-linearly with increasing thrombin inhibitor plasma concentration. Overall, the systemic melagatran exposure (AUC) and APTT were similarly predictive of thrombosis and bleedings. The identified relationship between the risk of ALAT-elevation and melagatran AUC suggests that the incidence approaches a maximum at high exposures. The estimated clinical utility was favourable compared to placebo in the overall study population and in special subgroups of patients following fixed dosing of ximelagatran for long-term secondary prevention of VTE. Individualized dosing was predicted to add limited clinical benefit in this indication. The models developed can be used to support the studied dosage and for selection of alternative dosing strategies that may improve the clinical outcome of ximelagatran treatment. In addition, the models may be extrapolated to aid the dose selection in clinical trials with other direct thrombin inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is the {{underlying}} cause of about 50 % of all deaths in the western world. Peripheral vascular disease commonly affects the arteries supplying the leg and is mostly caused by atherosclerosis. When medical treatment of lower extremity ischemia has failed, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and bypass surgery are two major therapeutic options. The advances in vascular surgery and endovascular techniques over the past half-century have greatly expanded the number of arterial lesions that can be treated. The major limitations of a successful revascularisation are thrombosis and the later development of restenosis. This thesis has explored the mechanisms of thrombosis and restenosis after vascular injury, focusing on the interaction between coagulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The long-term outcome of infrainguinal PTA was evaluated in 77 patients. Cumulative primary and secondary patency rates, respectively, were 81 % and 86 % at 1 year, 65 % and 73 % at 5 years, and 12 % and 17 % at 10 years. Patency rates were better for patients with claudication than critical ischemia. Stenoses had better primary patency than occlusions. Generalised femoral artery disease and diabetes mellitus predicted poor survival. Although the overall long-term patency of infrainguinal PTA is poor, the technique has a low morbidity and can be performed in selected patients with a reasonable long-term result. If conservative treatment has failed infrainguinal PTA should be considered, when lesions and patients are suitable, because of its minimal invasive nature. It is also important when treating patients with peripheral arterial disease to give attention to their general cardiovascular condition. In an experimental study a specific direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>inogatran,</b> reduced neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury in rats. A more prolonged administration of the thrombin inhibitor gave a further reduction of the neointimal hyperplasia. It seems that inhibition of thrombin activity is not only important early after injury, but also later. This could have clinical implications {{in the treatment of}} restenosis. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the vessel wall may play important roles in the development of restenosis after angioplasty. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, a much more prolonged inflammatory response than previously noted was observed after angioplasty, but only minor changes in coagulation activity. C-reactive protein was elevated the day after angioplasty and peaked after one week. Coagulation and inflammatory markers were not significantly related to restenosis. The redox-active protein, thioredoxin, was significantly elevated 4 hours after angioplasty and returned to baseline within 24 hours. Circulating thioredoxin could theoretically impair the chemotactic response at local sites of inflammation. An association in patients with elevated levels of thioredoxin after angioplasty and reduced restenosis needs to be further evaluated. This thesis has discussed the intimate relation between thrombosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and restenosis. Further studies are needed to delineate the molecular mechanisms behind these observations and their involvement in thrombosis and restenosis. It is not only important to be able to understand the individual pathways of these processes, but also the ways they intersect and interact. If these pathways are further defined, improved treatment strategies, including antithrombotic treatments, statins, and thioredoxin, to modulate postprocedure inflammation could be tailored...|$|E
