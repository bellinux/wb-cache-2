40|$|An {{alignment}} positioning {{mechanism for}} correcting and compensating for misalignment of structures to be coupled is disclosed. The mechanism comprises a power screw with {{a base portion}} and a threaded shank portion. A mounting fixture is provided for rigidly coupling said base portion to the mounting interface of a supporting structure with the axis of the screw perpendicular thereto. A traveling ball nut threaded on the power screw is formed with an <b>external</b> <b>annular</b> arcuate surface configured {{in the form of}} a spherical segment and enclosed by a ball nut housing with a conforming arcuate surface for permitting gimballed motion thereon. The ball nut housing is provided with a mounting surface which is positionable in cooperable engagement with the mounting interface of a primary structure to be coupled to the supporting structure. Cooperative means are provided on the ball nut and ball nut housing, respectively, for positioning the ball nut and ball nut housing in relative gimballed position within a predetermined range of relative angular relationship whereby severe structural stresses due to unequal loadings and undesirable bending moments on the mechanism are avoided...|$|E
40|$|A semi-numerical {{method is}} {{reviewed}} for solving {{a set of}} coupled partial differential equations subject to mixed and possibly coupled boundary conditions. The line method of analysis {{is applied to the}} Navier-Cauchy equations of elastic and elastoplastic equilibrium to calculate the displacement distributions in various, simple geometry bodies containing cracks. The application of this method to the appropriate field equations leads to coupled sets of simultaneous ordinary differential equations whose solutions are obtained along sets of lines in a discretized region. When decoupling of the equations and their boundary conditions is not possible, the use of a successive approximation procedure permits the analytical solution of the resulting ordinary differential equations. The use of this method is illustrated by reviewing and presenting selected solutions of mixed boundary value problems in three dimensional fracture mechanics. These solutions are of great importance in fracture toughness testing, where accurate stress and displacement distributions are required for the calculation of certain fracture parameters. Computations obtained for typical flawed specimens include that for elastic as well as elastoplastic response. Problems in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems are included. Results are summarized for a finite geometry rectangular bar with a central through-the-thickness or rectangular surface crack under remote uniaxial tension. In addition, stress and displacement distributions are reviewed for finite circular bars with embedded penny-shaped cracks, and rods with <b>external</b> <b>annular</b> or ring cracks under opening mode tension. The results obtained show that the method of lines presents a systematic approach to the solution of some three-dimensional mechanics problems with arbitrary boundary conditions. The advantage of this method over other numerical solutions is that good results are obtained even from the use of a relatively coarse grid...|$|E
40|$|The Coanda {{effect on}} the lower surface of the Anuloid model (scale 1 : 22) has been {{investigated}} by means of CFD analysis and experiments on a simplified configuration. The motivations of this investigation are essentially related to the crucial aspect concerning the original maneuvering solution of the aircraft based on {{the realization of the}} Coanda effect properly generated on a specific sector of the <b>external</b> <b>annular</b> body on the lower surface. This work was not planned in the submitted proposal and was activated on the light of the suggestions pointed out from the project evaluators focused just on a possible critical behavior of the Coanda effect. On the respect of these suggestions the priority was given in this direction cancelling the work related to the WP 3 " Power means, flight control means and remote (or tethered) control system" and related deliverable. From this point of view a CFD analysis has been performed by FESA evaluating the effects of the modification of the geometry of the circumferential vanes on the flow evolution around the lower surface of the aircraft. Moreover also the ground effect has been analyzed considering several distances between the model and the ground. The main result of this analysis reports that Coanda effect in the original design is metastable. The new geometry shows instead that a very stable Coanda effect. The experimental investigation performed by POLITO was focused on the measurements of the pressure distributions around the lower curved surface {{in the case of the}} original geometry. Also some modifications of the base of the central body aimed at promoting the Coanda effect were considered mounting different disks on the base that changed the geometry of the annular exit section of the wall jet. A comparison between the experimental data and a model present in the literature representing the Coanda effect in terms of angle of separation as a function of a geometric parameter was also made. Simple flow visualizations were performed using tufts. Furthermore also the effects of asymmetric disks mounting were tested in order to verify the asymmetry of the Coanda effect devoted to the generation of appropriate load aerodynamic distribution on the lower surface aimed at the maneuverability of the aircraft. Finally the effects of the Reynolds number were evaluated. From this analysis is evidenced that the original geometry does not show any evidence of Coanda effect for all the Reynolds number tested. Introducing the base modifications the flow is more attached to the rounded lower base highlighting the promotion of the Coanda effect that in any case does not involve the whole rounded lower wall of the mode...|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of the use of}} semiconductor photocatalysis for water purification is given. The basic principles of semiconductor photocatalysis are described along with the current understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism(s) and how it fits in with the major features of the observed Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type kinetics of pollutant destruction. These features are illustrated based on literature on the destruction of aqueous solutions of 4 -chlorophenol as a pollutant, using titanium dioxide as the photocatalyst. The range of organic and inorganic pollutants that can be destroyed by semiconductor photocatalysis are reported and discussed. The basic considerations that need to be made when designing a reactor for semiconductor photocatalysis are considered. These include: the nature of the reactor glass, the type of illumination source, and the nature and type of semiconductor photocatalyst. The key basic photoreactor designs are reported and discussed, including <b>external</b> illumination, <b>annular,</b> and circular photoreactors. Actual designs that have been used for fixed and thin falling film semiconductor photocatalyst reactors are illustrated and their different features discussed. Basic non-concentrating and concentrating solar photoreactors for semiconductor photocatalysis are also reported. The design features of the major commercial photocatalytic reactor systems for water purification are reported and illustrated. Several case studies involving commercial photocatalytic reactors for water purification are reported. An attempt is made briefly to compare the efficacy of semiconductor photocatalysis for water purification with that of other, more popular and prevalent water purification processes. The future of semiconductor photocatalysis as a method of purifying water is considered...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a numerical simulation of the combustion of natural gas (methane) and atmospheric air in an axissymmetrical cylindrical chamber. The simulations are performed assuming staged non pre-mixture combustion process in two global steps, where the fuel is injected through a central circular duct, and air is injected through an <b>annular</b> <b>external</b> duct, both in the same plane. The mass, momentum, energy and chemical species conservation equations are solved. Thermal radiation in the interior of the chamber is modeled by the zonal method, in which the wavelength dependence of the gas properties is resolved by the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases-Model (WSGGM). Turbulent flow is described by the model. For the chemical reactions the Eddy Breakup-Arrhenius model is employed. The resulting differential governing equations are solved by the Control Volume approach. The results include all the flow regions, the chemical species distributions, the velocity fields and the net heat transfer by radiation...|$|R
40|$|Aural cholesteatoma is {{characterized}} by invading squamous epithelia with altered growth properties. Cytokeratin (CK) expression is affected in epidermal proliferative diseases and represents the alterations of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In the present study, the intensity of CK immuno-expression was determined, using densitometry at various sites in experimental cholesteatoma in order to characterize changes of keratinocytes. With cholesteatoma formation, CK 4, a marker for non-keratinizing epithelia, increased in the suprabasal layers of the <b>annular</b> <b>external</b> auditory canal (EAC) and at the pars tensa indicating an altered differentiation and migration of keratinocytes. CK 5 / 6, a marker of keratinizing squamous epithelium, increased only at the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane, indicating basal keratinocyte hyperplasia. CK 1 / 10 increased in the suprabasal layer at the annular EAC, and at the peripheral pars tensa, indicating increased terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. CK 13 / 16, markers of differentiation and hyperproliferation, increased in suprabasal layer of the EAC, and at the peripheral pars tensa. However, it decreased in the basal layer of the EAC, indicating hyperproliferatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{interphase}} {{nucleus of the}} cells of several tissues of Lacandonia schismatica was studied using electron microscopy cytochemical and immunocytochemical methods. The EDTA staining procedure, preferential for RNP, contrasted the Lacandonia granules and perichromatin fibrils. These granules {{were found to be}} relatively resistant to RNAse hydrolysis, but they were easily digested if RNAse treatment was carried out after a short hydrolysis with pronase. Bismuth oxynitrate stained granular structures about 17 nm in diameter and the periphery of a few Lacandonia granules. The anti-snURNPs bound to RNP-containing fibrils in the perichromatin and interchromatin space and also to the periphery of some Lacandonia granules. Immunolabeling of DNA demonstrated numerous filaments of extended chromatin in the perichromatin and interchromatin spaces which were closely related to, Lacandonia granules. These observations suggested that Lacandonia granules are equivalent to Balbiani ring granules of nuclei with polytene chromosomes and to perichromatin granules of other plant and animal nuclei. The small number of Lacandonia granules labeled in their periphery by anti-snURNP mAb were interpreted as being immature granules in the process of formation. The <b>external</b> or <b>annular</b> part of the ring-shaped structures is heavily labeled by anti-URNP mAbs but scarcely stained by the EDTA procedure. These features indicate that this region contains abundant proteins associated with snURNAs but probably little snURNAs. The synaptonemal-like complexes previously found in the interphase nuclei of Lacandonia are formed by two parallel masses of compact chromatin, which react with anti-DNA, and a central clear space crossed by fiber. Most of these fibers do not react with tests for DNA or RNA and are probably composed of proteins. The EDTA procedure contrasts some fibrils at the internal aspect of the masses of compact chromatin, suggesting the presence of remnants of the lateral element of a synaptonemal complex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} and optimization of a photochemical reactor {{for the production of}} hydroxyl radicals. These radicals can be used in advanced oxidation processes for water purification. The UV-lamps used in the photochemical reactor lead to a relatively high energy and operating cost. Minimization of these costs is possible via a model-based optimization of the reactor geometry. First, a model is built taking into account the reaction kinetics, the reactor geometry and the radiation intensity distribution in the reactor. Afterwards, two different configurations of photochemical reactors are optimized. The first modeled reactor configuration is a single-lamp reactor and consists of a cylindrical UV-lamp that is present inside a quartz sleeve, outside of which the water flows between it and the <b>external</b> reactor wall (<b>annular</b> channel reactor). A rigorous optimization problem is formulated consisting of the calculation of the optimal reactor geometry (length and radius) in such a way that, for a given reactor volume and a given flow rate of the water to be treated, the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. By solving this optimization problem, {{it has been shown that}} an optimal reactor length exists. If the absorption coefficient of the water or the reaction rate constant increases, the optimal reactor length increases as well. The second modeled reactor configuration is similar to the first one but now contains multiple lamps positioned symmetrically in a circular pattern (i. e. multi-lamp reactor). The optimization problem consists of the calculation of the optimal lamp position inside the reactor in such a way that the mean outlet concentration of an organic pollutant is minimized. The lamp position is given by the radial distance between the centers of the reactor and a lamp. Again a well-posed optimization problem is obtained and an optimal lamp position exists. If the number of lamps or the reaction rate constant increases or the absorption coefficient of the water decreases, the optimal distance between the centers of the reactor and the lamp increases. status: publishe...|$|R
