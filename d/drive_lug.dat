50|$|The Nikon S4 was a {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced by}} Nikon {{that was very}} similar to the Nikon S3 but had a slightly lower price. This was because it used a cloth shutter curtain (rather than titanium foil curtains) and it lacked the self-timer and motor <b>drive</b> <b>lug</b> of the S3. The viewfinder frame-line for 35mm lenses was also omitted. In all other respects, the cameras were identical.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding clutch gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the declutch mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The declutch mechanism required adjustment to allow full <b>drive</b> <b>lug</b> engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a boroscope used so that the action of the clutch could be seen. Boroscope examination of several declutching and re-clutching tests showed that the clutch lugs would not engage fully. The majo...|$|E
