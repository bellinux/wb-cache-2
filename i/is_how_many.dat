25|$|A graph {{property}} {{is the question}} of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Josef Škvorecký {{also notes}} that all the major cast members as well as Harlan himself tried in various ways to avoid {{participation}} in the project; however Škvorecký ascribes a rather different motivation to the cast {{than the one that}} Azuelos propounds. Škvorecký attributes the reluctance of actors to participate in what he characterizes as a [...] "politically-most-correct film" [...] as an indication of [...] "how aware most German artists were of the fact that antisemitism under Hitler changed from prejudice to murder." [...] While cast members could have declined the roles that were offered to them, Škvorecký asserts that such action would have required [...] "extraordinary courage: the dire consequences of such an act of defiance were only too easy to imagine." [...] According to Škvorecký, [...] "Goebbels either outwitted , or knew about compromising circumstances in their lives and used this knowledge for bludgeoning them into acceptance." [...] Elaborating on the [...] "compromising circumstances", Škvorecký writes, [...] "One of the paradoxes of this sinister film <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> participants in the violently racist project had either Jewish spouses or relatives, were disciples of Jewish artists and known friends or Jews, or had been—before the Nazi takeover—left-leaning intellectuals, even communists." [...] For example, Škvorecký points out that Veit Harlan's first wife was Dora Gerson, a German-Jewish actress and cabaret singer. Harlan himself had flirted with socialism. Although Werner Krauss was openly antisemitic and an ardent Nazi, his daughter-in-law was Jewish. Ferdinand Marian had a half-Jewish daughter from his first marriage and the former husband of his second wife was a Jew.|$|E

He can also attack enemies {{while in the}} air or while standing by simply holding the sword in position.

Players collect gems in order to [...] "bribe" [...] the creature who guards the entrance to the next level; if players do not have enough gems, they cannot progress to the next level. At the end of each level is a boss creature which has been empowered by Malkil's black magic.

Kuros has a life meter which decreases as time passes and when he sustains damage from enemies. Players loses a life when Kuros' life meter runs out, but upon restarting they keep all the items they have obtained up to that point. The game ends when all three lives have been lost, but players have the choice to continue and restart at the level in which they lost their last life; upon continuing, players keep all their items obtained up to that point, but their score goes back to zero. Along the way, players can replenish Kuros' life meter by collecting pieces of meat scattered throughout the levels.|$|E
