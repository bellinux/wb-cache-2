5000|$|As {{early as}} 1977, CGSI {{established}} formal product testing to evaluate quality by drawing samples {{directly from the}} market without involving the manufacturers in the testing process. Test results were a revelation for quality control regulatory authorities.

CGSI sent the results {{to the government and}} Indian Standards Institution (ISI) now Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), with a demand for mandatory certification. In 1986, with the passing of the Pressure Stoves Quality Control Order, ISI Certification for pressure stoves became mandatory. Subsequently CGSI did tests on electrical appliances and fittings - irons, immersion heaters, culminating in the enactment of the <b>Household</b> <b>Electrical</b> <b>Appliances</b> (Quality Control) Order. CGSI has developed a food adulteration testing kit and a milk adulteration testing kit for use by the lay consumers.

40|$|The {{household}} appliances in buildings have increased {{rapidly in the}} recent years. However, the surge withstanding capability of these {{household appliances}} has not been increased. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} install surge protection device (SPD) to prevent serious damage of <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> caused by the in-rushing surges. In order to avoid the oscillation phenomenon, the effective protection distance of SPDs should be addressed before installing SPDs in the buildings. This paper discussed the influence of a group of common <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> connected in parallel on the effective protection distance of an SPD to a household appliance. The surges impinging on the household appliances connected to a distribution system are analyzed using electromagnetic transient analysis software. It is found that the SPD's protection distance increases when multiple household appliances are connected in parallel. The SPD's effective protection distance for one specific household appliance, which is determined from the case in which only this household appliance is used, is a conservative value; even if other household appliances are connected with this appliance, the SPD still provides an effective protection to this specific appliance.

40|$|Sufficient {{data about}} {{electricity}} consumption over large {{periods of time}} was accumulated and analysed {{in order to develop}} appropriate electricity-saving measures. An important first step was to analyse and identify <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> that had energy saving potential. Different behavioural consumption profiles were analysed using information from two sources: 1) technical data about electricity consumption (electricity bill) and 2) data about <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliance</b> usage and consumer awareness obtained from a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire consisted of four sections of questions which concerned residents’ backgrounds, residential information, consumers’ awareness about energy efficiency (EE) and the energy usage of each house. The results showed that the electricity consumption profile of an individual household could be most related to the EE approach. It indicated that consumers’ behaviour (awareness and practice) resulted in one of the important factors related to high electricity consumption. Another important conclusion of our questionnaire-based analysis was that the implementation of the EE approach could help the consumer to reduce their monthly energy consumption...|$|R

To minimize common method variance, we employed a time-lagged design in gathering our data wherein we administered surveys at three time points. The questionnaires were coded to match the surveys of supervisors and employees. In the first survey (Time 1), team members were asked to evaluate authentic leadership of their team supervisor and their own perception of psychological empowerment. Demographic data were also collected in this survey. About a month later (Time 2), team members filled out the second survey on core self-evaluations and political skill. At Time 3, which took place 1 month after Time 2, team supervisors assessed their subordinates’ proactive behavior.|$|R

30|$|We {{include several}} control {{variables}} {{in this study}} to address possible alternative explanations of authentic leadership and proactive behavior. Firstly, we collected data from two companies, so we use a categorical variable (1 [*]=[*]the <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliance</b> enterprise in Beijing; 2 [*]=[*]the petrochemical equipment company in Luoyang) to tap the difference between two companies (e.g. firm size etc.). As well, we use a dummy variable to identify whether employees in these teams are also leaders in another team (called as Leader-member), {{as a result of}} the nested organization. We also control for employee demographics, including gender (0 [*]=[*]male; 1 [*]=[*]female), age (in years), working time with supervisors (in months), and working time in the organization (in months). Finally, the interaction frequency is controlled because it shows whether followers have a “closer” relationship with their leader (Antonakis and Atwater 2002), which may impact the relationship between authentic leadership and employees’ proactive behavior.|$|R
