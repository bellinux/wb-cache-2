50|$|The general {{freezing}} {{process for}} mammalian cells involves suspending a small {{density of the}} cells of interest in a solution of cryopreservation agents in a cryovial and freezing the cells to a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius. A slow <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> is important to maintaining {{the health of the}} cell culture. Freezing the cells at a rate of -1 to -3 degrees Celsius per minute is generally acceptable in maintaining cell culture health. Freezing too quickly risks damaging the cells. At a <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> of -5 degrees Celsius per minute, significant decreases of the thawed cell culture is observed. Even more pronounced decreases in cell culture health is observed at faster freezing rates, {{to the point that the}} cell culture cannot maintain a cell density. The use of cryopreservation agents is also key to the freezing process. A common cryoprotection agent used is 10% solution of DMSO, which acts to protect the cells from the rupturing caused by ice crystals during freezing and during thawing. DMSO has been observed agent to be toxic to cells, and requires dilution after the cells are thawed.|$|E
50|$|The {{process begins}} when surface water nucleates around {{irregularities}} where it meets the container wall and freezes inward. If the c-axis {{of the first}} crystal to form is not vertical, the basal plane intersects the surface along a line perpendicular to the c-axis and ice needles tend to propagate across the surface along this line. At {{the same time a}} curtain of ice grows down into the supercooled water along the basal plane. As the film of ice grows to cover most of the surface the crystals merge and become fixed rigidly in place and the sheet of ice continues freezing towards the middle until only a small hole remains unfrozen. The crystallite curtains tend to join at an angle of 60 degrees and so the hole is often triangular, although other geometric shapes are possible. The continuing expansion of the ice downwards into the water then squeezes the remaining water up through the hole and a convex meniscus is formed which bulges slightly higher than the surface of the ice. As the edges of the meniscus freeze they create a small dam which causes the water to rise higher and as it expands above the ice dam the edges freeze again to form another dam on top of the first one. If the rate of expansion of the water {{is the same as the}} rate of freezing at the lip of the hole then this process is continually repeated and successive layers form a tube of ice. The growth of the tube continues in this way until the tip seals over or until all the water is frozen. The formation of ice spikes is related to the shape of the water body, the concentration of dissolved impurities, air temperature and air circulation above the water. Spikes that grow from a crystallite formed below the surface of the water may project from the ice sheet at a steep angle, rather than perpendicular to it.Small ice spikes can be formed artificially on ice cubes produced in domestic refrigerators using distilled water in plastic ice cube trays. The formation of the spike is similar to that of the naturally occurring spike in that the expansion of interior water and the reduction of volume in the interior of the cube increase the pressure on the water pushing it upward through the hole. The growth of the tube ceases when the drop at the top of the tube freezes entirely, which is substantially before the rest of the water in the cube is frozen. This method produces small spikes which are usually round or triangular in cross section with sharp tips. Experiments using this method have been carried out in laboratory settings but it has been found that spikes are less likely to form in ice cubes made from non-distilled water as impurities in the water inhibit spike formation. This poses the question of how naturally occurring ice spikes form in tapwater or rainwater and Libbrecht and Lui have suggested that, in the case of the small spikes grown in a refrigerator, impurities will become increasingly concentrated in the small unfrozen droplet at the top of the tube reducing the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> and so the growth of the tube. However, they believe that on the rare occasions when exceptionally large spikes grow in natural, outdoor ice formations, some other mechanism must remove the impurities that build up at the top of the growing tube. Either impurities may be forced into pockets that freeze more slowly, or perhaps a convective flow, which would be insignificant in the smaller, artificially grown spikes, replaces the water at the top of the tube with fresh water from below.|$|E

A two layer ocean mixed layer model {{is used to}} study the relationship between onset of freezing and mixed layer depth, wind forcing, surface buoyancy flux, and temperature and salinity changes between the two layers. Universal non- dimensional parameters for stability and surface forcing are derived and related to the maximum <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Analytic solutions to the model are found {{in terms of the}} universal parameters and the model turbulent mixing tuning constants. Sensitivity studies show the dependence of the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> on the stability as defined by the salinity and temperature jumps, the forcing by wind stress and surface heat flux, and the mixed layer depth. Results show that an increase in heat flux produces a nearly linear increase in the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Mixing energy from the wind, proportional to the wind speed cubed, results in a nearly linear decrease in <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> There is a nonlinear relationship between the temperature jump between layers and the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Warming of the deeper layer decreases the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> and ultimately prevents freezing.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to present a {{procedural}} analysis of the cryoablations performed in our department for small renal tumors and to try to identify clinical parameters or factors that influence the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> during the procedure. Patients and Methods: We collected all data from the procedures performed in our department until August 2007. Based on the intraoperative biopsy result, we grouped the cases in two groups: renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign. We calculated the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> in both groups and compared them. Finally, we performed a univariate and multivariate analysis to identify clinical parameters that significantly influence the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: A total of 70 cryoablations of small renal tumors in 67 patients were performed during this period. From these, 56 procedures met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed further. The RCC group consisted of 48 cases (39 RCC and 9 lesions with a nondiagnostic biopsy) while 8 formed the benign group. There was no difference in the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> between these two groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{two-dimensional}} phase-field {{method was}} developed that {{allowed us to}} observe {{the evolution of the}} composition field and the microstructure of lamellar eutectics caused by variations in the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Solid-phase nucleation, lamella termination, and migration of the three-phase junction were studied to elucidate the role of each in microstructure changes. This evolution is often complex due to the interplay between interface kinetics, the composition field, and the widths of the solid lamellae. When the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> is increased, the supersaturation in front of the lamellae increases, causing formation of deep depressions, followed by nucleation of the other solid phase, instability, and movement of the three-phase junction. If the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> is subsequently held constant, the microstructure eventually becomes stable. With a decrease in <b>freezing</b> <b>rate,</b> instability develops that changes the local growth direction and provokes changes in lamellar width followed by elimination of some lamellae. With <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> oscillations, backmelting becomes important, especially for large lamellar spacing, large amplitudes, and low frequencies.

The overall objective {{of this research was}} to develop a cryopreservation procedure to improve the post-thaw survival rate of bison sperm. For this purpose two different studies were conducted. The first study consisted of two experiments. In Experiment 1, damage to bison sperm motility characteristics at different stages of cryopreservation was quantified. In Experiment 2, the effects of extenders and <b>freeze</b> <b>rates</b> on post-thaw motility and structural characteristics were investigated. In Experiment 1, semen was diluted in Triladyl extender and frozen with a <b>freeze</b> <b>rate</b> – 10 °C/min. Sperm motility characteristics, i. e., total motility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP) and straight-line velocity (VSL) were recorded in fresh, diluted, chilled (4 °C) and frozen-thawed semen using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). There was a significant decline (P 0. 05) on immediate (0 h) post-thaw total and progressive sperm motilities. However, sperm velocities (VCL, VAP, VSL) were better (P 0. 05). In Experiment 3 fresh bison sperm (100 x 106 /ml in Tris-citric acid [TCA] buffer) were pre-treated with different concentrations of CLC (0, 1, 2 or 3 mg) and then diluted in TCA extender for cryopreservation. The CLC-treated sperm showed better (P < 0. 05) post-thaw (0 h) total and progressive motilities, IPM and IPM-IACR, and also less (P < 0. 05) percent of decline in these characteristics after 3 h of post-thaw incubation at 37 °C compared to control (0 mg CLC) samples. The overall results of the study showed that freeze-thaw is the most damaging stage to bison sperm. Post-thaw bison sperm quality at 0 h was better in Triladyl than TCA and zwitterion extenders; however, after 3 h sperm survival was better (P < 0. 05) in TCA extender and in semen frozen at a <b>freeze</b> <b>rate</b> of – 40 °C/min.

An experimental test is carried out of the theoretical predictions for a sudden change of translation rate. The MnBi-Bi eutectic is solidified with current-induced interface demarcation. The experimental results accord reasonably well with theory if the silica ampoule wall is assumed to either (1) contribute only a resistance to heat exchange between the sample and the furnace wall or (2) transmit heat effectively in the axial direction by radiation. In an attempt to explain the fact that a finer microstructure is obtained in space, MnBi-Bi microstructure is determined when the <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> is increased or decreased rapidly. Preliminary results suggest that fiber branching does not occur as readily as fiber termination...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{lyophilization}} {{process was}} developed for manufacturing the dried product of Lactobacillus acidophilus with high cell viability. Three major factors, <b>freezing</b> <b>rate,</b> specific surface area of samples, and stabilizer type and their synergy were shown to {{play a crucial role}} in the development of an effective lyophilization process. Finally we found an optimal combination among three process parameters mentioned above: an exceptionally high cell survival percentage of 90 % was achieved using the 8. 28 cm- 1 specific surface area of samples, slow <b>freezing</b> <b>rate,</b> and a stabilizer composition of 4 % skim milk + 1 % glycerol + 0. 1 % calcium chloride. ope...|$|E

A narrow range (5 - 20 °C min- 1) of <b>freezing</b> <b>rate</b> was required to avoid damage to the microstructure of the agar foams. The size of cells in the foam decreased with increasing <b>freezing</b> <b>rate.</b> Agar foams of more than 4 wt% agar content absorbed more energy than a polystyrene foam in compression tests. Foams with a higher agar content absorbed more energy. The behaviour of agar foams in compression tests {{could be explained by}} the modified beam theory for cellular foams. Agar foams were thermally stable up to 200 °C, and were also stable in a humid environment. close 192...|$|E

Here we show that southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), equipped with oceanographic sensors, can measure winter hydrography with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. Seals provided a 30 -fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea ice zone, allowing the major fronts to be mapped south of 60 °S. Sea-ice formation rates in the East Antarctic sector were estimated from salinity increase in the upper water column and compared to simulations with a circumpolar finite-element sea-ice ocean model. From the observations, peak <b>freezing</b> <b>rates</b> of 2. 5 - 3 cm/d were estimated for the period from late April to early May during the rapid northward expansion of the ice cover. While the pack ice becomes more compact, sea ice formation declines to 1 cm/d in June/July, and virtually stops {{by the end of}} August, when the maximum ice extent is reached. Modeled and observed <b>freezing</b> <b>rates</b> agree remarkably well, so that the model can be used to complete the seasonal cycle. By sampling the ocean during winter, elephant seals fill a blind spot in our sampling coverage, bringing us closer to a truly global ocean observing system...|$|R

50|$|Cryoimmunotherapy, also {{referred}} to as cryoimmunology, is an oncological treatment for various cancers that combines cryoablation of tumor with immunotherapy treatment. In-vivo cryoablation of a tumor, alone, can induce an immunostimulatory, systemic anti-tumor response, resulting in a cancer vaccine - the abscopal effect. Thus, cryoablation of tumors is a way of achieving autologous, in-vivo tumor lysate vaccine and treat metastatic disease. However, cryoablation alone may produce an insufficient immune response, depending on various factors, such as high <b>freeze</b> <b>rate.</b> Combining cryotherapy with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for cancer treatment.|$|R
