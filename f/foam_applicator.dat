50|$|The Tipp-Ex {{correction}} fluid {{is a white}} liquid. It is used for painting over mistakes {{in a piece of}} writing. A brush (which was later replaced by a <b>foam</b> <b>applicator)</b> is attached to the cap, so when the bottle is closed, the brush is immersed in the Tipp-Ex. When unscrewed, the brush is covered in liquid Tipp-Ex which is then painted over the mistake.

40|$|Synopsis [...] A PRESSED POWDER is {{essentially}} a dry powder compressed in cake form {{to be applied to}} the body, face, or eyes with a puff, brush, or <b>foam</b> <b>applicator.</b> The parameters of RAW MATERIAL SELECTION and their uses in pressed powders are studied, and prop-erties imparted to the face and eyes are briefly indicated. Representative FORMULATIONS, and MANUFACTURING and PRESSING TECHNIQUES encompassing modern compact face powder, blusher. eyeliner, eyebrow, eyeshadow, and rouge are detailed. This paper briefly covers quality control, equipment requirements, manufacturing problems, fashions, and trends in pressed powder developments. INTROI) UCTION It was not until after World War I that the first pressed powder appeared on the market. The compact was a sixnple face powder molded into a pressed form by the addition of about 20 % of plaster of Paris. The resultant product was very rough in texture and difficult to use. It required a lot of rubbing in order to remove sufficient powder for application (1, 2). Later improvements included the use of various gum binding agents. Most compacts, however, turned out either too hard or too soft. The next major advance in pressed powder technology occurred in the early 1930 's when a facsimile of modern compact powder was prepared using petrolatum, ammonia, starch, and stearic acid as the binding agents (3).
