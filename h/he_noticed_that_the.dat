5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the suspect was Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E
5000|$|... 1636 — Jean de Brébeuf, a French Jesuit missionary, {{watches a}} Huron game of {{lacrosse}} {{in what is}} now Ontario, and <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sticks look like a bishop's crosier or [...] "la crosse" [...] in French.|$|R

50|$|A {{few years}} later, Stacy and Joey {{show up at}} Dr. Van Helsing's house {{to pick up their}} young daughter, whom they have named after Goody. As Van Helsing plays with his granddaughter, <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> little girl sports a set of vampire fangs.|$|R
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, Captain Glass arrived off {{the shore}} of Guam, and <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only ship in the harbor was a Japanese ship that was trading copra. Many of {{the men on the}} USS Charleston were {{disappointed}} that there were no Spanish ships to engage.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{experiments in}} RDF {{were carried out}} in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz discovered the directionality of an open loop of wire used as an antenna. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spark generated at the open gap between {{the ends of the}} loop was much stronger when the loop was end-on to the transmitter, and disappeared entirely when it was aligned face-on to the transmitter.|$|E

50|$|The victim, a petty {{con artist}} and relic hunter named Sheila Swegg, was found naked in a clearing, with her neck broken. A grisly tableau around the body, {{consisting}} of crows impaled on arrows, indicates {{the work of}} a serial killer. Pendergast surprises <b>the</b> police when <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arrows are genuine 19th century Cheyenne artifacts, and moreover are almost impossibly well-preserved.|$|R
25|$|After {{working in}} Switzerland on 9 and 10 March and {{recording}} a television special for the BBC on Saturday, 11 March 1978, François {{returned to his}} Paris apartment, 46 Boulevard Exelmans, to appear, the next day, on Les Rendez-vous du Dimanche with TV host Michel Drucker. While taking a shower, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light fixture was not straight on the wall; he tried to straighten it and was electrocuted.|$|E
25|$|Further {{groundbreaking}} {{work was}} carried out by William Harvey, who published De Motu Cordis in 1628. Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently like had been thought previously by his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Chevreul {{was perhaps}} the most {{important}} influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to restore a section properly was {{to take into account the}} influence of the colors around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.|$|E
5000|$|Nathan Quinn, {{a marine}} biologist, goes {{out on a}} routine day-trip {{expedition}} to survey whales in the area. When he photographs one of <b>the</b> whale's flukes, <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "BITE ME" [...] are spelled out in huge letters on the mammal's tail-fin. His curiosity and investigations uncover one mystery after another as he seeks the answers concerning {{the source of this}} peculiarity.|$|R

When a {{policeman}} who overheard his story comes in and rouses him, <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> handkerchief left behind by [...] "Wellington" [...] bears the initials JWB. John Wilkes Booth himself had drugged Peter to prevent any interference in his mission. He hears the crowd outside spreading <b>the</b> news <b>that</b> <b>the</b> president has just been shot.|$|R
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> common belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nine Yang Manual has Buddhist origins, Zhang Sanfeng {{begins to}} doubt this claim as he delves further into <b>the</b> text. <b>He</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{principles}} and {{philosophy of the}} skills depicted in the manual are very much Taoist in nature. He also points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manual was written in Chinese instead of Sanskrit, <b>the</b> language <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manual's alleged creator Bodhidharma would have used. Zhang develops the Taiji Fist based on the principles in the book.|$|R
25|$|Carpenter is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} founders of the modern theory of the adaptive unconscious. Together with William Hamilton and Thomas Laycock they provided the foundations on which adaptive unconscious is based today. They observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations have been made by Hermann Helmholtz. Because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were largely neglected, until the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. In 1874 Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that something was wrong with the ZETA results. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E
25|$|Polyvision {{was only}} {{used for the}} final reel of Napoleon, to create a climactic finale. Filming the whole story in Polyvision was logistically {{difficult}} as Gance wished {{for a number of}} innovative shots, each requiring greater flexibility than was allowed by three interlocked cameras. When the film was greatly trimmed by the distributors early on during exhibition, the new version only retained the center strip in order to allow projection in standard single-projector cinemas. Gance was unable to eliminate the problem of the two seams dividing the three panels of film as shown on screen, so he avoided the problem by putting three completely different shots together in some of the Polyvision scenes. When Gance viewed Cinerama {{for the first time in}} 1955, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> widescreen image was still not seamless, that the problem was not entirely fixed.|$|E
50|$|John is sent up river where a {{sickness}} is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans. <b>He</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Yakata have rice - {{which has been}} given to them by the miners - and he guesses correctly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> miners have poisoned the rice in order to get rid of <b>the</b> Yakata. Knowing <b>that</b> they will exact vengeance, John tells the Yakata what has happened. The Yakata wipe out the miners.|$|R
50|$|Antiochus, {{the son of}} King Seleucus, is pining away yet {{he would}} rather die than name {{the cause of his}} disease to his father. The doctor, Erasistratus, {{suspects}} love is behind Antiochus's suffering. <b>He</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prince's pulse rate increases when he sees Stratonice, a young woman intended as his father's bride, and further tests confirm his diagnosis. The doctor subtly reveals the truth to the king who is content to relinquish Stratonice to Antiochus to save his son's life and happiness.|$|R

Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> curtain is raised and he breaks to welcome the viewers to the show. On August 12, 2008, the spicy comment was replaced with a message from Mario Netas staff repudiating crime in Mexico where Good Bob says [...] "Ya Basta!" [...] (Enough!) for the shock of all the staff (and of the audience).|$|R
25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} the photoelectric effect {{and the production}} and reception of electromagnetic waves. He published these observations in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. However, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced glass with quartz, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Kocher became professor, {{he wanted}} to {{modernize}} the practices at the Bernese Inselspital. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old building did not suffice the modern standards and was too small – half of the patients seeking medical attention had to be turned away. In spring 1878, he visited several institutions around Europe to evaluate novel innovations for hospitals and implement them if possible in Bern. He wrote down his observations in a lengthy report for the Bernese government, giving instructions even for architectonic details. In a speech on 15 November 1878, he informed the general public about the pressing needs of a new hospital building. Finally, he used his call to Prague to pressure the government: He would only stay in Bern if he was either granted 75 beds in the new building or would get money to increase his facilities in the old building. Finally, {{in the winter of}} 1884/1885 the new building was finished and the Inselspital could be moved.|$|E
25|$|Like others before, Poincaré (1900) {{discovered}} a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying {{the conflict between}} the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. <b>He</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.|$|E
60|$|He rises unsteadily {{from the}} bed, lays the pipe upon the hearth-stone, draws back the ragged curtain, and looks with repugnance at his three companions. <b>He</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman has opium-smoked {{herself into a}} strange {{likeness}} of the Chinaman. His form of cheek, eye, and temple, and his colour, are repeated in her. Said Chinaman convulsively wrestles {{with one of his}} many Gods or Devils, perhaps, and snarls horribly. The Lascar laughs and dribbles at the mouth. The hostess is still.|$|R

5000|$|An impoverished Japanese painter sends his {{housekeeper}} {{out with}} a few small coins to buy food. Instead, she brings home a cat from <b>the</b> dock, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house is [...] "lonely". The painter is initially very unhappy with this choice, as he is hungry. He remarks that he cannot even remember what rice cakes taste like, and states that cats are devils. However, he is somewhat consoled when <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cat's white coat actually has three colors, which is considered lucky.|$|R
500|$|Molyneux {{stated that}} King Kong was an {{inspiration}} for the game Soon afterwards, watching the Outer Limits episode [...] "The Sandkings", <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> episode featured bug-like creatures worshipping a scientist, and who moved around him in reverence whenever he was nearby. Molyneux thought that being admired with that level of devotion made one a god.|$|E
500|$|When Strupper {{tried out}} for the team, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quarterback would shout the signals every time Strupper was to carry the ball. Realizing the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman, [...] "Coach, those loud signals are {{absolutely}} unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1737 and 1742, Richard Pococke, an English anthropologist, {{toured the}} Middle East and wrote {{of what he}} thought were ruins of {{defensive}} walls built with [...] stone blocks near the Awali river. When the French orientalist Ernest Renan visited the area in 1860, <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, Mission de Phénicie, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge.|$|E
