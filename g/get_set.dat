25|$|On 5 July, the 339th Squadron {{was pulled}} out of combat and {{returned}} to Johnson AB. Shortly afterwards, the 4th Squadron returned to Okinawa, with the 347th Provisional Group being inactivated {{and control of the}} 68th Squadron being turned over to the 8th Fighter Group. The 339th had been in combat a total of 10 days (26 June–5 July), flying a total of 44 combat sorties for which they had been given no training. The 68th Squadron was left to carry on the battle. Throughout July and August 1950, F-82s from the 68th Squadron attacked enemy trains, vehicles, and numerous buildings, and constantly strafed North Korean troops on the roads. On the night of 27 August, an element of F-82s was patrolling over South Korea over a thick overcast when they received an urgent request for air support from some hard-pressed ground troops. Darkness was approaching when they reached the area and found UN ground troops pinned down by a concentration of mortars. The F-82 pilots made several passes to <b>get</b> <b>set</b> up with the ground controller, {{and as soon as the}} enemy target was pinpointed, the heavily armed aircraft commenced an attack that would last 45 minutes and use up all their ordnance. When the aircraft pulled up for the last time, the mortar positions were silent and ground forces later showed over 300 enemy dead.|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} changed Logan's opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to Charlie Chaplin in {{her ability to}} blend comedy and tragedy. Bus Stop became a box office success, grossing $4.25 million, and received mainly favorable reviews. The Saturday Review of Literature wrote that Monroe's performance [...] "effectively dispels {{once and for all}} the notion that she is merely a glamour personality" [...] and Crowther proclaimed: [...] "Hold on to your chairs, everybody, and <b>get</b> <b>set</b> for a rattling surprise.

The soundtrack also includes [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] by The Fray and [...] "Running on Sunshine" [...] by Jesus Jackson, performed as ensemble pieces by Ramirez, McKidd, Wilson, Leigh, Daniel Sunjata, Scott Foley, Ellen Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Raver, Dane, and Capshaw.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it {{four out of}} five stars. Forcella praised the Jim–Dwight dynamic in the episode and wrote, [...] "Jim and Dwight, and especially the latter, were terrific." [...] In addition, Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie Bertam to Michael Scott, noting [...] "the most heartwarming moment [...] her scene with Pam, in which Nellie was so happy to have made a friend, reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, and a nice way to <b>get</b> <b>set</b> for the season/series finale. ...

500|$|The video {{features}} neither West, Jay Z or Ocean, {{but instead}} focuses on two groups: [...] "protestors and the police, both {{at war with}} one another. And yes, this is war — it's an unsettling and savage clip, depicting protestors being beaten and pepper-sprayed as they mercilessly combat with the police, though the protestors-turned-rioters also inflict {{a large part of}} the violence: they destroy property, loot stores, and set fire to cars — and humans. The video refuses to take sides, as there's no winner when a conflict turns to violence." [...] Young men are beaten, choked, sprayed with mace and dragged across the concrete as Frank Ocean soulfully croons, [...] "Will he make it out alive?" [...] in time with the staged anarchy. [...] By the end of the five-minute video, [...] "the freedom fighters seem to have notched a victory of some sort, standing in triumph in the face of their oppressors. But even if a single battle is won, there is no conclusive ending, meaning that the war still rages on." [...] Popping up at the end of the clip is an actual elephant, chained at the neck and trying to resist getting choked to death. Pitchfork gave the clip a positive review, however noted [...] "Kanye's [...] "you will not control the threesome"/"never fuck nobody without telling me" [...] verse seems pretty out of place when you're watching a cop <b>get</b> <b>set</b> on fire." ...|$|E

The {{original}} 30-minute reel-to-reel audio tape recording was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus. At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, [...] "Right here! <b>Get</b> <b>Set!</b> Point! Fire!". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings and was one of those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna Record-Courier newspaper in May 2007: [...] "I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that." [...] Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order, [...] Shafer went on to say, [...] "That's not to say there may not have been, but with all the racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day." [...] Shafer also said that [...] "point" [...] would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation took several steps to ensure {{the validity of the}} participants. [...] Each veteran's authenticity was checked before the hearings by the investigation event organizers, and subsequently by reporters and Pentagon officials. In addition, they also gave specific details about their units and the locations where the events had occurred. [...] Those who wanted to testify were carefully screened by the officers of VVAW, and care was taken to verify the service records and testimony of the veterans. After the severe criticism of the accuracy of Mark Lane's book about atrocities a month before the event, the {{organizers of}} the Winter Soldier Investigation made the credibility of the participants a top priority. [...] As noted by one VVAW leader, [...] "The lesson is that we'd better do our work right. We'd better talk to these vets and weed out the bullshitters so that we can't <b>get</b> <b>set</b> up, because we're going to come under attack. [...] We're going to do this right." [...] All veterans participating in Winter Soldier were required to bring their discharge papers (DD-214's) and IDs.|$|E

Have something to say, and say it, was the Duke of Wellington's theory of style; Huxley's was to say that which has to be said in such language that you can stand cross-examination on each word.
