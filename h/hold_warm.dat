Indeed, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying thermoregulation may be shared by those that regulate social warmth, the experience of feeling connected to other people. To test this possibility, we placed participants in a functional MRI scanner {{and asked them to}} (a) read socially warm and neutral messages from friends and family and (b) <b>hold</b> <b>warm</b> and neutral-temperature objects (a warm pack and a ball, respectively). Findings showed an overlap between physical and social warmth: Participants felt warmer after reading the positive (compared with neutral) messages and more connected after holding the warm pack (compared with the ball). In addition, neural activity during social warmth overlapped with neural activity during physical warmth in the ventral striatum and middle insula, but neural activity did not overlap during another pleasant task (soft touch). Together, these results suggest that a common neural mechanism underlies physical and social warmth. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|E

To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS) : 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23. 8 petagrams of CO 2 equivalent (PgCO 2 e) y− 1 (95 % CI 20. 3 – 37. 4).

The report show that significant significant climate and development impacts are already being felt in some regions, {{and in some cases}} multiple threats of increasing extreme heat waves, sea level rise, more severe storms, droughts and floods are expected to have further severe negative implications for the poorest. These impacts are likely to push many vulnerable households below the poverty trap threshold with high temperature extreme's negative impact on the yields of food crops.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a snapshot of}} recent scientific literature and new analyses of likely impacts and risks that {{would be associated with}} a 4 ° Celsius warming within this century.   It is a rigorous attempt to outline a range of risks, focusing on developing countries and especially the poor. A 4 °C world would be one of unprecedented heat waves, severe drought, and major floods in many regions, with serious impacts on ecosystems and associated services.  But with action, a 4 °C world can be avoided and we can likely <b>hold</b> <b>warming</b> below 2 °C. Without further commitments and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the world is likely to warm by more than 3 °C above the preindustrial climate. Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4 °C by 2100. If they are not met, a warming of 4 °C could occur as early as the 2060 s. Such a warming level and associated sea-level rise of 0. 5 to 1 meter, or more, by 2100 would not be the end point: a further warming to levels over 6 °C, with several meters of sea-level rise, would likely occur over the following centuries...|$|R
40|$|Sea-level rise (SLR) is a {{critical}} and uncertain climate change risk, involving timescales of centuries(1). Here we use a semi-empirical model, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium(2), to estimate the SLR implications of <b>holding</b> <b>warming</b> below 2 degrees C or 1. 5 degrees C above pre-industrial temperature, as mentioned in the Cancun Agreements(3). Limiting warming to these levels with a probability larger than 50 % produces 75 - 80 cm SLR above the year 2000 by 2100. This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale owing to inertia in the climate system and the differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300 a 1. 5 degrees C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1. 5 m above 2000. The 50 % probability scenario for 2 degrees C warming would see sea level reaching 2. 7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate.

40|$|Recent work on {{embodied}} cognition {{has shown}} that percep-tions of interpersonal intimacy are conceptually grounded in physical temperature.

Such results suggest that temperature and intimacy are psychologi-cally interchangeable (cf. Williams & Bargh, 2008). Activating one, through either physical experience or semantic priming (e. g., IJzerman & Semin, 2010), produces changes in the other. Such results are also reminiscent of classic work on the impor-tance of temperature for attachment bonds (Harlow, 1958), {{which means that they}} may be useful for understanding attach-ment processes.

40|$|This study compares {{emission}} pathways {{aimed at}} limiting temperature increase to 2 °C under varying constraints. In a {{first set of}} pathways, the timing of emission reductions is such that over the 2010 – 2100 period, assuming full participation from 2013 onwards, mitigation costs are minimized. In {{a second set of}} pathways, we set emissions in 2020 at a level based on the pledges of the Copenhagen Accord. In the ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario, climate talks result in satisfying conditions linked by countries to their ‘most ambitious’ proposals. Contrasting, in the ‘Copenhagen Current’ scenario, climate talks fall short of satisfying the conditions to move beyond current unilateral pledges. We include scenarios with and without the availability of bio-energy in combination with carbon capture and storage. We find that for a ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario, emissions by 2020 are higher (47 GtCO 2 eq/yr) than for a least-cost pathway for 2 °C (43 GtCO 2 eq/yr with a 40 – 46 GtCO 2 eq/yr literature range). In the ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario the 2 °C target can still be met with a likely chance, although discounted mitigation costs over 2010 – 2100 could be 10 to 15 % higher, and up to 60 % in the 2040 – 2050 s, than for least-cost pathways. For the ‘Current Copenhagen’ scenario, maintaining an equally low probability of exceeding 2 °C becomes infeasible in our model, implying higher costs due to higher climate risks. We conclude that there is some flexibility in terms of 2020 emissions compared to the optimal pathways but this is limited. The 2020 emission level represents a trade-off between short-term emission reductions and long-term dependence on rapid reductions through specific technologies (like negative emission reductions). Higher 2020 emissions lead to higher overall costs and reduced long-term flexibility, both leading to a higher risk of failing to <b>hold</b> <b>warming</b> below 2 °C...|$|R

40|$|Without {{further and}} {{accelerated}} action it appears {{very likely that}} global greenhouse gas emission levels in 2020 will be far above those {{that are consistent with}} agreed international warming goals. This gap between where emissions are headed and where they need to be is now widely acknowledged by the international community and at COP 17 in Durban a work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition was launched to explore options for strengthening efforts by all Parties. In this context, this briefing paper explores a range of issues, options and strategies for bridging the 2020 emissions gap as a matter of urgency. We begin by reviewing some of the recent science in relation to limiting warming to the agreed warming goals, and the relative role of different greenhouse gases and other climate forcing agents. The scientific analysis in this paper is new in that it integrates insights from the recent reports published by the United Nations Environment Programme, relating to hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions, action on methane and action to reduce air pollution in the context of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with <b>holding</b> <b>warming</b> to below 2 °C, and ultimately to 1. 5 °C. Another innovative feature of this briefing paper then follows with a practical analysis of a range of initiatives that, taken together, could have the potential to bring emissions from present projected levels to those that are consistent with 2 °C warming limit and assist national governments to implement and strengthen their emission reduction pledges. We provide an overview of such initiatives -often led by players other than national governments and in many cases driven by concerns broader than climate change. Together, these initiatives could have the potential to bridge the emissions gap. Finally we highlight further work needed to elaborate on the scientific issues, mitigation options and barriers to their achievement in order to realise the possibilities outlined in the paper...|$|R
