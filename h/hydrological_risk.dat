This paper is focused on the identification of the main socioeconomic elements vulnerable to <b>hydrological</b> <b>risk</b> phenomena such as floods, based on the assessment of their manifestation potential. Thus, following the delimitation of areas with the highest flood occurrence potential (susceptibility to floods), major socioeconomic factors existing in the basin, considering human settlements (constructions), transport infrastructure, and agricultural areas (the most important category), were superimposed.

The <b>hydrological</b> <b>risk</b> that has a major impact upon the human settlements in the area, is conditioned {{by the presence of}} floods which frequently occur in the rivers flood plain. In this present study, we have emphasised the floods that took placebetween 2005 and 2008, including the maximum maximorum run-off rate of 456 m³/s, recorded at the Dumbrava hydrometric station, in 2005. By utilising the data gathered from the hydrometric stations, located on the Ozana river valley, we have analysed the propagation of the flood waves generated in the three sectors of the drainage basin: the upper, middle and lower sector. After the analysis, we have observed the fact that the area that was most affected by thefloods is the upstream river sector, where numerous households and roads have been flooded. Another aspect of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>risk</b> is related to the minimum run-off of the Ozana river, which is influenced by climatic conditions and alluvial deposits from the riverbed. Therefore, during draughts, taking into considerationthe presence of very thick Quaternary deposits, the river runs dry on its lower course, for a variable period of time, which can be from a few days, to six months, every year.

Particularly, the uncertainties involved in the second goal have not yet received significant consideration. The designed framework for <b>hydrological</b> <b>risk</b> analysis related to flood and extreme precipitation events is exemplarily applied in two catchments of the Loess plateau, China. Results show that (1) distribution derived by the maximum entropy principle outperforms the conventional distributions for the probabilistic modeling of flood and extreme precipitation events; (2) the bivariate return periods, risk, reliability and bivariate design events are able to be derived using the coupled entropy-copula method; (3) uncertainty analysis highlights the fact that appropriate performance of marginal distribution is closely related to bivariate design event identification. Most importantly, sampling uncertainty causes the confidence regions of bivariate design events with return periods of 30 years to be very large, overlapping with the values of flood and extreme precipitation, which have return periods of 10 and 50 years, respectively. The large confidence regions of bivariate design events greatly challenge its application in practical engineering design...|$|E

Here we focus on farmers ’ decision-making process to cope with drought consequences on crop production. The un-derstanding of the dynamics of droughts and water scarcity is being improved continuously and new indicators are used to link science to policy actions. This paper analyses the effects of drought management plans on maize produc-tion in the Ebro river basin to compute the willingness to pay of the farmers for hypothetical <b>hydrological</b> <b>risk</b> insur-ance.

Here new MDB rainfall reconstructions are presented based on a novel method using paleoclimate rainfall proxies in the Australasian region spanning from 749 B. C. E. to 1980 C. E.

Some reconstructed rainfalls exceeded the instrumental range (i. e., drier dry epochs and wetter wet spells) despite a systematic underestimation of extremes due to a combination of proxy quality and model bias.
