Using a broad definition of access, based on the WHO <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improved water source, access {{in rural areas}} in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E

5|$|The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> island used in {{this list}} {{is that it is}} 'land that is {{surrounded}} by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways'. There are four islands joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of causeways known as the Churchill Barriers. They are South Ronaldsay, Burray, Lamb Holm and Glims Holm. In addition, Hunda is connected to Burray by a causeway. The barriers were constructed by Italian prisoners-of-war as a means of preventing enemy submarine access to the vast natural harbour of Scapa Flow after the sinking of HMS Royal Oak by a German U-boat in 1939 with the loss of 883 lives. The Italian prisoners constructed a small Roman Catholic chapel on Lamb Holm as a place of worship during their incarceration.|$|E

50|$|The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> LIMS is {{somewhat}} controversial: LIMSs are dynamic because the laboratory's requirements are rapidly evolving and different labs often have different needs.

30|$|The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell {{assembly}} {{tells us that}} it only takes <b>a</b> fraction <b>of</b> the assembly to get excited in order to excite the entire assembly. However, the motivation and focus of our work comes {{from the study of}} cell assemblies generated by tight sets that are minimal, that is, the deletion of any node from the set generates a subset that is not tight. In addition, the mathematical <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{cell assembly}} for its study on simple graphs follows the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> k-core. According to Palm’s <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tight set, <b>a</b> particular type <b>of</b> tight set is a minimal k-core.

25|$|Conventions {{regarding}} the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> algebraic variety differ slightly.

Under this definition, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets. Other conventions do not require irreducibility.|$|E
