500|$|Danny Bennett {{felt that}} younger audiences who were {{unfamiliar}} {{with his father}} would respond to his music if given a chance. No changes to Tony's formal appearance, singing style, musical accompaniment (The Ralph Sharon Trio or an orchestra), or song choice (generally the Great American Songbook) were necessary or desirable. Accordingly, Danny began regularly to book his father on [...] Late Night with David Letterman, a show with a younger, [...] "hip" [...] audience. This was subsequently followed by appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Simpsons, Muppets Tonight, and various MTV programs. In 1993, Bennett played a series of benefit concerts organized by alternative rock radio stations around the country. The plan worked; as Tony later remembered, [...] "I realized that young people had never <b>heard</b> <b>those</b> songs. Cole Porter, Gershwin [...] they were like, 'Who wrote that?' To them, it was different. If you're different, you stand out." ...|$|E

[...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let me tell you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you <b>heard</b> <b>those</b> words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] <b>heard</b> <b>those</b> lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

"Frosti" [...] fades into [...] "Aurora", while [...] "a warm, faintly crunchy sound" [...] is <b>heard.</b> <b>Those</b> are {{samples of}} {{footprints}} in the snow — the work of Matmos —, re-appropriated as the song's [...] "subtly shifting beat". [...] "Aurora" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "something that appeals to a child-like imagination", and having a [...] "magical and airy quality". In the lyrics, she addresses a Nature goddess, and sings about [...] "literally dissolving with pleasure" [...] as she [...] "prays to become one with the pure color of the northern lights". One of Björk's broodiest compositions, [...] "An Echo, a Stain" [...] is underpinned by a creeping choir line and nibbling clicks, and features an [...] "unresolved, ominous tension" [...] that is atypical of her writing style. Most of the song's lyrics speak directly to incidents in Sarah Kane's 1998 dark-themed play Crave, so much so that it was titled [...] "Crave" [...] up to the last minute. [...] "Sun in My Mouth" [...] is an adaptation of E.E. Cummings' poem [...] "I will wade out/Till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers", with an emphasis on the vocal and accompaniment provided by a string orchestra, a harp, and soft electronica. The track's lyrics have been considered a [...] "startling allusion to masturbation", positioned [...] "within the fantasy-like imagery of burning flowers, sea-girls, darkness and the sun". This track, and the album in general, have a [...] "resounding message of sexual liberation" [...] that reinforces Björk's [...] "resistance to the socially constructed categories of gender," [...] which has generated analysis associating it with Donna Haraway's 1983 essay, A Cyborg Manifesto.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} the Israelites {{heard the words}} of the first two commandments (in [...] (20:2–3 in NJPS) and [...] (5:7–8 in NJPS)) {{directly}} from God. Rabbi Simlai expounded that a total of 613 commandments were communicated to Moses — 365 negative commandments, corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. Rav Hamnuna said that one may derive this from [...] "Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob." [...] The letters of the word [...] "Torah" [...] (...) have a numerical value of 611 (as [...] equals 400, [...] equals 6, [...] equals 200, and [...] equals 5).

2500|$|Muslims fulfill this {{religious}} obligation {{by giving}} a fixed {{percentage of their}} surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed {{on the same level}} of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer (salat). Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business. In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich. Because it holds such a high level of importance the [...] "punishment" [...] for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam it states, [...] "...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted". This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting <b>heard,</b> <b>those</b> who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.|$|E
