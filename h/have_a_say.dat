Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E
5|$|An Assembly of Notables (the members {{consisted}} of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 {{to ratify the}} financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, the opportunity he had long been waiting for to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies that would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.|$|E

The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one}} who went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a small-scale, {{qualitative}} study on children 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives about their participation in decision-making processes regarding supervised contact. The paper begins with {{an overview of the}} study and a summary of findings in relation to four key research questions framed around the idea of children <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say,</b> that is, children 2 ̆ 7 s views and perspectives of their participation in family law decision-making processes. These key questions include: What are children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> What are children 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> Did children want <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the decision for them to have supervised contact? How did having (or not <b>having)</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> feel? Discussion focuses on what importance children place on <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in family law matters, a finding that is contrasted with children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of marginalisation and exclusion from decision-making processes and of ambivalence and reluctance sometimes expressed around <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say.</b> Children 2 ̆ 7 s idea of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> as taking place in and through particular forms of dialogue and conversation, thus enabling the recognition of children and respect for what they have to say, are also explored. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of the study for professionals working in family la...|$|R

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|After peace returned, Gibraltar {{underwent}} {{major changes}} during the reformist governorship of General Sir George Don, who {{took up his}} position in 1814. The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding St Bernard's Hospital to serve the civilian population and initiating {{the construction of the}} Cathedral of the Holy Trinity to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians. For the first time, civilians began to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers. A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a Crown colony. In the same year, the Gibraltar Police Force was established, modelled on London's pioneering Metropolitan Police Service, and a Supreme Court was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.|$|E

The JLP group is the third largest UK non-traded company by sales in the Sunday Times Top Track 100 for 2016. The chain's image is upmarket, and it appeals strongly to middle- and upper-class shoppers. Recently, John Lewis has broadened its marketing strategy towards all types of buyers, with the introduction of the 'Value' range to John Lewis and the 'Essential' range to Waitrose, and the expansion of the business.|$|E
25|$|Filipescu {{was again}} in Bucharest during the {{resumption}} {{of war and the}} period leading up to Germany's surrender. His father had founded Epoca newspaper in 1885, and in September 1918, the son decided to revive the moribund outfit, buying the trademark from its nominal owner, Timoleon Pisani. Filipescu and Constantin Argetoianu identified two financiers, Aristide Blank and Jean Chrissoveloni. In exchange for backing from the latter two, the newspaper owners joined the administration of Marmorosch Blank Bank, alongside Duca, Toma Stelian, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. Blank's involvement would fuel the suspicions of antisemitic groups that the newspaper was a tool of the Jews. While Blank's influence was exaggerated, he did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the editorial policy. For instance, when an article critical of Liviu Rebreanu was slated to appear, the financier convinced Filipescu not to run the story. Instead, in 1919 Epoca published a dossier on Marghiloman's wartime stances.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, Chomsky {{developed}} a dislike {{of capitalism and}} the selfish pursuit of material advancement.

He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic, because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in public economic policy.

25|$|Raumer {{presented}} his ideas on public libraries, termed as Volksbibliotheken (people's libraries), in a memorandum in 1846, resonating his democratic opinions. As a result, in 1847 Berlin's magistrate (city government) established a standing {{committee for the}} establishment and administration of public libraries, consisting {{of members of the}} afore-mentioned Verein and of the City Representatives' Assembly (Stadtverordnetenversammlung; then Berlin's city parliament). The Bibliotheks-Kommission (Library Commission) was to appoint the chief librarian, control the library budget and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the book purchases. In December 1848 King Frederick William IV approved the foundation of public libraries, however, his decision remained unpublished due to the repercussions of the March Revolution of that year. The Prussian government added the clause that all works suited to endanger ethical life, religion or the state were strictly to be withheld from the library, while books apt to strengthen traditions, faith and the king's subjects' fidelity were to be preferentially acquired. Starting in 1849 , the city's archivist, served as responsible city official for the Library Commission, and soon determined its acquisitions of books.|$|E
25|$|Kurds {{have been}} well {{integrated}} in Iranian political life {{during the reign of}} various governments. Kurdish liberal political Karim Sanjabi has served as minister of education under Mohammad Mossadegh in 1952. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi some members of parliament and high army officers were Kurds, and there was even a Kurdish Cabinet Minister. During Pahlavi reign Kurds allegedly received many favours from the authorities, for instance to keep their land after the land reforms of 1962. In the early 2000s, the supposed presence of thirty Kurdish deputies in the 290-strong parliament has allegedly shown that Kurds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in Iranian politics. Some of influential Kurdish politicians during recent years include former first vice president Mohammad Reza Rahimi and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Mayor of Tehran and second-placed presidential candidate in 2013. Kurdish language is today used more {{than at any other time}} since the Revolution, including in several newspapers and among schoolchildren. Large number of Kurds in Iran show no interest in Kurdish nationalism, especially Shia Kurds who even vigorously reject idea of autonomy, preferring direct rule from Tehran. Iranian national identity is questioned only in the peripheral Kurdish Sunni regions.|$|E
25|$|OBE was {{introduced}} to South Africa in the late 1990s by the post-apartheid government {{as part of its}} Curriculum 2005 program. , Initial support for the program derived from anti-apartheid education policies. The policy also gained support from the labor movements that borrowed ideas about competency-based education, and Vocational education from New Zealand and Australia, as well as the labor movement that critiqued the apartheid education system. With no strong alternative proposals, the idea of outcome-based education, and a national qualification framework, became the policy of the African National Congress government. This policy was believed to be a democratization of education, people would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in what they wanted the outcomes of education to be. It was also believed to be a way to increase education standards and increase the availability of education. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) went into effect in 1997. In 2001 people realized that the intended effects were not being seen. By 2006 no proposals to change the system had been accepted by the government, causing a hiatus of the program. The program came to be viewed as a failure and a new curriculum improvement process was announced in 2010, slated to be implemented between 2012 and 2014.|$|E

500|$|After {{the death}} of Ravana, Rama advises Vibhishana to take Mandodari as his wife, even though he already has a wife.
