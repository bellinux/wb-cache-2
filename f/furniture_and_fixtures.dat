5|$|By this time, {{the company}}, perpetually undercapitalized {{by its own}} admission, faced {{mounting}} financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an indemnity bond to avoid the impoundment of President Arthur for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit. The following month, President Arthur was used as collateral for $100,000 loan from a Bronx bank, {{but it was too}} little, too late. American Palestine Line was placed in receivership on September 11 by federal judge Thomas D. Thacher of the U.S. District Court after suit was brought by a creditor. Eight days later, President Arthur, docked at the foot of West 34th Street, experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the New York City Fire Department fireboat James Duane. In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings, charges the company denied. By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, President Arthur was back {{in the hands of the}} USSB, and the <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> of the American Palestine offices were sold at public auction by the company's receiver in early March 1926.|$|E

25|$|Rectangles {{have been}} the most popular and common {{geometric}} form for buildings since the shape is easy to stack and organize; as a standard, it is easy to design <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> to fit inside rectangularly shaped buildings. But triangles, while more difficult to use conceptually, provide a great deal of strength. As computer technology helps architects design creative new buildings, triangular shapes are becoming increasingly prevalent as parts of buildings and as the primary shape for some types of skyscrapers as well as building materials. In Tokyo in 1989, architects had wondered whether it was possible to build a 500-story tower to provide affordable office space for this densely packed city, but with the danger to buildings from earthquakes, architects considered that a triangular shape would have been necessary if such a building was ever to have been built (it hasn't by 2011).|$|E

The wash basin was made of marble, and was firmly set in its place, so as to be absolutely immovable. There was a hole in the bottom of it, with a plug in it, so that, by drawing out the plug, the water could be let off into a pipe which conveyed it away. There was a small chain attached to this plug, by means of which it could be drawn up when any one wished to let the water off. The pitcher was made broad and flat at the bottom, and very heavy, so that it could not be easily upset; {{and then there was a}} socket for it in the lower part of the wash stand, which confined it effectually, and prevented its sliding about when the ship was rolling in a heavy sea.|$|E
