After a bottleneck, inbreeding <b>increases.</b> This <b>increases</b> {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection.

5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core <b>increases</b> in mass and temperature.

5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart <b>increases</b> fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process <b>increases</b> the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS <b>increases</b> uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then <b>increases</b> oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption <b>increases,</b> ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration <b>increases</b> dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
