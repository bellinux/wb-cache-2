30|$|The {{experimental}} setup {{involves an}} aeration tank having dimensions 1  m[*]×[*] 1  m[*]×[*] 1  m with a water circulating arrangement through a pipe of diameter 50  mm {{connected to a}} centrifugal pump, a flow regulating valve to control the rate of flow, a calibrated orifice meter to measure discharge of water flowing through pipe, and a thermometer to measure the temperature {{of water in the}} tank. Tap water was used for all the experiments, and the level of water in aeration tank was maintained constant nearly at 0.65  m. Hollow jet aerating device connected to the outlet of vertical pipe was installed at a height of 0.1  m from the water surface throughout the experimentation. The experiments were conducted with jet velocities ranging from 0.7 to 4.77  m/s under a discharge range of 2.3 to 3.6  L/s. Thickness of jet was manually adjusted by scaling the vertical opening between pipe outlet and aerator end. For obtaining the amount of oxygen transferred to water in the tank for a particular jet aerator, a known volume of water was filled in the tank. An estimated quantity of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) along with cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) as catalyst was added to bring dissolved oxygen level of water in the tank between 1.0 and 2.0  mg/L (Deswal 2008), and a sample of water was taken for initial DO (C 0) measurement. Then, the aerator was allowed to run for a specified period of time. (It was ensured that the device was run for a period (t) that DO of water in the tank does not reach the saturation value at the test temperature, T°C, and the final DO (Ct) was then measured.) Two samples are collected from the tank for final <b>DO</b> <b>determination,</b> and the average DO value of two samples is considered as final DO (Ct). The temperature of water in the tank is measured by a mercury thermometer with a minimum accuracy of ±[*] 0.1  °C. The procedure was repeated for various runs of observations by using different jet aerators. The value of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) was then estimated.|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{eutrophication}} {{is caused}} by the excess addition of phosphorus to aquatic ecosystems, and has long been a water quality management issue in Lake Erie. Despite successful reductions in external loading of phosphorus in Lake Erie the in lake total phosphorus (TP) concentrations are increasing recently and symptoms of eutrophication are apparent. In this study I examined the sedimentation velocity of particulate phosphorus and how it is affected by stratification and plankton community composition over the growing season. Diatoms had the highest sedimentation velocities and a shift to slower settling species with greater form resistance (Synedra sp. and Fragilaria sp.) was observed during the stratified period possibly in response to the shallower mixed layer. No significant variation in sedimentation velocity was found with trap depth, plankton size or temperature; hence the individual plankton cells were employing methods to change their sedimentation velocity in accordance with changing environmental conditions. Phosphorus sedimentation was most closely related to silica sedimentation, which largely represents the sedimentation of the diatoms. Thus any shifts in community composition will affect phosphorus-settling rates. The sedimentation rate of phosphorus decreased from June 2 nd until August 26 th during the stratified period at station 84 and from June 2 nd to August 5 th at station 452. The decline of total phosphorus was less than the sedimentation rate, hence, sediment resuspension and redistribution from the littoral sediments along with atmospheric deposition are important sources of phosphorus to the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie. The sedimentation rates of P, N and C did not follow the Redfield ratio. The sedimentation velocity of P was much less than that of C and N, indicating that P is conserved in the epilimnion and possibly that C and sedimentation contains more non-living material. Therefore, modelling phosphorus sedimentation after carbon and nitrogen sedimentation is inappropriate. Laboratory sedimentation towers can be used to measure phytoplankton sedimentation velocity including net upward movement, which traditional sedimentation traps are unable to <b>do.</b> <b>Determination</b> of the sedimentation velocity of the phytoplankton community to variables such as light, temperature and nutrient status, using this method, may eventually lead to a dynamic phosphorus model that could more effectively reduce eutrophication effects in Lake Erie...|$|E

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed {{the formation of}} > C=O functional group on electrode surface during the preanodization procedure at 2. 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The existence of chloride moieties was also identified possibly from the organic binder of carbon ink used in SPE fabrication.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy verified the enhanced kinetic rate of oxygen reduction reaction at the as-prepared Pd nanoparticles. The SPE*-Pd showed ca. 250 mV positive shift in peak potential together with twice increase in peak current compared to those observed at a SPE-Pt.

40|$|Abstract:- GPS {{receivers}} {{have been}} profitably employed by researchers for investigations into ionospheric and atmospheric science. However, {{a number of}} improvements in measurement accuracy are necessary for today’s applications. The ionosphere has practical importance in GPS applications because it influences transionospheric radio wave propagation. Total Electron Content (TEC) {{is one of the}} parameters of the ionosphere that produces the most effects in many radio applications such as radio communications, navigation and space weather. Delays in GPS signals affect the accuracy of GPS positioning. The determination of the TEC will aid in reliable space-based navigation system. By modelling this TEC parameter, the evaluation of the ionospheric error and the correction of these ionospheric errors for differential GPS can be <b>done.</b> <b>Determination</b> of the differential ionospheric error to sub-centimetre accuracy is described in this paper utilizing a developed model. An ionospheric delay model was developed to accurately determine the difference in ionospheric delay expected over a short baseline so that a more accurate differential GPS correction could be made. An ionospheric error correction model should be made applicable to any location including the equatorial region. The results showed that the developed algorithm is a function of elevation angle and TEC from the referenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} {{for the production of}} extra-embryonic fluids with hemolytic activity from chick embryos infected with mumps virus have been investigated. Infected fluids with strong hemolytic activity can be obtained by harvesting the fluids of 6 - to 8 -day-old chick embryos inoculated by the amniotic route after 5 to 6 days' incubation at 35 °C. Under such circumstances, the hemolytic capacity of amniotic fluids is usually much higher than that of the allantoic fluids. The hemolytic activity and infectivity of the virus {{have been found to be}} reduced or destroyed by heat, formaldehyde, and ultraviolet irradiation under conditions which leave the hemagglutinating capacity practically unchanged. Ultraviolet irradiation appeared to have a greater deleterious effect on the infectivity of the virus than on its hemolytic capacity. The marked reduction or destruction of hemolytic activity of the virus produced by certain treatments with these various agencies was not accompanied by loss of the ability of the virus to elute following its adsorption on red blood cells during the process of hemagglutination. This test for hemolytic activity, which measures a more labile property of the virus than <b>do</b> <b>determinations</b> of virus hemagglutination or virus elution, may be useful in detecting changes which occur early during degradation of the virus...|$|R
