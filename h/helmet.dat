5|$|Deep sea diving is {{underwater}} diving, {{usually with}} surface supplied equipment, and often {{refers to the}} use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper <b>helmet.</b> Hard hat diving is any form of diving with a <b>helmet,</b> including the standard copper <b>helmet,</b> and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets.|$|E
5|$|He sported one-off <b>helmet</b> designs four times. For the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he {{replaced}} the German flag with a chequered flag motif and reflective silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, the German flag design {{was replaced with}} an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian Grand Prix race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final Grand Prix), he wore an all-red <b>helmet</b> that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories. For the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed <b>helmet.</b> The <b>helmet,</b> very similar to his current <b>helmet,</b> included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven World titles. For the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 300th Grand Prix appearance, he wore a special platinum-leafed <b>helmet</b> with a message of his achievement.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Roman <b>helmet</b> ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached. The <b>helmet</b> would {{originally}} have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of {{which is similar to}} that of the 3rd-century Guisborough <b>Helmet,</b> discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of the <b>helmet</b> bowl descended to form a neckguard.|$|E
50|$|Flight <b>helmets</b> {{were also}} {{developed}} throughout the 20th century. A multitude of athletic <b>helmets,</b> including football <b>helmets,</b> batting <b>helmets,</b> cricket <b>helmets,</b> bicycle <b>helmets,</b> motorcycle <b>helmets</b> and racing <b>helmets,</b> were also {{developed in the}} 20th century.|$|R

5|$|On 7 October 2010, the <b>helmet</b> {{was sold}} at Christie's for £2.3million (US$3.6million) to an {{undisclosed}} private buyer. Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery in Carlisle sought {{to purchase the}} <b>helmet,</b> {{with the support of}} the British Museum but was outbid. The <b>helmet</b> has so far been publicly displayed twice, once in a 2012 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, and again at Tullie House in 2013–14.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett <b>Helmet</b> is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry <b>helmet</b> {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010. Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied {{the site where the}} <b>helmet</b> was discovered, which was located a few miles away from a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible that the owner of the <b>helmet</b> was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett <b>helmet</b> is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry <b>helmet.</b> The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The <b>helmet</b> would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the <b>helmet,</b> below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the <b>helmet</b> was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead <b>Helmet</b> and Ribchester <b>Helmet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the season, {{the team}} changed from white <b>helmets</b> and powder blue jerseys—which it had had since its {{inception}} in 1960—to royal blue <b>helmets</b> and jerseys. Players' uniform numbers were also removed from the <b>helmets.</b> The royal blue would remain through 1984, when the <b>helmets</b> and jerseys became a darker shade of blue; that blue became even darker in 1988. The Chargers switched back permanently to modified white <b>helmets</b> in 2007.|$|R
50|$|A new colour {{scheme for}} <b>helmets</b> was {{introduced}} in August 2013, and rolled out in late 2013. Previously, yellow <b>helmets</b> were issued to Firefighters and Station Officers, white <b>helmets</b> to Chief Fire Officers, Area Commanders and Assistant National Commanders, with markings being the only discerning features. The changes saw Station Officer <b>helmets</b> change to red (trainee firefighter <b>helmets,</b> which were red, changed to green), and Area Commander and Assistant National Commander <b>helmets</b> change to silver. The change was {{to make it easier}} to identify the command structure at a large-scale, multi-agency incident.|$|R
50|$|In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health {{created an}} online study {{released}} by the Journal of Neurosurgery in which various football <b>helmets</b> were compared with each other via crash test dummies. It was also found that leather <b>helmets</b> provided similar results to modern <b>helmets,</b> and in some cases, the leather <b>helmets</b> proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather <b>helmets</b> did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.|$|R
5|$|The Gevninge <b>helmet</b> {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish <b>helmet</b> from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of the <b>helmet.</b> Three holes {{on the top and}} {{on the bottom of the}} fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her <b>helmet</b> was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the <b>helmet,</b> and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the <b>helmet</b> were not a separate piece affixed to the <b>helmet,</b> expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the <b>helmet,</b> which made the <b>helmet</b> legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's <b>helmet</b> design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His <b>helmet</b> was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his <b>helmet</b> stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his <b>helmet,</b> placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his <b>helmet</b> in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Numerous Urartian <b>helmets</b> {{have been}} recovered, more than 20 alone during the {{excavations}} of Teishebaini. Royal ceremonial <b>helmets</b> {{did not differ}} in shape from simple combat <b>helmets</b> but contained engraved images.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Helmets</b> (Quechua: Uma chucu): Mostly wooden, {{some were}} {{reinforced}} with copper. Copper <b>helmets</b> {{were used by}} generals and high-ranking officers, wood <b>helmets</b> {{could be used by}} regulars if they found them comfortable.|$|R
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Dodgers, Rickey {{was offered the}} {{position}} of general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 1953 season, the Pirates became {{the first team to}} permanently adopt batting <b>helmets</b> on both offense and defense. These <b>helmets</b> resembled a primitive fiberglass [...] "miner's cap". This was the mandate of Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing the <b>helmets.</b> Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the <b>helmets</b> both at bat and in the field. The <b>helmets</b> became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of <b>helmets</b> on defense, partly because of their awkwardly heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the <b>helmets</b> on defense, the trend disappeared from the game.|$|R
5|$|A valve ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric valve in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the <b>helmet</b> during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the <b>helmet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the <b>helmet</b> still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the <b>helmet</b> was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the <b>helmet</b> was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving <b>helmet.</b> Beebe continued to perform <b>helmet</b> dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his <b>helmet</b> dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

50|$|Early {{lacrosse}} players did {{not wear}} <b>helmets.</b> When lacrosse was {{played at the}} 1908 Summer Olympics, neither of the competing teams wore <b>helmets.</b> At the 1928, 1932 and 1948 Olympics where lacrosse was a demonstration sport, only the United States wore <b>helmets</b> while the opposing teams did not. The 1928 Olympics was the first documented use of lacrosse <b>helmets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vendel-era <b>helmets</b> from Sweden often {{features}} bird-motifs. On these <b>helmets</b> {{however, the}} it's a stylized noseguard or more often a winged man whose wings form [...] "eye-brows" [...] around the eye holes of the <b>helmets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Leicester County Council {{was able}} to raise £1 million to buy the entire hoard and pay for the {{conservation}} of the <b>helmet,</b> with the assistance of donations from the Heritage Lottery Fund (which gave a £650,000 grant), the Art Fund and other trusts and charities. The <b>helmet</b> was valued at £300,000; {{under the terms of the}} Treasure Act, Ken Wallace and the landowner were each awarded £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre {{would have had to}} be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge <b>helmet</b> fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a <b>helmet</b> meant for more than just protection.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its <b>helmet</b> mounted display, the Integrated <b>Helmet</b> and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their <b>helmet,</b> making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{off-road}} <b>helmets</b> did {{not include}} a chin bar, with riders using <b>helmets</b> very similar to modern open face street <b>helmets,</b> and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth. Modern off-road <b>helmets</b> include a (typically angular, rather than round) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris. When properly combined with goggles, the result provides most of the same protective features of full face street <b>helmets.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{civilian}} life, <b>helmets</b> {{are used}} for recreational activities and sports (e.g. jockeys in horse racing, American football, ice hockey, cricket, baseball, camogie, hurling and rock climbing); dangerous work activities (e.g. construction, mining, riot police); and transportation (e.g. motorcycle <b>helmets</b> and bicycle <b>helmets).</b> Since the 1990s, most <b>helmets</b> are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids.|$|R
5|$|Schumacher, in {{conjunction}} with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon <b>helmet.</b> In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact. The <b>helmet</b> keeps the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, Prost used {{variants}} of his <b>helmet</b> design, in 2007 {{he used his}} original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white <b>helmet</b> with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe trepassing the visor, designed by kaos design.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a <b>helmet.</b> The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as {{the inspiration for the}} university's vision. The chief of the shield bears an open book, a common symbol of learning, with a maple leaf on each side, signifying that McMaster's charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. The <b>helmet,</b> above the shield, has the open visor and forward-facing style typically used by universities. The mantling surrounding the shield and <b>helmet</b> represents the cloak worn over a knight's armour as protection from the sun. The crest, located above the <b>helmet,</b> is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian Senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias. The motto is located above the crest, as is common in Scottish heraldry.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>helmets</b> in skiing {{was rare}} until about 2000, but by about 2010 a {{majority}} of skiers and snowboarders in the US and Europe wore <b>helmets.</b> <b>Helmets</b> are available in many styles, and typically consist of a hard plastic/resin shell with inner padding. Modern ski <b>helmets</b> may include many additional features such as vents, earmuffs, headphones, goggle mounts, and camera mounts.|$|R
