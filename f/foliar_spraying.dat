Rate of fertilizer on unsaturated fatty acids content of oil had effect, in which the greatest amount of mono band fatty acid of oleic acid (18 : 1) (15. 92 %) were gets without using of micronutrients or <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> of at least of micronutrients fertilizer., also the highest amount (75. 97 %) of diband fatty acid of linoleic acid (18 : 2) with using 4. 5 kg. ha- 1 of micronutrients, and the most of multiple band fatty acid (0. 29 %) of linolenic acid (18 : 3) was obtained with consuming 3 kg. ha- 1 of micronutrients fertilizer. Interaction effect of micronutrients fertilizer and time application of fertilizer on unsaturated fatty acids content of oil, such as linoleic (18 : 2) and linolenic (18 : 3) were significant (P≤ 0. 01). In which, the highest amount of linoleic acid (18 : 2) obtained in <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> of 4. 5 kg. ha- 1 micronutrients during 3 weeks after silique formation, and the greatest quantity of linolenic acid (18 : 3) achieved by <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> of 2. 5 kg ha- 1 micronutrients during 4 weeks after siliqe formation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study effects of humic acid <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> and {{nitrogen}} fertilizer management on yield and yield components of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). An experiment in factorial format based on randomized complete block design with three replications, during 2011 year in Astaneh Ashrafiyeh (north of Iran) was conducted. Factors of experiment includes {{two levels of}} foliar humic acid spraying (H 1 : 0 (control) and H 2 : 40 mg/l) and four levels of nitrogen fertilizer levels consist of (n 1 : 0 (control), n 2 : 25 kg/ha, n 3 : 50 kg/ha, n 4 : 75 kg/ha pure nitrogen from source of urea). In maturity time, seed yield, straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were measured. Effects of humic acid <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> and nitrogen management on all traits were significant at 1 % probability level. Interaction effect of humic acid and nitrogen management on seed yield, straw yield and harvest index showed significant differences at 5 % probability level. Also, on biological yield was non significant. With attention to results of experiment, with increase nitrogen application up to 75 kg/ha all studied traits were increased. In all measured traits, the treatment of 40 mg/l humic acid <b>foliar</b> <b>spraying</b> was superior...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of seed treatment and <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> with fungicides in controlling black point incidence of wheat seeds was evaluated in the field. Two seed treating fungicides, namely Vitavax- 200 and Homai- 80 WP were used @ 0. 25 % of dry seed weight and <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> with Tilt- 250 EC (0. 05 %) was applied in six different schedules. Untreated and unsprayed controls were also maintained. Seed treatment with either Vitavax- 200 or Homai- 80 WP significantly increased plant population and grain yield, {{but none of}} them was found effective in reducing black point incidence. On the other hand, <b>foliar</b> <b>sprays</b> with Tilt- 250 EC under all the spray schedules except spraying at 70 and 90 DAS significantly minimized the disease severity over unsprayed control.

40|$|A commercially {{developed}} aqueous Chitosan formulation Elexa {{was used}} in different concentrations viz., 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 15, 1 : 19 and 1 : 25 as seed soaking treatment to pearl millet for 3, 6 and 9 h duration to test for its effect on germination and vigor index. Among the treatments used 1 : 19 for 6 h soaking recorded maximum germination and seedling vigor. Seed treatment, <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> and combination of seed treatment and <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> were tested for control of downy mildew disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola in pearl millet under greenhouse and field conditions. Metalaxyl {{at the rate of}} 2. 1 % a. i. in the form of Apron 35 SD seed treatment was used as check. Under greenhouse conditions seed treatment offered 48 % protection. <b>Foliar</b> <b>spray</b> was carried out to two, seven and 14 -day-old seedlings and there was marked reduction in downy mildew disease incidence. Maximum protection of 67 % was recorded with <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> to 2 -day-old seedlings. With the combination of seed treatment and <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> to 2 -day-old seedlings offered 71 % protection. Under field conditions Elexa treatments were evaluated for their effect on incidence and severity of downy mildew disease. Seed treatment reduced downy mildew severity to 42. 5 % and recorded 38 % protection, whereas <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> to 7 -day-old seedlings gave 67 % protection and reduced severity to 25 %. Combination of seed treatment and <b>foliar</b> <b>spray</b> to 7 -day-old seedlings recorded 69 % protection and reduced severity by 23 %. The nature of disease control mechanisms has been investigated and the results indicated that it is due to induction of systemic resistance. The induction of resistance was observed as early as 24 h time gap between the inducer treatment and pathogen inoculation and the maximum resistance developed at 24 - 48 h time gap and maintained thereafter. Elexa treated to pearl millet seeds offered growth promoting effect under greenhouse conditions and recorded increase in plant height, earhead length and seed weight. Hence, it is inferred that Elexa is a good downy mildew disease management commercial formulation and also exhibits growth-promoting effects in pearl millet. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>foliar</b> <b>sprays</b> of zinc and {{manganese}} sulfates on {{the fruit}} yield and quality {{as well as}} leaf nutrients concentration of pomegranate were studied during 2010 growing season in an orchard with a soil pH of 7. 5 and EC of 5. 2 (dS m- 1). Zinc and manganese sulfates were applied two times {{at the rate of}} 0, 0. 3 and 0. 6 percent under a factorial design on the base of completely randomized blocks. Mn sprays had positive significant effects on the fruit yield, the aril/peel ratio, TSS, weight of 100 arils. juice content of arils, anthocyanin index, fruit diameter and leaf area. Zn effects were also significant for TSS, TSS/TA ratio, juice content of arils and leaf area. <b>Foliar</b> <b>spray</b> of Mn significantly increased Mn and N but decreased Zn and Cu concentrations in leaves. <b>Foliar</b> <b>sprays</b> of Zn significantly increased Zn but decreased Mn and P concentrations in the leaves.
