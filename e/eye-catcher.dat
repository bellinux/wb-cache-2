30|$|Moreover, {{maps are}} {{commensurate}} {{with the demands of}} internet communication and traditional broadcasting media: both ask for visualizations and a simple “language,” and they both promote a visual trend that is also evidenced, for example, in the growing number of pictorial representations in online communication (for example, icons). In media theory and practice, the reduction of reality by numbers and statistics is an important and common method to gain attention (Luhmann 1990). Maps are ideal visual support for a controversial presentation: they combine a commonly accepted statistical relevance with the advantage of being <b>eye-catchers.</b> In this way, maps are not only relevant for academia and politics, but also for the constitution of the public sphere and public opinion, and it can be expected that the importance of maps will grow in the next media-dominated decades.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>eye-catchers</b> {{that can}} be found in formal gardens are {{ornamental}} structural elements, such as beds that are arranged to form intertwined patterns, or beds with complex geometrical arrangements of the plants. However, formal gardens that contain these elements lose their simplistic design in part and are no longer easy to care for. Most of the plants in a formal garden need pruning only once a year. This occasion is mostly used for topiary. Topiary is a practice where evergreen woody plants, for example box trees, yew trees, hollies or pine trees are cut into geometric shapes, such as spheres, pyramids, or cones but also into animal shapes or other more fanciful shapes. In larger formal gardens, usually there are hedge mazes, which are constructed by means of topiary. These mazes include archways, hidden resting places and cul-de-sacs.|$|R

Number of pages: 73 (79 including enclosures) Author: Sara Andréasson Tutor: Anne-Marie Morhed Course: Media and Communication Studies D (2 IV 091) Period: VT 2013 University: Division of Media and Communication, Department of Informatics and Media, Uppsala University. Purpose/ Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the {{representation of}} gender in advertising that has both men and women as the primary audience. The aim of the study was to investigate how Gucci has chosen to represent men and women in their advertising campaigns 2003 and 2013. Material/ Method: A semiotic analysis was performed by using three images from Gucci's spring/ summer campaign for Tom Ford in 2003, and three images from Gucci's spring/ summer campaign for Frida Giannini in 2013. Main result: The results showed that there was a clear difference between Ford and Gianninis ways of representing women and men in the two advertising campaigns. The women in Fords campaign 2003 are presented as sexual objects and represented by the male pornographic imagination and portrayed as sexual <b>eye-catchers</b> while the men are portrayed as addicted to sex. Frida Gianninis advertising images is a contrast of Ford pornographic portrayal of women. Giannini presents women as confident individuals while the man is represented as feminized and androgynous in his appearance. ...|$|R

One of the <b>eye-catchers</b> of Dubailand {{will be the}} Great Dubai Wheel, a {{multifunctional}} Ferris wheel with a diameter of 185 meters. In contrast with the existing Ferris Wheels this wheel {{does not have any}} spokes. Furthermore, being supported by the entrance building, the wheel will be used not only as an observation wheel, but also as a slowly rotating hotel. Research: Removing the spokes will have great influence on the structural behavior. To understand the structural behavior of this centre less Ferris wheel the structure and loads of the current design, were modeled and analyzed using the finite element program SCIA ESA PT. Using this model the strength, stiffness and stability of the basic design were analyzed. The feasibility was checked using the Dutch NEN code. Conclusion: By leaving out the spokes the structural behavior of the wheel will change considerably. Where the stiffness and the global stability of the structure are sufficient, the strength of the current structure will be insufficient. The distribution of the forces shows a peak above the highest support. The peak, which is caused by the restriction of the deformation by the support construction, will have a negative influence on the static and the fatigue strength of the wheel. To create a feasible structure the peak should be reduced by adjusting the design of the Wheel, the support structure, or both. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

In England they call table beautifully executed pieces often conversation pieces, but the Dutch word eyecatcher, which is used less frequently, is a valuable equivalent. Also Objets de vertu: small items of often costly materials are <b>eye-catchers.</b> They are meant to lure the gaze caught and to keep the attention fixed. Clean objects collected in the drawer, are as contemporary de vertu Objets be considered. They are not all made ​​of precious materials as a synthetic material, tin, beads or winning a mineral to valuable by the sophisticated operation of the artist who created it. The archive of clean objects shows how the goldsmith from craftsman to jewelery artist or -vormgever has evolved. Precious metals are only occasionally used, but if they are used is not for nothing: they must capture our gaze and attention and hold it, whether they are the supporting structure of a piece.

The prints, drawings, printings, and posters have different functions: it can be an illustration, or an independent work, sometimes it is a sketch that served as inspiration.

50|$|In the 1780s {{there was}} another style {{evolving}} which sometimes {{is referred to as}} a 'Folly Gothic', houses which were intended as <b>eye-catchers.</b> Possibly the best example of this is Clytha Castle the work of architect and garden designer John Davenport. This style was a less archaeologically correct form of Gothic revival and was widely used in Wales during the period 1780 to about 1810. Greater emphasis was placed on prominent arrow slits in round towers, blanked quatrefoil windows and stepped and angled battlements on gables. The earliest example of this may be the re-building of Penrhyn Castle, sometime before 1782 by Samuel Wyatt for Richard Pennant, who was to develop the Bethesda slate quarries. This building is only known from drawings by Moses Griffiths, though parts of it were incorporated into Thomas Hopper's rebuilding of Penrhyn. While it shows the features of this evolving style, the doorway shows the influence of Strawberry Hill gothic.Folly Gothic was a style which was widely adopted for park gates and lodges and for small houses sited in picturesque positions in locations frequented by tourists.A good example is Ogwen Bank near Bethesda, built by Lord Penhryn, possibly to a design by Samuel Wyatt, for visitors to the Ogwen falls. In the Montgomeryshire at Berriew Bodheilin was built was built in a prominent position overlooking the valley of the river Severn. This was burnt down in 1906, but an engraving shows a fantastic villa with five towers fronted with a Neoclassical portico.In Wales pointed Gothic windows continued to be widely used until about 1810. In Montgomeryshire iron framed Gothic windows were used to embellish vernacular houses. Grander houses such as Dol-Llys in Llanidloes, built for George Mears around 1800, by an unknown architect, but in the villa style of John Nash, had wooden Gothic windows.One of the most eye-catching gothic follies in Wales is Paxton's Tower. Built by Sir William Paxton (1745-1824), Paxton made his first fortune while with the HEIC in Calcutta with Charles Cockerell, brother of the architect. He purchased the Middleton Hall estate about 1790 and built this tower 1808. Designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell who also worked for Paxton in the development of Tenby. The tower was built to commemorate Nelson's death at Trafalgar. The tower is 36 feet high. The lower part of the tower is triangular in shape with a turret at each corner and on the first floor there is a banqueting room. On the second floor there is a hexagonal prospect room surrounded by roof terraces.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis „Construction Of A Women In The Illustrations Of Anne“ seeks {{an answer}} to a question, how is an average image of woman {{constructed}} through the illustrations in the women’s magazine. Theoretical chapter draws mainly on the works of Joke Hermes, Anna Gough-Yates, Barbi Pilvre, Peeter Linnap and Jean Baudrillard and concludes that modern beauty industry has created a myth about being beautiful: women’s magazines rely on it and by promoting this, they assure their profits. Because modern women have little time, they don’t have time to read magazines −they rather dip into it for short time seeking for relaxation, mainly looking at the main <b>eye-catchers,</b> including pictures. And that {{is the main reason}} why illustrations are being researched. Empirical material contains six magazines from year 2006. Analysis bases on all the pictures that were used to illustrate non-commercial articles. Because 83 of the photos were small pictures of an author or commentator, they were analyzed separately from the rest − 468 illustrations (containing drawings, photos from private collection, from agencies and by photographers working for magazine). A coding table was created and visual content analysis conducted. The hypotheses set in the thesis were answered as follows: 1. The main similarity between all the pictures is that most of women in illustrations follow beauty standards. But different subtopics present women differently: topics creating western beauty myths (Beauty, Fashion, Sex etc) use mainly model pictures from agencies. Topics talking about living with standard that are imposed to womanhood show the „real“ women (and it is mainly in these pictures, where you can find photos that in some elements do not correspond to western beauty standards). 2. Hypothesis that women in pictures are mainly alone and not doing anything is unsupported by evidence. 3. Unsupported by evidence is also hypothesis, that there is more constructed women (models, drawings) in the illustrations than „real“ women. The findings show their presence almost equal: 52 % of „real“ women and 48 % of the rest. 4. Hypothesis, that there are only 5 % of women looking recognizably overweight, found assurance. On a tangential note, only 14 % of total pictures women can be classified not to follow beauty standards. 5. Main amount of model pictures were used on beauty, sex and fashion pages. Private collection pictures were mainly used in travel and portrait stories; drawings in horoscope, fashion and psychology topics. 6. Average woman, who you can see in the pictures of the magazine, correspond better to the verbal description of a reader than a visual one, because later represents example of constructed beauty, what is designed according to western beauty standards and is ment to be hard to reach...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate {{thesis is}} written at the multi-disciplinary {{research}} school Identity and Pluralism−and also within {{the subject of}} Church History−at the Department of Culture and Communication, University of Linkoping, Sweden. In the thesis {{the rise of the}} Cell Group Church is explained. Further the Cell Group Church is analyzed with help of questions regarding identity and pluralism. The author conceives a basis of identity, an approach to define cell-structured churches. This basis can in turn constitute a premise for continued research. Furthermore adequate criteria to evaluate the movement are put forth. The dissertation poses three main questions. How was the Cell Group Church formed? Is it possible to identify the Cell Group Church with help of identity markers? What criteria are appropriate to use for an evaluation of the Cell Group Church? The concept of the Cell Group Church was coined by Dr. Ralph W. Neighbour and it is he and his book ‘Where Do We Go From Here?’ which are the <b>eye-catchers</b> in this thesis. In what way might Neighbour’s own personal development have affected the design? The intention is not to make a psychological study of Neighbour’s persona, but to weigh in some decisive events that are found in Neighbour’s own biography and that might have affected the design of the Cell Group Church. But influence also has occurred from the outside. What has happened when the Cell Group Church has met the congregations of reality in Korea, Singapore, The Ivory Coast and Columbia? What has Neighbour modified and what in the Cell Group Church has endured? Within the given frame, 1965 - 2006, there has been an interaction going on between Neighbour and his personal development on the one side and his encounters with reality on the other. In this tension a process of reform is growing. The author will highlight what is lasting in this process, what stands for continuity, and what means a change of identity. The method is to begin with historically descriptive but devolves into being analytical. This thesis contributes to the basic research in the field of the Cell Group Church. The movement of the Cell Church is a part of a forceful global course of events within Christianity. There are historians of religion and sociologists of religion who mean that a new kind of Christianity is forming in our times. The manner in which the Cell Group Church relates to its contemporary period is interesting both from international as well as Swedish conditions. Is the Cell Group Church an alternative that will replace the churches of old? Can the Cell Group Church contribute to the survival of the churches of old...|$|R
