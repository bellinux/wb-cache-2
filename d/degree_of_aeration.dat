At low drop heights, triangular broad-crested weir had the higher values of the air entrainment rate than the other weir types tested and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the angle in triangular broad-crested weir was decreased.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented into how negative system pressures, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration,</b> and gutter water levels {{are affected by}} the number of outlets in a siphonic roof drainage system. The experimental results show that system pressures decrease if outlets are blocked. It is also shown that the depth of water above an outlet is strongly influenced by the negative pressure acting at the outlet. As the suction effect at the outlet increases, due to lower system pressures, more water and air will be drawn into the outlets and this will result in a corresponding increase in overall gutter water depth. The results also show that there is often built-in redundancy in multiple outlet siphonic systems experiencing lower-intensity rainfall events, and if one or two outlets were blocked, the system would still operate satisfactorily. A new outlet suppressor was trialled and this was shown to reduce gutter water levels by up to 58 % at some positions in the gutter. ...|$|E

30|$|The reaeration of lung with PEEP {{would be}} {{expected}} to rebalance regional ventilation, reduce lung density, and eliminate the enhanced transmission at the chest wall boundary and thus eventually restore baseline power spectra. While this occurred gradually with incremental increase in PEEP, the spectral changes were essentially complete with only 10 cmH 2 O. Increasing the PEEP to 15 cmH 2 O did not further change the power spectra or respiratory system compliance despite improving oxygenation. It is possible that the power spectral changes depend on relatively large changes in aeration, which in our subjects was mostly complete at PEEP of 10 cmH 2 O. More modest recovery in the ventilation perfusion ratio may still continue to improve oxygenation at higher PEEP levels. A good correlation between change in spectral power and venous admixture is further proof that these variables both reflect the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>aeration</b> during injury and recruitment (Figure  5). Hyperinflation-induced attenuation of spectral power would not be expected in injured lungs at 15 cmH 2 O of PEEP because even in normal lungs PEEP levels of 10 cmH 2 O or higher are required to produce this effect [9].|$|R

Other effects, such as reflection and dynamic amplification also indicated that the pulses constituted waves propagating through an elastic 2 -phase medium consisting of water and a small amount of air. Based on these observations, concepts for a numerical model of pressure pulse propagation in water were developed and implemented.

The hydrogenase enzymes comprising these systems have different electrophoretic mobilities and produce a band pattern that is unique for each bacterial species. Of 20 bacterial species known to possess hydrogenase activity and which were examined by this technique, only the activities of Clostridium tetanomorphum and C. thermosaccharolyticum could be attributed, at pH 8. 3, to a single hydrogenase enzyme. This multiplicity of hydrogenase forms was found both in bacteria which contain mostly soluble hydrogenases and in those where the hydrogenase is predominantly associated with particulate material. When solubilization of this particulate material could be effected, at least two solubilized hydrogenases were released, and, of these, one {{would have the same}} electrophoretic properties (i. e., RF) as one of the soluble hydrogenases already present in small amounts within the cell.

In the natural environment, the sourdough bacteria, tentatively identified as lactobacilli, coexist with a yeast, Saccharomyces exiguus, and this study was undertaken to determine whether this yeast or flour ingredients including glucose or other factors were involved in this variable production of acetic acid. The proportion of acetic acid produced in broth culture on maltose, the preferred carbohydrate source, was found to depend almost entirely on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration.</b> Essentially anaerobic conditions, as obtained by thorough evacuation and flushing with CO 2 or N 2, resulted in very low (5 % or less) proportions of acetic acid. Aerobic conditions, achieved by continuous shaking in cotton-plugged flasks, yielded high levels (23 to 39 % of the total) of acetic acid. Similar effects of aeration were observed with glucose as the substrate, although growth was considerably slower, or in nonsterile flour suspension systems. It is theorized that, under aerobic conditions, the reduced pyridine nucleotides generated in the dissimilation of carbohydrate are oxidized directly by molecular oxygen, thereby becoming unavailable for the reduction of the acetyl phosphate intermediate to ethyl alcohol, the usual product of anaerobic dissimilation of glucose by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Comparative studies with known strains of homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli showed similar effects of aeration only on the heterofermentative strains, lending additional support to the tentative grouping by previous workers from this laboratory of the sourdough bacteria with the heterofermentative lactobacilli...|$|E
40|$|The role of fat {{crystals}} in the stabilisation of {{air bubbles}} in cake batters was studied with aqueous phase aerations {{prepared by the}} 2 ̆ 2 all in one 2 ̆ 2 method using shortening containing emulsifier. During mixing, fat crystals become coated with an interfacial layer of ad sorbed protein (crystal -water interface). They adsorb {{to the surface of}} bubbles (that have been transiently stabilised by egg proteins) by a process which involves the fu sion of the crystal-water interface with the air-water interface. The adsorption of fa t crystals helps to stabilise large numbers of small bubbles which must expand without rupturing during baking if the batter is not to col lapse. During heating, the fat crystals melt, the oil runs over the internal surface of the bubble and leaves behind the crystal-water interface which can be used by the bubble to provide extra interface during its expansion. Implicit in this mechanism is the explanation for: a) how fat moves from the aqueous phase to the inside surface of air bubbles during coo king; b) why oil does not produce the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> cake <b>aeration</b> as the same weight of crystalline fat; and c) the fact that shortenings containing crystals of the B-polymorph perform better than those containing the larger B-polymorph. A similar mechanism may operate in other aerated cereal products, such as bread, in which crystalline fat is known to produce similar improvements in volume and crumb structure...|$|R
