5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|Although Suzuki might {{indeed have}} seen peace as a distant goal, {{he had no}} design to achieve it within any {{immediate}} time span or on terms acceptable to the Allies. His own comments at the conference of senior statesmen gave no <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> he favored any early cessation of the war...Suzuki's selections for the most critical cabinet posts were, with one exception, not advocates of peace either.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} before their departure, Wolfgang {{composed}} prolifically, gaining the favour of Archbishop Siegmund Christoph von Schrattenbach, who, as Leopold's employer, had to consent to the journey. Permission to travel, along with a gift of 600florins, was granted in October. Wolfgang was awarded the honorary title of Konzertmeister (court musician), with a <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> on his return this post would merit a salary.|$|E

As well, Beverly strongly <b>hints</b> <b>that</b> Peter and Felicity will be married.|$|R
50|$|Archipelepidiforms are {{regarded}} as the basalmost thelodonts primarily because the histology and morphology of archipelepidiforms have many similarities with the histology and morphology of pteraspidomorphs, <b>hinting</b> <b>that</b> the two groups share a common ancestor, and <b>hinting</b> <b>that</b> archipelepidiforms retain many primitive features from this common ancestor.|$|R
5|$|Inaction chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} {{for a return to}} combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E
5|$|On Growth and Form {{explained}} in detail why he believed Darwinism {{to be an}} inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form. Instead, he advocated structuralism {{as an alternative to}} natural selection in governing the form of species, with a <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> vitalism was the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaur tooth marks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions. Tooth wear patterns <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> complex head shaking behaviors {{may have been involved}} in tyrannosaur feeding.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} or left unfinished is disputed among experts. The egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann {{believes that the}} pyramid was indeed finished, but others, such as Miroslav Verner, think that the building was left unfinished because of the pharaoh's premature death. In particular, no traces of outer cladding were found, which could <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> there never was one because the pyramid was not completed.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.|$|E

5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> reality is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in fact, Brezhnev portrayed {{himself as}} a moderate— not as radical as Kosygin but not as {{conservative}} as Shelepin. Brezhnev gave the Central Committee formal permission to initiate Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. According to historian Robert Service, Brezhnev did modify some of Kosygin's reform proposals, {{many of which were}} unhelpful at best. In his early days, Brezhnev asked for advice from provincial party secretaries, and spent hours each day on such conversations. During the March 1965 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev took control of Soviet agriculture, another <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> he opposed Kosygin's reform program. Brezhnev believed, in contrast to Khrushchev, that rather than wholesale re-organization, the key to increasing agricultural output was making the existing system work more efficiently.|$|E

5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
5|$|Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pitești {{had become}} a veritable agent of influence. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pitești who {{actually}} dropped a <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> his support for Germany was a lucrative employment. Through various notes in scattered diaries, most {{of which have been}} lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pitești taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign propaganda effort. Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pitești was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains doubtful. It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, and never returned, some 10,000 lei, siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pitești.|$|E
5|$|The American Samoa {{team were}} troubled by {{passport}} issues, {{with only one}} member of their original 20-man senior team, goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, eligible to play. Some <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> the passport issue was an Australian ploy to win the match by a large margin {{in order to secure}} the team's move to the AFC. American Samoa were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time. They were forced to draft in their youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager and Football Federation American Samoa vice-president Tony Langkilde, some of the Samoan players had never played a full 90-minute game before the match with Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 {{was an unusual}} comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian Order {{used this}} period to {{consolidate}} their control over Samogitian lands. They built three castles along the border: Memelburg (Klaipėda), Georgenburg (Jurbarkas), and Doben (Durbe in Latvia). The Samogitians responded by electing Algminas as their war leader, and attacked Courland, as the Order had limited battlefield successes. In 1259, the Livonian Order lost the Battle of Skuodas, and in 1260, it lost the Battle of Durbe. The first loss encouraged a rebellion by the Semigalians, and the later loss spurred the Prussians into an uprising against the Order. The Great Prussian Uprising lasted for 14 years. Encouraged by Treniota, his nephew, Mindaugas broke {{peace with the}} Order. Some chronicles <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> he also returned to his former pagan beliefs, but this is disputable. Nevertheless, all the diplomatic achievements made since his coronation were lost.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes <b>hint</b> <b>that</b> he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
