500|$|Despite the {{acceptance}} of the Bacon cover by Doubleday, Dystel did not like the cover, and assigned New York illustrator Roger Kastel to do a different one for the paperback.

In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E

Paste magazine's Jeffrey Bloomer likened the episode simply to pulp and felt that Dexter's voice overs lacked their usual [...] "dry, dark humor and gonzo wisdom". IGN critic Matt Fowler believed that Dexter and Miguel's conversations contained [...] "traces of overly awkward dialogue all over" [...] and that the pairings of Debra and Quinn, and LaGuerta and Ellen were [...] "forced" [...] while Miguel's desire to kill seemed [...] "unnatural". Writing for TV Guide, Paula Paige said that her <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode was Dexter's spinning Fleeter on the table like a roulette wheel and also she enjoyed Rita's storyline, calling her a [...] "hormonal hoot".

500|$|For {{the screen}} adaptation, Spielberg {{wanted to stay}} with the novel's basic plot, while omitting Benchley's many subplots. He {{declared}} that his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book was the shark hunt on the last 120pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, [...] "I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third." [...] When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer's Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, [...] "I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do." [...] Benchley would later describe his contribution to the finished film as [...] "the storyline and the ocean stuff – basically, the mechanics", given he [...] "didn't know how to put the character texture into a screenplay." [...] One of his changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca. During the film's production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.|$|E
500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so we asked) how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E
500|$|Written in 1986, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was {{the first}} song lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken wrote for The Little Mermaid, although Menken {{had not yet been}} enlisted as Ashman's composer when the song was first conceived. Directly inspired by Broadway's most successful musicals, Ashman believed that The Little Mermaids story would benefit from at least one song that serves as its heroine's [...] "inner diary of thoughts". Having always intended for Ariel to perform a song in her grotto, directors and screenwriters Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song in which Ariel declares her love for Prince Eric by singing to a statue of the character, but Ashman suggested that a song depicting the character's fascination with the human world would be a stronger alternative. Ashman explained to the filmmakers that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] would be Ariel's [...] "I Want" [...] song, likening it to moments in stage musicals during which the heroine sings about her dreams so that the audience can begin to care about the character and her journey. Menken believes that Disney had not yet included explicit [...] "I Want" [...] songs in the studio's films prior to The Little Mermaid, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] the first time one had been written intentionally for a Disney film. However, Disney princesses had technically been singing [...] "I Want" [...] songs since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950). Observing structural similarities between the song and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from their musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982), the songwriters nicknamed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] "Somewhere That's Dry" [...] because they believe it resembles an [...] "underwater version" [...] of the Little Shop of Horrors song. Additionally, Ashman had written a song entitled [...] "Disneyland" [...] with composer Marvin Hamlisch for their Broadway musical Smile (1986) in which a young girl, much like Ariel, sings about regularly watching Disney anthology series as a means of escaping her troubled childhood. Menken identified the musical motif he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. Ashman debuted [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals. Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human world itself as he [...] "became Ariel before our eyes" [...] and [...] "poured out his heart in song", helping them visualize [...] "this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.” ...|$|E
