40|$|Abstract — The {{notion of}} <b>exact</b> bisimulation <b>equivalence</b> for nondeterministic {{discrete}} systems has recently resulted in notions of <b>exact</b> bisimulation <b>equivalence</b> for continuous and hybrid systems. In this paper, we establish the more robust notion of approximate bisimulation equivalence for nondeterministic nonlinear systems. This {{is achieved by}} requiring that a distance between system observations starts and remains, close, {{in the presence of}} nondeterministic system evolution. We show that approximate bisimulation relations can be characterized using a class of functions called bisimulation functions. For nondeterministic nonlinear systems, we show that conditions for the existence of bisimulation functions can be expressed in terms of Lyapunov-like inequalities, which for deterministic systems can be computed using recent sum-of-squares techniques. Our framework is illustrated on a safety verification example. I...|$|R

Homological systems generalize, on one hand, the notion of stratifying systems in module categories, {{and on the other}} hand, the notion of exceptional sequences in triangulated categories. We prove that, attached to the homological system Θ, there are two standardly stratified algebras A and B, which are derived equivalent. Furthermore, it is proved that the category (Θ), of the Θ-filtered objects in a triangulated category, admits in a very natural way an structure of an exact category, and then there are <b>exact</b> <b>equivalences</b> between the <b>exact</b> category (Θ) and the exact categories of the Δ-good modules associated to the standardly stratified algebras A and B. Some of the obtained results can be seen also under the light of the cotorsion pairs in the sense of Iyama-Nakaoka-Yoshino (see and ).

40|$|A {{critical}} dilute O(n) {{model on}} the kagome lattice is investigated analytically and numerically. We employ {{a number of}} <b>exact</b> <b>equivalences</b> which, in a few steps, link the critical O(n) spin model on the kagome lattice to the exactly solvable critical q-state Potts model on the honeycomb lattice with q=(n+ 1) ^ 2. The intermediate steps involve the random-cluster model on the honeycomb lattice, and a fully packed loop model with loop weight n'=√(q) and a dilute loop model with loop weight n, both on the kagome lattice. This mapping enables the determination of a branch of critical points of the dilute O(n) model, {{as well as some}} of its critical properties. For n= 0, this model reproduces the known universal properties of the θ point describing the collapse of a polymer. For n≠ 0 it displays a line of multicritical points, with the same universal properties as a branch of critical behavior that was found earlier in a dilute O(n) model on the square lattice. These findings are supported by a finite-size-scaling analysis in combination with transfer-matrix calculations. Comment: 19 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{increasing}} {{trend toward}} product {{development in a}} collaborative environment {{has resulted in the}} use of various software tools to enhance the product design. This requires a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across different application domains. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to enable such semantic interoperability. A standards-based approach is used to develop a Product Semantic Representation Language (PSRL). Formal description logic (DAML + OIL) is used to encode the PSRL. Mathematical logic and corresponding reasoning is used to determine semantic equivalences between an application ontology and the PSRL. The semantic equivalence matrix enables resolution of ambiguities created due to differences in syntaxes and meanings associated with terminologies in different application domains. Successful semantic interoperability will form the basis of seamless communication and thereby enable better integration of product development systems. Note to Practitioners—Semantic interoperability of product information refers to automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data, among information resources throughout the product development. This research is motivated by the problems in enabling such semantic interoperability. First, product information is formalized into an explicit, extensible, and comprehensive product semantics representation language (PSRL). The PSRL is open and based on standard W 3 C constructs. Next, in order to enable semantic translation, the paper describes a procedure to semi-automatically determine mappings between exactly equivalent concepts across representations of the interacting applications. The paper demonstrates that this approach to translation is feasible, but it has not yet been implemented commercially. Current limitations and the directions for further research are discussed. Future research addresses the determination of semantic similarities (not <b>exact</b> <b>equivalences)</b> between the interacting information resources.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of models specified with formalisms like Markovian process algebras or stochastic automata can {{be based on}} equivalence relations among the states. In this paper we introduce a relation called <b>exact</b> <b>equivalence</b> that, differently from most aggegation approaches, induces an exact lumping on the underlying Markov chain instead of a strong lumping. We prove that this relation is a congruence for Markovian process algebras and stochastic automata whose synchronisation semantics {{can be seen as}} the master/slave synchronisation of the Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN). We show the usefulness of this relation by proving that the class of quasi-reversible models is closed under <b>exact</b> <b>equivalence.</b> Quasi-reversibility is a pivotal property to study product-form models, i. e., models whose equilibrium behaviour can be computed very efficiently without the problem of the state space explosion.
