40|$|Two {{possible}} {{interpretations of}} forced climate change {{view it as}} projecting, either linearly or nonlinearly, onto the <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> of variability of the climate system. An evaluation of these two interpretations is performed using annual mean sea level pressure (SLP) and surface air temperature (SAT) fields obtained from integrations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled general circulation model forced with varying concentrations of greenhouse gases. The <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> of SLP both represent much of the total variability and remain important in warmer climates. With SAT, however, the <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> are often related to variations in the sea-ice edge and so do not remain important once the ice has retreated; those unrelated to sea ice remain dominant in the warmer climates but represent smaller fractions of the total variability. In general, climate change tends to project most strongly onto the more <b>dominant</b> <b>modes.</b> The change in SLP projects partially onto the top two modes in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting both an overall decrease in hemispheric SLP {{as well as the}} pattern of change. In the Southern Hemisphere the change projects negligibly onto the dominant patterns between equilibrium climates but very strongly onto the Antarctic oscillation–like mode in the transient integrations. Changes in SAT project partially onto the <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> but relate more to the mean warming rather than the pattern of change. In general, the change projects most strongly onto the more <b>dominant</b> <b>modes.</b> In all SLP domains, the projection of climate change overwhelmingly manifests itself as a linear translation in the mode, consistent with the linear interpretation. In SAT domains related to sea-ice variability, the projection reflects an increased tendency toward ice-free regimes, consistent with the nonlinear perspective; however this nonlinear projection represents {{only a small portion of}} the overall climate change. 1...|$|R

With complex of requirements the selection of methods for real-time identification of LFOs? parameters is made. Necessity of using of power system stabilizers with settings adopted to the actual frequency values of LFOs? <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> for increasing of reliability of LFOs? damping in LFOs? integrated damping system is found out.

While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the <b>dominant</b> <b>mode</b> of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving.

For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E

It cannot track the <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> when the operating point of the system changes. To solve this problem, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was proposed in [12] to exploit the relationship between low-frequency oscillation features, and then the Morlet-based CWT of ringdown data was proposed to detect modal parameter changes and several guidelines were designed for selecting the center frequency, bandwidth parameters, scaling factor and the translation factor of CWT.|$|R
