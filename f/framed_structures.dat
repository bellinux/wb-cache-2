5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in <b>framed</b> <b>structures</b> to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> for {{spectrum}} sensing {{in a network}} of secondary users, and optimize the sum throughput of the network under the constraint on the aggregate interference offered by the network to the primary user. We contrast its performance with the traditional Stop And Sense (SAS) <b>frame</b> <b>structure,</b> which involves the secondary users stopping transmissions and sensing for spectrum holes. We obtain near-optimal, easily computable solutions for the sensing duration and sensing thresholds that approximately maximize the secondary throughput under an aggregate interference constraint. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we present a detailed comparison of the two schemes, and characterize the operating regimes where each <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is preferable over the other. In general when switching latencies are not accounted for, {{we find that the}} proposed Simultaneous Sense and Access (SSA) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> performs similar to the existing SAS <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in terms of throughput for all values of primary signal SNR. When switching latencies are accounted for, the SSA <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> offers significantly higher throughput gain for all values of primary SNR. Another advantage of this <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> over a few other existing <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> when employed in a network of secondary users {{is that it does not}} rely on the data in the previous slot to make decisions about the presence/absence of primary signal in the current slot which makes the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> ideal for an adhoc network...|$|R

30|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{behaviors of}} recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are investigated by numerical simulation method with 3 -D finite fiber elements. The dynamic characteristics and the seismic {{performance of the}} RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are analyzed and validated with the shaking table test results. Specifically, the natural frequency and the typical responses (e.g., storey deformation, capacity curve, etc.) from Model 1 (exclusion of strain rate effect) and Model 2 (inclusion of strain rate effect) are analyzed and compared. It is revealed that Model 2 {{is more likely to}} provide a better match between the numerical simulation and the shaking table test as key attributes of seismic behaviors of the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are captured by this model. For the purpose to examine how seismic behaviors of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> vary under different strain rates in a real seismic situation, a numerical simulation is performed by varying the strain rate. The storey displacement response and the base shear for the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under different strain rates are investigated and analyzed. It is implied that the structural behavior of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is significantly influenced by the strain rate effect. On one hand, the storey displacements vary slightly in the trend of decreasing with the increasing strain rate. On the other hand, the base shear of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under dynamic loading conditions increases with gradually increasing amplitude of the strain rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Frame</b> <b>{{structure}}</b> on a slope is {{a common}} kind of structure in a mountainous area. It can diminish the impact on environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the slope, using an opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in seismic design. Four sets of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> example on a slope sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly. The seismic responses characteristics of frames on a slope are studied in the paper from period, lateral deformation, seismic shear and so on, based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope. The main conclusions are as follows: the slope can enhance structural lateral stiffness to a certain extent; the opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, are not necessarily frail stories; the distribution of seismic force is uneven between the columns in the same floors which connect with the ground on different elevation level, and fixed columns undertake more than others, making them more fragile; the torsional effect is noticeable in the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope...|$|R
