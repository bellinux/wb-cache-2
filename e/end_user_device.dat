40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some {{challenges that}} user mobility imposes over the user-centric protection model against security threats. This model {{is based on}} the idea of offloading the security applications from the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>device,</b> and placing them in a trusted network node at the network's edge. Our research perspective is particularly centered around three interrelated mobility challenges, i) the allocation of the security applications “close” to the user, i. e., on network nodes with enhanced processing capabilities, ii) seamless mobility with negligible disruption of ongoing network connections, and iii) dynamic orchestration and management with support of security applications migration. Based on our arguments, we expose the main requirements and trade-offs to be considered in the attempt to support mobility in such environment. We propose a flexible solution that leverages Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization and Computing at the Network Edge to offer a seamless on-path security protection to mobile users. Our preliminary experiments' results considering a WiFi mobile user show that seamless security migration and mobility are feasible in a simple real scenario.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is based on the}} assumption that modern computer technologies are already potentially pervasive: CPUs are embedded in any sort of device; RAM and storage memory of a modern PDA is comparable to those of a ten years ago Unix workstation; Wi-Fi, GPRS, UMTS are leveraging the development of the wireless Internet. Nevertheless, computing is not pervasive because we do not have a clear conceptual model of the pervasive computer and we have not tools, methodologies, and middleware to write and to seamlessly deliver at once services over a multitude of heterogeneous devices and different delivery contexts. Our thesis addresses these issues starting from the analysis of forces in a pervasive computing environment: user mobility, user profile, user position, and device profile. The conceptual model, or metaphor, we use to drive our work is to consider the environment as surrounded by a multitude of services and objects and devices as the communicating gates between the real world and the virtual dimension of pervasive computing around us. Our thesis is thus built upon three main “pillars”. The first pillar is a domain-object-driven methodology which allows developer to abstract from low level details of the final delivery platform, and provides the user with the ability to access services in a multi-channel way. The rationale is that domain objects are self-contained pieces of software able to represent data and to compute functions and procedures. Our approach fills the gap between users and domain objects building an appropriate user interface which is both adapted to the domain object and to the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>device.</b> As example, we present how to design, implement and deliver an electronic mail application over various platforms. The second pillar of this thesis analyzes in more details the forces that make direct object manipulation inadequate in a pervasive context. These forces are the user profile, the device profile, the context of use, and the combinatorial explosion of domain objects. From the analysis of the electronic mail application presented as example, we notice that according to the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>device,</b> or according to particular circumstances during the access to the service (for instance if the user access the service by the interactive TV while he is having his breakfast) some functionalities are not compulsory and do not fit an adequate task sequence. So we decided to make task models explicit in the design of a service and to integrate the capability to automatically generate user interfaces for domain objects with the formal definition of task models adapted to the final delivery context. Finally, the third pillar of our thesis is about the lifecycle of services in a pervasive computing environment. Our solutions are based upon an existing framework, the Jini connection technology, and enrich this framework with new services and architectures for the deployment and discovery of services, for the user session management, and for the management of offline agents...|$|E
