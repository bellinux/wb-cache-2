40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was the roles of the general {{assembly}} agencies of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A., the Presbyterian Church in the U. S., and the United Presbyterian Church of North America in the development of Barber- Scotia College, Knoxville College, Johnson C. Smith University, Stillman College, and Mary Holmes College. The historical records of these three churches for the period from 1866 to 1983 were examined to analyze the factors surrounding the establishment of the five colleges, the differences and similarities in the administrative practices of the general assembly agencies charged with operating the colleges, the relationships of the colleges to the churches in the transition from <b>dependent</b> <b>mission</b> schools to independent colleges, and to identify way in which the Presbyterian Church (U. S. A.) may improve its support of Black higher education. The Presbyterian Churches established the mission schools to meet the religious, educational, and economical needs of the emancipated Black slaves. Though the three 2 churches had differences over the issues of slavery and doctrine, the administrative systems developed for the operations of the schools were very similar. All treated the missions schools as remedial temporary measures necessitated by the refusal of Southern and border states to provide adequately for the public education of Black people, and to satisfy the demand for educated Black clergy to attract Black members. From the period of 1866 to 1922, the churches laid the foundations for their educational and religious ministries to Black people by establishing over two-hundred schools. From 1923 to 1949, great reductions were made in the number of mission schools. During the period of 1950 to 1983, the Presbyterian Churches struggled with strategies to make the five remaining former mission schools independent of their administrative and financial support...|$|E

40|$|Thee {{unmanned}} planetary {{spacecraft to}} the outer planets have been controlled and operated successfully in space for an accumulated total of 66 years. The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft each have been in space for more than 26 years. The Galileo spacecraft was in space for 14 years, including eight years in orbit about Jupiter. During the flight operations for these missions, anomalies for the ground data system and the flight systems have been tracked using the anomaly reporting tool at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A total of 3300 incidents, surprises, and anomaly reports have been recorded in the database. This paper describes methods and results for classifying and identifying trends relative to ground system vs. flight system, software vs. hardware, and corrective actions. There are several lessons learned from these assessments that significantly benefit the design and planning for long life missions of the future. These include the necessity for having redundancy for successful operation of the spacecraft, awareness that anomaly reporting is <b>dependent</b> on <b>mission</b> activity not {{the age of the}} spacecraft, and the need for having a program to maintain and transfer operation knowledge and tools to replacement flight team members...|$|R

50|$|The {{flight pattern}} was {{programmed}} and {{allowed for the}} flight to the target areas, a run while the cameras or sensors recorded, and the return to the recovery site. On arrival at this calculated position, the motor cut and a drogue parachute was deployed. This slowed the drone down sufficiently to alter its attitude and allow a parachute {{to be released from}} the underside of the drone causing it to invert. Before reaching the ground a pair of pneumatic landing bags were released {{from the top of the}} drone (now facing the ground). The retrieval crew would then remove the cameras etc., and return the drone to be ready for its next flight.

2500|$|The {{interior}} of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal winch mounted within the forward cabin, {{which can be used}} to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on pallets into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted cargo hook, which would be usually rated at [...] for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at , this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be <b>dependent</b> upon <b>mission</b> specifics. For example, a search and rescue (SAR) variant would usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such operations.

Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|R
