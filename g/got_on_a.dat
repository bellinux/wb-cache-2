5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

When the police arrived the next morning, {{they were unable to}} find Mancini but found Kaye's body decomposing in the trunk in his new home. They {{immediately}} sent out a country-wide call for Mancini to be arrested, and he was picked up near London. He claimed he was not guilty, and stated during interviews with police that he had returned home to find Kaye dead. Fearing that with his criminal record, the police would not believe him, he had hidden the body in a trunk. While Mancini was in prison, his solicitor phoned Birkett and asked him to work as counsel for the defence, which Birkett agreed to do. In his defence, Birkett highlighted flaws in the prosecution's case to introduce an element of doubt {{in the minds of the}} jury. His cross-examination of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, famous Home Office pathologist and potentially the most dangerous witness for the Crown, was seen as [...] "masterly". [...] Birkett also emphasised the affectionate nature of the relationship between Kaye and Mancini before Kaye's death. Despite strong evidence that he had committed the crime, including marks on the victim's skull believed to be from a hammer and marks of blood on Mancini's clothing, the jury found Mancini innocent after two and a half hours of deliberations. Mancini later confessed to the murder before dying.|$|E

In addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat, Garfield is also pessimistic, narcissistic, sadistic, cynical, sarcastic, sardonic, negative and smug. He enjoys destroying things, mauling the mailman, tormenting Odie, and kicking Odie off the table; he also makes snide comments, usually about Jon's inability to get a date (in one strip, when Jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on New Year's Eve, Garfield replies, [...] "Don't feel bad Jon.

2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plane, and booked into the Saga hotel.

Sly and the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included Steven Tyler, John Legend, Van Hunt, Nile Rodgers and Robert Randolph. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a [...] "Sly" [...] beltbuckle and a silver lamé suit, he joined in on [...] "I Want To Take You Higher." [...] Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked {{to the front of the}} stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. [...] "He went up the ramp , <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle and took off," [...] Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the Chicago Sun-Times.

2500|$|In 1975, Schneemann {{performed}} Interior Scroll in East Hampton, New York {{and later}} that year, at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. This was a notable Fluxus-influenced piece featuring {{her use of}} text and body. [...] In her performance, Schneemann entered wrapped in a sheet, under which she wore an apron. [...] She disrobed and then <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> table where she outlined her body with dark paint. [...] Several times, she would take [...] "action poses", {{similar to those in}} figure drawing classes. [...] Concurrently, she read from her book Cézanne, She Was a Great Painter. [...] Following this, she dropped the book and slowly extracted from her vagina a scroll from which she read. Scheeman’s speech described a parody version of an encounter where she received criticism on her films for their “persistence of feelings” and “personal clutter”. Art Historian David Hopkins suggests that this performance was a comment on both “internalized criticism”, and possibly “feminist interest” in female writing. Schneemann's feminist scroll speech, according to performance theorist Jeanie Forte, made it seem as if [...] "'s vagina itself is reporting [...] sexism". [...] Art critic Robert C. Morgan states {{that it is necessary to}} acknowledge the period during which Interior Scroll was produced in order to understand it. [...] He argues that by placing the source of artistic creativity at the female genitals, Schneemann is changing the masculine overtones of minimalist art and conceptual art into a feminist exploration of her body. [...] Interior Scroll, along with Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, helped pioneer many of the ideas later popularized by the off-broadway show The Vagina Monologues.|$|E

2500|$|For The Veronicas, Jessica and Lisa {{wanted to}} create a [...] "progressive pop" [...] album drawing on {{inspiration}} from genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge, classical music, classical rock, pop and rap. Wanting to make an album which differed from their more familiar pop rock sound, Lisa said that this album would be [...] "eclectic" [...] and not [...] "predictable in any way." [...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I remember we really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. Eventually we came back around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would say exactly how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, we just put down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D... There’s more depth and there’s more thought, and more light and shade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the UDA women {{having found}} Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men {{present at the}} [...] "trial" [...] couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then [...] "rearrested" [...] her. It was alleged that this {{decision}} came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, [...] "Who does she think she is? The Queen?" [...] which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it {{pulled out of the}} station into the street, Douglas and her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed {{they were on their way}} to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that [...] "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area. [...] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.|$|E
