When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend named Nala, she confronts him, warning him of Scar's tyranny and begging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return home.

5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make an approach {{fast enough to}} escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E

5|$|Although Jennings {{dreamed of}} {{following}} in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, {{his first job}} was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada.

5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E

As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E
