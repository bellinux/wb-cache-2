On October 6, General Rockey accepted the surrender of 50,000 Japanese at Tientsin. Four days later, an additional 50,000 Japanese surrendered to <b>General</b> <b>Lien</b> Ching Sun, Chiang Kai Shek's personal representative in northern China. Most of the Japanese were concentrated in bivouacs and barracks near the coast; however, due to a shortage of man-power, the Japanese in many of their outlying positions were ordered to remain on guard duty until they could be relieved by Chinese Nationalists, or by the Marines.|$|E

[...] A special lien can be extended to a <b>general</b> <b>lien</b> by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers. [...] A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law, although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale, and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.|$|E

30|$|The {{first record}} of P. m. bivittatus on Kinmen {{can be traced}} back to the 1940 s, when <b>General</b> Hu <b>Lien,</b> the {{commander}} of the Kinmen armed forces between 1949 and 1958, described the snake-eating culture of his soldiers. In his book Memories of Kinmen (Hu 1976), pythons were reported to grow 4 to 6 m long, weigh 30 to 50 kg, and have a diameter at mid-body of over 35 cm. Interestingly, this statement was neglected by earlier herpetologists, who may have mistaken this description as an over-exaggeration of large Elaphe species. The custom in the army of eating pythons was thought to 'increase the power of the soldiers.’ Subsequently, over-harvesting of these huge snakes is thought to have caused a demographic explosion of rodent populations, which caused serious agricultural damage. Overpopulation by destructive rodents was out of control until <b>General</b> Hu <b>Lien</b> ordered his troops to stop killing pythons (Hu 1976). However, the constant bombardment during military engagements might have pushed the python population past the tipping point toward near extirpation. Between 1950 and 1960, only six pythons were recorded on the island. The last python recorded in the twentieth century was in 1967 (Kinmen Daily News, 16 May 1967).|$|R
50|$|During {{his stay}} in Hong Kong, Guan {{declined}} any political activities and {{spent most of}} his time in calligraphy and Chinese opera. Guan's relationship with General Chen Cheng was very rivalrous throughout their career, Guan maintained a close friendship with <b>General</b> Hu <b>Lien,</b> one of Chen Cheng's ablest subordinates. Guan also formed a closer relationship with his own former adjutant, General Liu Yuzhang when their children married each other. In April 1975 Guan travelled to Taiwan to show his last respect to Chiang Kai-shek's funeral. In 1980, General Guan Linzheng himself died at age 75. General Guan Linzheng and his wife are buried in Rosehills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. General Guan Linzheng is survived by two sons, four daughters, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.|$|R
40|$|The I. R. S. has an {{imposing}} armamentarium of {{means by which}} to collect unpaid taxes. They include the <b>general</b> tax <b>lien,</b> various special tax liens, administrative levy and sale, and judicial sale. There are many administrative and judicial protections for taxpayers and third parties against the overly zealous application {{of these and other}} devices. Nonetheless, the I. R. S. ’s collection options are of imposing breadth and power, considerably exceeding collection options available to private creditors. Confronted by these collection devices, those who owe taxes and are determined not to pay them sometimes resort to transferring their assets to others, typically family members, close associates, or controlled corporations or other entities. Part I of this article describes the three principal means by which the I. R. S. protects itself against or defeats such transfers. It also notes examples of the devices in Nevada and the interaction of state law and federal law as to them. Part II details an illustrative recent case applying law essential identical to Nevada law...|$|R
50|$|With the 7th army gone, east of Xuzhou {{was exposed}} to the PLA forces. The communist-placed secret agent persuaded Chiang to order the Suppression General Headquarters of Xuzhou Garrison to retreat to the South. Meanwhile, the Central Plains Field Army {{surrounded}} Lieutenant General Huang Wei's 12th Army which had arrived from Henan as reinforcement, only {{to be caught in}} a well-placed communist trap when they tried to retake Su Xian from the communists. General Liu Ruming's 8th army and Lieutenant General Li Yannian's 6th army tried to help their trapped ROC armies but were blocked by the PLA forces. After nearly a month of bloody seesaw battles, the PLA forces completely destroyed the 12th army, captured a number of much needed supplies, and conscripted prisoners of war to their ranks. Only Huang's deputy commander, Lieutenant <b>General</b> Hu <b>Lien,</b> riding in an armored tank, managed to penetrate the communist encirclement with 8,000 survivors but was badly wounded in the breakout. Chiang Kai-shek tried to save the 12th army and ordered the three armies still under the Suppression General Headquarters of Xuzhou Garrison to turn southeast and relieve the 12th army before it was too late on November 30, 1948. However, the PLA forces caught up with them (communist secret agents' intelligence) and they were encircled only 9 miles from Xuzhou.|$|R
