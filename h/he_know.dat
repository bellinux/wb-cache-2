At first an enemy, Gabriel goes on to become an ally to Vincent {{by the end of the}} first season and suggests he has found a cure to the virus inflicted on them by Muirfield.

25|$|Rather than {{ending with}} the {{conviction}} and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, {{the investigation into the}} break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so {{in a way that was}} least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.|$|E

Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew [...] "a bunch of cheap guys". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film.

500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
