40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>daminozide,</b> an inhibitor of gibberellins biosynthesis, on the somatic embryogenesis in immature and mature embryo derived from tissue cultures of wheat was investigated. Low concentrations of <b>daminozide</b> (0. 064 - 0. 127 mM) positively affected the somatic embryogenic capacity of immature embryos (cv. ‘Andros’) cultured on the medium supplemented with either 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) or dicamba or para chlorophenoxyacetic acid (p-CPA). The higher concentration of <b>daminozide</b> (0. 51 - 1. 02 mM) reduced the regeneration of shoots. The modification of exogenous/endogenous ratio of gibberellins by application of exogenous GA 3 did not remove {{the effect of}} <b>daminozide.</b> On the contrary, its combination with GA 3 inhibited the somatic embryogenesis and resulted in the supression {{of the development of}} somatic embryos. The supplement of 0. 127 mM <b>daminozide</b> to 2, 4 -D containing medium increased the embryogenic competence of immature embryos of 11 Russian spring and winter varieties. For ten varieties the number of shoots produced per callus did not differ statistically from the control medium; one variety showed the increase of shoot number. In contrast with immature wheat embryos, mature ones (cv. Tajoznaja) did not response to <b>daminozide</b> supplementation either of the inductive or the different- tiative media.

40|$|Influence of {{a single}} foliar {{application}} of growth regulators on the height and number of inflorescence shoots of the chrysanthemum cultivar ‚Revert ‘ was investigated during two growing seasons (2000, 2001). Two growth regulators were used, <b>daminozide</b> (Alar 85) and chlormequat (Cycocel). <b>Daminozide</b> was applied in concentrations of 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg l– 1 and a control (without treatment) while chlormequat was used in concentrations of 2000, 3000, 4000 mg l– 1 and a control (without treatment).

40|$|Steviol glycosides (SVglys) and {{gibberellins}} are {{originated from}} the shared biosynthesis pathway in Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni). In this research, two experiments {{were conducted to}} study the opposing effects of external gibberellin (GA 3) and <b>Daminozide</b> (a gibberellin inhibitor) on Stevia growth and metabolites. Results showed that GA 3 significantly increased the stem length and stem dry weight in Stevia. Total soluble sugar content increased while the SVglys biosynthesis was decreased by external GA 3 applying in Stevia leaves. In another experiment, the stem length was reduced by <b>Daminozide</b> spraying on Stevia shoots. The <b>Daminozide</b> {{did not affect the}} total SVglys content, while in 30 ppm concentration, significantly increased the soluble sugar production in Stevia leaves.

40|$|Eucomis autumnalis (Mill.) Chitt., {{commonly}} known as pineapple lily, is a new ornamental pot plant with great marketing potential. This work evaluated the effects of two gibberellin synthesis inhibitors (<b>daminozide</b> and flurprimidol) applied as commercial plant growth regulators (PGRs) B-Nine and Topflor on the growth, flowering, and bulb yield in E. autumnalis. The PGRs were applied three times as substrate drenches or foliar sprays at the concentration of 15 mg dm- 3 (flurprimidol) or 4250 mg dm- 3 (<b>daminozide).</b> Plant growth was restricted only by flurprimidol, particularly when it was applied as substrate drenches. Plant height was reduced by 48 % at anthesis and by 38 % at flower senescence, compared to the untreated control. Regardless of the application method, flurprimidol increased the leaf greenness index (SPAD) and bulb weight. <b>Daminozide</b> treatments were ineffective in controlling plant height and negatively influenced bulb weight.

In vitro propagated plants, grown in 12 cm pots were treated with single sprays of flurprimidol (7, 5, 15, 22, 5 mg l- 1) and <b>daminozide</b> (2500, 3500, 4500 mg 1 - 1) following second pruning, when shoots were 9 - 12 cm long. Well retarded plants of both dwarf alstroemeria cultivars were obtained when plants were sprayed with flurprimidol at 22. 5 mg 1 - 1. Plants treated with <b>daminozide</b> at all tested concentrations were to tall to be grown in 12 cm pots. Flurprimidol significantly reduced the canopy diameter, number of flowering shoots of alstroemeria cultivars 'Rosalina' and 'Dorotea' and floret size of cultivar 'Rosalina'. <b>Daminozide</b> had no effect on the number of days to flower but flurprimidol delayed flowering of tested cultivars only at concentration of 22. 5 mg 1 - 1.

Abscission of stages I and II coincided with a rapid increase in leaf area. Abscission of stage III coincided with the rapid increase in ovary growth. A localized dominance effect appeared to occur among buds located in close proximity. This became evident when multiple buds occurred at the same node or when numerous buds were borne on catkin peduncles. Both 'Ennis' and 'Barcelona' averaged over one nut cluster per node when multiple flower clusters were borne on a catkin peduncle. GA₃, 50 ppm, induced multiple budding at nodes. Developing female flowers were inhibited from maturing and abscissed. Male catkin development was also inhibited but to a lesser extent.

Winter wheat grains (Triticum aestivum L.), cultivars Abu-Ghureb and Cham 6 were used to investigate the effect of soaking seeds in 300 ppm of benzyl adenine (BA) or <b>daminozide</b> solutions for 6 hours before sowing vegetative, yield components, leaf chlorophylls and some chemical constituents of seeds. BA treatment led to significant increases in tiller number plant- 1, chlorophyll b, P, dry gluten, N and protein contents of seeds. It also led to significant decreases in number of leaves plant- 1. In addition, the number of tillers plant- 1, shoots dry weight plant- 1, P, N and protein contents of seeds were increased by <b>daminozide</b> treatment, but this caused {{a significant decrease in}} the plant height, number of leaves plant- 1 and flag leaf area. Number of grains plant- 1, weight of 1000 grains and grains yield were significantly increased by both treatments. Cultivar variability was noted for some tested parameters. The tall, N, P content and protein content of Abu-Ghureb cultivar were higher significantly than Sham 6. The case was opposite with number of leaves plant- 1, flag leaf area, shoots dry weight plant- 1, spike length and grain number plant- 1...|$|E
40|$|N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is an {{emerging}} disinfection byproduct, and {{we show that}} use of chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) {{has the potential to}} increase NDMA formation in waters containing precursors with hydrazine moieties. NDMA formation was measured after oxidation of 13 amines by monochloramine and ClO 2 and pretreatment with ClO 2 followed by postmonochloramination. <b>Daminozide,</b> a plant growth regulator, was found to yield 5. 01 ± 0. 96 % NDMA upon reaction with ClO 2, although no NDMA was recorded during chloramination. The reaction rate was estimated to be ∼ 0. 0085 s– 1, and on the basis of our identification by mass spectrometry of the intermediates, the reaction likely proceeds via the hydrolytic release of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), with the hydrazine structure a key intermediate in NDMA formation. The presence of UDMH was confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. For 10 of the 13 compounds, ClO 2 preoxidation reduced NDMA yields compared with monochloramination alone, which is explained by our measured release of dimethylamine. This work shows potential preoxidation strategies to control NDMA formation may not impact all organic precursors uniformly, so differences might be source specific depending upon the occurrence of different precursors in source waters. For example, <b>daminozide</b> is a plant regulator, so drinking water that is heavily influenced by upstream agricultural runoff could be at risk...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effects of doses and time of application of different growth regulators on sweetsorghum and its influence on plant development and germination of seeds produced, an experiment in a greenhousewas set up in September 2011, in Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil, at Embrapa Maize and Sorghum, with three commercialactive ingredients (trinexapaque-ethyl, paclobutrazol and <b>daminozide),</b> six doses for each product and two applicationtimes throughout the cycle. It was observed that the active ingredient Trinexapaque-ethyl was the most effective inreducing the height of sweet sorghum when applied twice during the crop cycle, but it promoted serious damage onseed quality...|$|E
