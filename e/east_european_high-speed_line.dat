5000|$|The {{development}} of an integrated <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> rail network is overcoming some of these differences. All <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> outside of Russia, including those built in Spain and Portugal, use [...] tracks. Likewise all <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines,</b> outside of Germany, Austria and Italy use 25 kV AC electrification (Electrification of high-speed rail in Italy is mixed 3kV DC and 25kV AC). This means that by 2020 high-speed trains can travel from Italy to England, or Portugal to the Netherlands {{without the need for}} multi-voltage systems or breaks of gauge.|$|R
50|$|The next year, in 1977, Germany finally {{introduced}} a new service at 200 km/h, on the Munich-Augsburg line. That same year, Italy inaugurated the first <b>European</b> <b>High-Speed</b> <b>line,</b> the Direttissima between Roma and Florence, designed for 250 km/h, but used by FS E444 hauled train at 200 km/h. This year also saw the abandonment for political reasons of the Aérotrain project, in favour of the TGV.|$|R
50|$|The Netherlands is {{connected}} to the <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> rail network with one dedicated <b>high-speed</b> <b>line,</b> HSL-Zuid, and improved traditional rail. Plans for a second dedicated <b>high-speed</b> <b>line,</b> HSL-Oost, have been cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|Since January 2010, {{a system}} of [...] "open access" [...] on <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> railway <b>lines</b> now permits {{different}} rail operators to apply to run high-speed passenger services. DB Fernverkehr have announced their intention to operate a direct ICE service from Cologne to London St Pancras via Brussels and the Channel Tunnel. The proposal, first put forward in 2007, was delayed by Eurotunnel safety regulations which required operators to use trainsets which could be divided in the Tunnel {{in the event of}} an emergency, allowing passengers to be transported out of the tunnel in two directions. This regulation has now been relaxed, and it was envisaged that DB could begin direct London-Cologne services before the end of 2014. These plans have since been delayed, and services are not expected to start until at least 2018.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Eurotunnel (the {{owners of}} the Channel Tunnel) {{announced}} that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the deregulation of <b>European</b> railway service, <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) {{announced that it was}} considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.|$|R
40|$|The <b>East</b> <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> rail {{started in}} June 2007. It modifies the French and European {{transportation}} map and {{the accessibility of}} the beneficiary cities. Economic actors in these cities do expect a lot of positive effects: economic dynamism, new firms and population arrival, development of office & corporate real estate programs around the central station, tourism expansion and so on. There are {{also a lot of}} High-Speed Rail projects in a lot of countries (Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Portugal, USA, etc.) and a lot of hopes. But the myth according to which transport infrastructures {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth has been for a long time challenged by economists. In fact, several researches show that in the field of economic dynamism, no significant effects result from infrastructures alone. (Bonnafous et Plassard, 1974, Plassard, 1977, Offner, 1993, Vickerman, 1991, Bazin, Beckerich et Delaplace, 2006, Blanquart et Delaplace, 2009). It doesn't mean that they don't contribute to new dynamics for these territories, but they aren't sufficient (Troin, 1997). Nevertheless, in some areas, there is local economic dynamic linked to an HSR arrival. These dynamics perpetuate the myth among the politicians that HSR can contribute to local development. Consequently this myth is still very present in political speeches. The aim of the paper is present a review of all the literature, the academic literature but also the political speeches and reports to identify the reasons why such a gap exists between scientific knowledge and these political speeches. We argue that we must to produce scientific knowledge allowing to identify the necessary conditions for a HSR to contribute to a local economic development. By analyzing the arrival of a High-Speed Rail Service (HSRS) in a territory as a service innovation (Delaplace, 2009) that can give birth to complementary service innovations, we will show that the collective appropriation of these innovations is central to generating positive effects...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s new <b>high-speed</b> passenger <b>lines</b> in Spain have been built to the international standard gauge of , to allow these lines to link to the <b>European</b> <b>high-speed</b> network. Although the 22 km from Tardienta to Huesca (part of a branch from the Madrid to Barcelona <b>high-speed</b> <b>line)</b> has been reconstructed as mixed Iberic and standard gauge, in general the interface between the two gauges in Spain is dealt with by means of gauge-changing installations, which can adjust the gauge of appropriately designed wheelsets on the move.|$|R

As of March 2010 Eurotunnel, High Speed 1, DB and other interested train operators formed a working group to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing DB's 200 m trains through the tunnel on a Frankfurt to London service.|$|R
