40|$|We use a {{suite of}} high {{resolution}} molecular cloud simulations carried out with the moving mesh code Arepo to explore the nature of star-forming filaments. The simulated filaments are identified and categorised from column density maps {{in the same manner}} as for recent Herschel observations. When fit with a Plummer-like profile the filaments are in excellent agreement with observations, and have shallow power-law profiles of p~ 2. 2 without the need for magnetic support. When data within 1 pc of the <b>filament</b> <b>centre</b> is fitted with a Gaussian function, the average FWHM is ~ 0. 3 pc, in agreement with predictions for accreting filaments. However, if the fit is constructed using only the inner regions, as in Herschel observations, the resulting FWHM is only ~ 0. 2 pc. This value is larger than that measured in IC 5146 and Taurus, but is similar to that found in the Planck Galactic Cold Cores and in Cygnus X. The simulated filaments have a range of widths rather than a constant value. When the column density maps are compared to the 3 D gas densities, the filaments seen in column density do not belong to a single structure. Instead, they are made up of a network of short ribbon-like sub-filaments reminiscent of those seen in Taurus. The sub-filaments are pre-existing within the simulated clouds, have radii similar to their Jeans radius, and are not primarily formed through fragmentation of the larger filament seen in column density. Instead, small filamentary clumps are swept together into a single column density structure by the large-scale collapse of the cloud. Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures. Accepted by MNRA...|$|E
40|$|Transversal and {{longitudinal}} {{homogeneity of}} Bi- 2223 /Ag tapes {{made by a}} tape-in-rectangular tube process with high filament aspect ratio was studied. Spatially resolved transport measurements (“magnetic knife”), Hall probe measurements and local V–I measurements were used to obtain the Ic distribution across and/or along the tape sample. The Ic distribution in {{the width of the}} filaments shows a minimum in the <b>filaments</b> <b>centre</b> and a maximum is measured near the filament edges. A periodical variation of longitudinal Ic values is observed by local V–I and by Hall probe measurements. Transversal and longitudinal filaments cross-sections were obtained and compared to transport critical currents...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown, {{that in the}} polycaryons life cycle, the stage-by-stage {{formation}} of a single cellular centre, analogous to the cellular centre of the single-nuclear cells in structure, takes place. In {{the life cycle of}} the polycaryon, a single centersome is twice active as the microtubes organisation centre (MTOC) and once as the intermediate <b>filaments</b> organisation <b>centre</b> (IFOC). The beginning of the formation of the single cellular centre has been timed to the first activation of a single centersome as MTOS. At the same time, the approximation of the nuclei and the aggregation of the secondary lysosomes in the polycaryons take place. The disturbance of the microfilaments integrity with cytochalasine B brings to the delay of formation of the single cellular sentre; the inactivation of a single centersome as the intermediate filament organisation sentre; to the displacement of the nuclei and intermediate filaments to the polycaryons peripheryAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5000|$|With {{substantial}} evidence, Hugh Huxley formally {{proposed the}} mechanism for sliding filament and is variously called swinging cross-bridge model, cross-bridge theory or cross-bridge model. (He himself preferred the name [...] "swinging crossbridge model", because, as he recalled, [...] "it discovery was, after all, the 1960s".) He published his {{theory in the}} 20 June 1969 issue of Science under the title [...] "The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction". [...] According to his theory, filament sliding occurs by cyclic attachment and detachment of myosin on actin filaments. Contraction occurs when the myosin pulls the actin <b>filament</b> towards the <b>centre</b> of the A band, detaches from actin and creates a force (stroke) to bind to the next actin molecule. This idea was subsequently proven in detail, and is more appropriately known as the cross-bridge cycle.|$|R
40|$|Narrow-band HST imaging has {{resolved}} the detailed internal {{structure of the}} 10 kpc diameter H alpha+[NII] emission line nebulosity in NGC 4696, the central galaxy in the nearby Centaurus cluster, showing that the dusty, molecular, filaments have a width of about 60 pc. Optical morphology and velocity measurements indicate that the filaments are dragged out by the bubbling action of the radio source {{as part of the}} AGN feedback cycle. Using the drag force we find that the magnetic field in the filaments is in approximate pressure equipartition with the hot gas. The filamentary nature of the cold gas continues inward, swirling around and within the Bondi accretion radius of the central black hole, revealing the magnetic nature of the gas flows in massive elliptical galaxies. HST imaging resolves the magnetic, dusty, molecular <b>filaments</b> at the <b>centre</b> of the Centaurus cluster to a swirl around and within the Bondi radius.

40|$|I {{review the}} major surveys of high {{redshift}} galaxies observed using integral field spectroscopy techniques in the visible {{and in the}} infrared. The comparison of various samples {{has to be done}} with care since they have different properties linked to their parent samples, their selection cri-teria and the methods used to study them. I present the various kinematic types of galaxies that are identified within these samples (rotators, mergers, etc.) and summarize the discussions on the mass assembly processes at various redshifts deduced from these classifications: at interme-diate redshift (z ∼ 0. 6) merger may be the main mass assembly process whereas the role of cold gas accretion along cosmic web filaments may increase with redshift. The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is also discussed. This relation seems to be already in place 3 Gyr after the Big-Bang and is then evolving until the present day. This evolution is interpreted as an increase of the stellar mass content of dark matter haloes of a given mass. The discovery of positive abundance gradients in MASSIV and LSD/AMAZE samples is highlighted. At z ∼ 3 this discovery might be linked to cold gas accretion along cosmic <b>filaments</b> toward the <b>centre</b> whereas at lower redshift (z ∼ 1. 3), this may be mainly due to accretion of gas from outer reservoirs toward the centre via tidal tails due to interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of an equilibrium tokamak plasma {{to a sudden}} localized deposition of heat is investigated by means of numerical simulations of the time-dependent equations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in two spatial dimensions, {{in order to obtain}} {{a better understanding of the}} structure and dynamics of the hot plasma filaments that are observed in recent tokamak experiments. Simulation results show that the fast heating generates MHD waves and creates a localised hot filament. Pressure perturbations are carried away from the heated area by slow waves, even when the heating is applied on the Alfvén time scale. When a temperature-dependent resistivity is considered, a current peak is formed at the place of the temperature peak, and the order of magnitude of the current is given by the condition that ηJz is constant. Next to the wave dynamics, the simulations show another type of hot filament dynamics caused by j × B forces. These forces drive <b>filaments</b> to the <b>centre</b> of the plasma at a nearly constant velocity, which decreases for smaller resistivities. Two filaments can merge under the influence of this current–current interaction. This process happens on a very long time scale. For realistic tokamak resistivities, the coalescence of filaments may take place on time scales of the order of the experimentally reported lifetime of filaments, and may thus be the mechanism that determines the lifetime of the filamentation process. 1...|$|R
40|$|Myosin II is {{the motor}} protein that {{produces}} force and shortening in muscle by ATP-driven cyclic interactions of its globular portion, the head, with the actin filament. During each interaction the myosin head undergoes a conformational change, the working stroke, which, {{depending on the}} mechanical conditions, can generate a force of several piconewtons or an axial displacement of the actin <b>filament</b> toward the <b>centre</b> of the sarcomere of several nanometres. However, the sizes of the elementary force and length steps and their dependence on the mechanical conditions are still under question. Due to the {{small fraction of the}} ATPase cycle time myosin II spends attached to actin, single molecule mechanics failed to produce definitive measurements of the individual events. In intact frog muscle fibres, however, myosin II's working stroke can be synchronised in the few milliseconds following a step reduction in either force or length superimposed on the isometric contraction. Here we show that with 150 μs force steps it is possible to separate the elastic response from the subsequent early rapid component of filament sliding due to the working stroke in the attached myosin heads. In this way we determine how the size and the speed of the working stroke depend on the clamped force. The relation between mechanical energy and force provides a molecular basis for muscle efficiency and an estimate of the isometric force exerted by a myosin head...|$|R
40|$|Okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin A (CLA), {{which are}} potent and {{specific}} inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 1 and 2 A, {{have been shown}} to induce drastic changes in platelet morphology. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the molecular mechanisms of OA- or CLA-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, with a specific focus on microtubules and actin filaments. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that OA or CLA altered the distribution of microtubules from marginal band arrangements to homogeneous patterns, consistent with the transmission-electron-microscopic finding that microtubules were fragmented and redistributed into pseudopod-like processes. In thrombin-activated platelets, OA or CLA induced extremely long pseudopods containing an array of microtubules and actin filaments, and a condensed mass of actin <b>filaments</b> in the <b>centre</b> of platelets. OA or CLA induced the constriction of actin filaments without an increase in filamentous (F) -actin, and also rather significantly inhibited actin polymerization in thrombin-activated platelets. Furthermore, neither OA or CLA enhanced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). By immunoprecipitation of platelet lysate with anti-alpha-tubulin antibody, a 90 kDa protein was co-precipitated with tubulin and was predominantly phosphorylated in the presence of OA. As the time-dependent phosphorylation of 90 kDa protein correlated well with the reorganization of microtubules, these data suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of this protein might play a role in the regulation of microtubule organization. These findings indicate that OA or CLA induces reorganization of microtubules and actin filaments via the phosphorylation of a microtubule-associated 90 kDa protein and an MLC-phosphorylation-independent mechanism. mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{reproduce}} the density profiles for filaments {{that are in}} magnetohydrostatic and pressure equilibrium with their surroundings obtained in Tomisaka (2014) and show that these equilibria are dynamically stable. If the effect of ambipolar diffusion is considered, these filaments lose magnetic support initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux. Rather the magnetic flux is redistributed within the <b>filament</b> from the <b>centre</b> towards the envelope. The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional ionisation and two gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion regimes for the collapse are observed as predicted in Mouschovias & Morton (1991). For high values of the ionisation coefficient, that is X ≥ 10 ^- 7, the gas is strongly coupled to the magnetic field and the Jeans length {{is larger than the}} ambipolar diffusion length scale. Then the collapse is governed by magnetically-regulated ambipolar diffusion. For X ≲ 10 ^- 8, the gas is weakly coupled to the magnetic field and the magnetic support is removed by gravitationally-dominated ambipolar diffusion. Here, neutrals and ions only collide sporadically, that is the ambipolar diffusion length scale is larger than the Jeans length. When decaying turbulence is included, additional support is provided to the filament. This slows down the collapse of the filament {{even in the absence of}} a magnetic field. When a magnetic field is present, the collapse rate increases by a ratio smaller than for the non-magnetic case. This is because of a speed-up of the ambipolar diffusion due to larger magnetic field gradients generated by the turbulence and because the ambipolar diffusion aids the dissipation of turbulence below the ambipolar diffusion length scale. The highest increase in the rate is observed for the lowest ionisation coefficient and the highest turbulent intensity. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication by A&...|$|R
5000|$|Excitation-contraction {{coupling}} in cardiac muscle cells occurs when an action potential is initiated by pacemaker {{cells in the}} Sinoatrial node or Atrioventricular node and conducted to all cells in the heart via gap junctions. The action potential travels along the surface membrane into T-tubules (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes extracellular [...] to enter the cell via L-type calcium channels and possibly sodium-calcium exchanger during {{the early part of}} the plateau phase. This [...] influx causes a small local increase in intracellular [...] The increase in [...] is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases [...] in a positive feedback physiological response. This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release [...] and gives rise to calcium sparks ( [...] sparks). The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 [...] sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above). Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin <b>filament</b> toward the <b>centre</b> of the sarcomere. Intracellular calcium is taken up by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin. Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the sodium-calcium exchanger and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase and/or taken up by the mitochondria. An enzyme, phospholamban, serves as a brake for the ATPase. At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that [...] does not have to leave the cell entirely. At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus removing most [...] from the cell back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This allows the heart muscles to relax to allow for ventricular filling. Intracellular calcium concentration drops and troponin complex returns over the active site of the actin filament, ending contraction.|$|R
