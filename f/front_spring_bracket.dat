These Combined Frame Stretcher & <b>Spring</b> <b>Brackets</b> are often referred to as [...] "sub-frames".

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>Spring</b> Perches - Some {{owners have}} {{reported}} rust {{problems on the}} <b>front</b> <b>spring</b> perches - the top perches, which hold {{the tops of the}} <b>springs</b> for the <b>front</b> suspension. The perches are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the perches to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.|$|R
50|$|The Speed Four is {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} its predecessor, the TT600, with the exceptions of the cam profiles, ignition and fuel injection mapping, <b>front</b> <b>spring</b> rate, and other minor concessions to its streetfighter style; {{the frame and}} fully adjustable suspension are race-ready.|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to requests from United States distributors Bud Forman and Les Genser Triumph developed {{a version of}} the TR4A fitted with a TR4-style rear live axle and made IRS an extra-cost option for that market. To locate the newly re-introduced leaf <b>springs,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> were added to the revised chassis. Live axle cars received a commissioning number (Triumph did not use serial numbers) that started with [...] "CT". This was the same prefix used for TR4s.

50|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 55 mph. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a 12.5 in drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding 12 in drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf <b>springs</b> on both <b>front</b> and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. The axle is located by a triangular strut linking axle and chassis and the main drive thrust is transmitted to the car by links between the ends of the axle and forward <b>spring</b> <b>brackets.</b> By this means the springs are only responsible for suspension. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|R
