40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} which MR-arthrography findings {{are associated with}} positive hip joint distraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with MR arthrography of the hip using axial traction were included. Traction was applied during the MR examination with an 8 kg (females) or 10 kg (males) water bag, attached to the ankle over a <b>deflection</b> <b>pulley.</b> Fifty patients showing joint space distraction were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group of 50 patients that did not show a joint distraction under axial traction. Two radiologists assessed the neck-shaft angle, lateral and anterior center-edge (CE) angles, CE angles in the transverse plane, extrusion index of the femoral head, acetabular depth, alpha angle, acetabular version, ligamentum teres, joint capsule and ligaments, iliopsoas tendon and the labrum. RESULTS: Mean joint space distraction in the study group was 0. 9 ± 0. 6 mm. Patients with positive joint space distraction had significantly higher neck-shaft angles (control group 131. 6 ± 5. 4 °/study group 134. 1 ± 6. 1 °, p < 0. 05), smaller lateral CE angles (38. 1 ± 5. 9 °/ 34. 6 ± 7. 2 °, p < 0. 05), smaller overall transverse CE angles (161. 4 ± 9. 9 °/ 153. 6 ± 9. 6 °, p < 0. 001), smaller acetabular depth (4. 1 ± 2. 4 mm/ 5. 8 ± 2. 5 mm, p < 0. 01), higher alpha angles (53. 5 ± 7. 8 °/ 59. 2 ± 10. 1 °, p < 0. 01) and a thicker ligamentum teres (4. 7 ± 1. 4 mm/ 5. 4 ± 1. 8 mm, p < 0. 05). The other parameters revealed no significant differences. ICC values for interobserver agreement were 0. 71 - 0. 95 and kappa values 0. 43 - 0. 92. CONCLUSION: Increased neck-shaft angles, small CE angles, small acetabular depth, higher alpha angles and a thick ligamentum teres are associated with positive joint distraction...|$|E

40|$|The power {{transmission}} efficiency of continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) {{based on the}} pushing metal belt is acknowledged to be {{lower than that of}} discrete ratio alternatives. This tends to negate the potential fuel economy benefits that are obtained by improved engine/load matching with a CVT. This series of three papers details an investigation into the loss mechanisms that occur within the belt drive as a first step to obtaining improvements in efficiency. This third paper follows on from two previous papers in which an analysis was performed modelling the torque losses that occur due to relative motion between the bands and segments of the belt, and between the pulleys and the belt due to <b>pulley</b> <b>deflection</b> effects. It describes additional experimental work, measuring the belt-slip speed tangentially about both of the pulleys in the variator. Additional loss models are proposed beyond those discussed in Parts 1 and 2 to describe the belt-slip phenomena, based on existing theory proposed by others. The analysis produced in this paper is validated against a range of experimental data and additionally through its close interaction with the torque-loss and torque-force distribution models proposed in Parts 1 and 2. The work takes into account new findings in other research and changes {{in the design of the}} current metal V-belt...|$|R
30|$|Driveline {{efficiency}} {{can significantly}} affect car fuel economy, and studying this relationship through bench and road tests requires long working periods, high costs, and heavy workloads. Such tests {{can also lead}} to certain blindness for the determination of vehicle and various assembly schemes, the selection of structural parameters and the matching of driveline parameters with an engine, all of which can affect the creation of a better matching program, result in an unsatisfactory product performance, and wastage of resources [1]. Therefore, various computer simulation forecasting methods assisted by bench tests have been widely adopted to optimize driveline matching and study transmission efficiency. Such methods can improve design quality, shorten the development cycle, and reduce costs [2]. Numerous studies on the efficiency of CVT and gearbox have been conducted through bench tests in China and abroad. Akehurst et al. [3 – 5] used bench tests to study torque losses in a metal belt CVT, which were caused by the relative sliding motion between belt segments and bands. They then forecasted and studied torque losses between belt segments and bands caused by the bending and deformation of the pulley based on experimental observations of <b>pulley</b> <b>deflections.</b> Furthermore, they studied the sliding speed of belt segments relative to the primary and secondary pulleys and its effects on torque loss, after which they proposed a model for the effects. They validated their proposed model using a number of experimental data. Meanwhile, various transmission power losses of CVT have been analyzed, and the transmission efficiencies of metal belts have been measured through bench tests [6]. However, the effects of CVT efficiency on car fuel economy have not yet been studied through real car tests. Huang et al. [7] conducted a CVT efficiency bench test using an electronically controlled gasoline engine as the power source, in which ratio, torque, and torque transmission ranges with high efficiency were measured. However, they did not validate the results using a real car test. In addition, researchers have investigated the influences of gear precision, bearing fit quality, and gear oil in the gearbox on transmission efficiency. Wang et al. [8] selected manual transmission as the research object to determine the influence of different gear precisions on transmission drive efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests. The results showed that a high-precision gear with a grinding process could evidently improve transmission drive efficiency. Gear precision mainly influences mesh precision and transmission dynamic stability. Considerable work has been done to analyze the influence of different types of gear oil on transmission efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests [9 – 11]. Similarly, Zhu et al. [12] studied the power loss of CVTs, including torque loss and speed loss, based on the transmission mechanism of CVTs, and experiments on CVT efficiency were conducted on a specific CVT test bench. Furthermore, they provided optimal structural parameters to serve as references for designing and tuning CVTs.|$|R
