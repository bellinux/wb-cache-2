2500|$|Hawkins {{said his}} {{feelings}} about Keeble echo those of all who knew him. [...] "If he was alive today, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> there's no one I respect more, and how he is everything a man should be: brave, kind and generous. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how proud I am of him, and how I never realized that all this time, I was living with such greatness." ...|$|E
60|$|I answered, {{well enough}} {{now that we}} were {{together}} again, {{and for the rest}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> later.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{nor would}} I. If I really were {{attached}} to a man, I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so, and agree to wait, either with hope or without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of Cato and Brutus, {{feeling that}} I could not stir him to {{grandeur}} of heart by Roman instances. He {{would have told}} me that in those days, as far as the Romans knew, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thunder! What are you {{thinking}} of? Go and ask him for three hundred dollars and odd? What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I want it for, pray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This last move," [...] he said, {{with great}} passion, [...] "has only {{been made in}} an attempt to punish me, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> was under a world of {{obligations}} to him for simply declaring the truth as to my birth. We cannot both be his eldest son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a ---- for Miss Dale's uncle," [...] said, Crosbie. [...] "If {{he were to}} walk in at {{that door}} this moment, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the whole story, without--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh Dick!' she said, {{when she}} had heard him to an end, 'how brave you are, and how proud. Yet I would not be proud with a father. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> all.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{asked how}} long {{he thought it would}} take. He said one week. I told him that in this voyage <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> all I knew, and he should tell me all he knew, to which he readily agreed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, perhaps, in your travels you may {{run across}} Tom. If you do <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to send word home. He {{ought to come}} home of himself, but I suppose he won't do that, he is so headstrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{answered}} {{that he was}} quite prepared to go by the window if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> first <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> whether to put his money in the Terra del Fuego Nitrate Company, Limited, or in the Union Pacific Bank. Life had no further interest for him. All he cared for was to feel that this little nest-egg was safely laid by {{for the benefit of}} his beloved ones after he was gone.|$|R
5000|$|Alina Bica, {{the former}} head of Romania’s Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), alleged that Lieutenant General Florian Coldea - a senior SRI General - would demand that {{specific}} people be arrested by her department. “When <b>I</b> <b>would</b> refuse, <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> there was not enough evidence, he would respond by saying” You are not right for the job you are in. You should change or you will not end well.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is {{an honest}} man. I hardly think that he can love me much. He {{was to have been}} my husband, but he will escape that. If I thought that he would live <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he was free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen,' she said, 'and try to understand. If I {{thought she}} hated him, I {{would tell her}} something. If she thought you hated them, {{he would tell me}} something. If ye or you thought he hated her, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> something. I will wait and see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pelham has {{no prior}} claim," [...] he answered. [...] "As {{soon as she}} is safe he shall know the whole truth. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> at this moment but that I am a little afraid of him. He would never understand, as we can, the {{intricacy}} of the situation. And now--to the prosaic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Miss Jane; he {{came into}} the shop, and bought some bread. He paid for it honestly; but I never did see any one so dirty. And there's Alfred wishing to be like <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> knew you <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> it is quite wicked, Miss Jane.' ...|$|R
60|$|Just before I {{began to}} feel deathly sick another {{reporter}} grappled me. What {{he wanted to know}} was the precise area of India in square miles. I referred him to Whittaker. He had never heard of Whittaker. He wanted it from my own mouth, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> Then he swerved off, just like the other man, to details of journalism in our own country. I ventured to suggest that the interior economy of a paper most concerned the people who worked it.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty trembled a little. [...] "It {{is going}} to be the hardest thing I ever did. He is just dreadful in his {{quietness}} when he is angry--and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had been meeting Larry and sending him dollars. You know what he would fancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor young man!" [...] cried Mrs. Jennings, [...] "I am sure {{he should}} be very welcome to bed and board at my house; and so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> if I could see him. It is not fit that {{he should be}} living about at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that we talked of the past, and speculated on the future. As the day grew older and less wistful, we forgot everything, and worked on, singing, and {{sometimes}} I would recite him verses as we went, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about books. Life was full of glamour for us both.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Of course I have not!' I exclaimed. 'Do {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{a thing like}} that, {{especially}} when I said I would not? The fact is,' I continued,--and {{it was very hard}} for me to keep from crying as I spoke,--'I am just loaded down with trouble, and I cannot tell anybody.' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{salary was}} {{increased}} yesterday {{to one hundred}} and fifty pounds a year. If I only knew where Mr. Mallinson was, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of our present happiness. But for the situation which his kindness procured for Robert, we might still have been waiting vainly for the day that has now come.|$|R
60|$|On {{his return}} to the hotel he had found a {{telegram}} waiting for him. Mr. Dunboyne the elder had arrived in London; and Philip had arranged to join his father by the next train. He sent me the address, and begged that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> my news from home by the next day's post.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, for {{the first}} time, my son sought me. He had come, he said, to make one request, and if I granted it, he would leave me in peace forever. <b>Would</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that my oath had been buried with the old life, and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> seek no harm to my old enemy? I simply {{declined}} to discuss the matter with him, and he went away.|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} them. I must. Nothing easier than to pry {{open a door}} or window in the north wing, by the ball-room. When I saw Grafton <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> Nay, I would write him that day. I was even casting about me for an implement, when I heard a step on the gravel beside me.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{overlook}} it! Let him dare to {{say such}} a word to me, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that his opinion in this matter was of less moment to me than {{that of any other}} creature in all Nuremberg. What is it to him who comes to me? Were it but for him, I would bid the young man come every day." ...|$|E
60|$|He left me abruptly; and {{although}} I felt that my doom had been spoken, I walked firmly {{across the square}} to meet Paul. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> everything. He should be my judge. My love should plead for me! It would triumph; yes! it would triumph! I was convinced of it! As for the danger I was in, I thought less of that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well,' said Captain Charteris, 'I'm glad, at least, {{that there}} is some one to have pity on the poor things! There's my brother's wife, she doesn't say no, but she talks of {{convenience}} and spoilt children--Sandbrook was quite right after all; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how she answered me! Spoilt children to be sure they are, poor things, but she might recollect they have no mother--such a fuss as she used to make with poor Lucilla too. Poor Lucilla, she would never have believed that [...] "dear Caroline" [...] would have no better welcome for her little ones! Spoilt indeed! A precious deal pleasanter children they are than any of the lot at Castle Blanch, and better brought up too.' ...|$|R
40|$|Key words assessment; {{statistical}} applications; {{structural equation}} modeling. A {{few years back}} I became friends with a research scientist {{who was a member}} of a molecular physics lab on campus. We mostly spent our time arguing about baseball (the pitcher should always bat), but occasionally we would talk about work. He was researching the development of a space elevator that consisted of a satellite placed in geo-synchronous orbit while tethered to the ground, allowing an elevator to deliver payloads to space. He would talk about things like nanotubes, microfabrication, noncovalent intermolecular forces, and molecular assemblers, and then would ask about my own current projects. After hearing about his work, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sheepishly <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about how I was trying to develop a measurement model for childhood depression. I described how we had gathered binary dat...|$|R
5000|$|Soto {{priest and}} former student of Katagiri-Roshi, Zuiko Redding, has stated, [...] "My basic memory of Katagiri is {{of how he}} paid total {{attention}} to what {{was in front of}} him. He took care of each thing {{as if it were the}} most important thing in the world, whether it was throwing away some trash or talking to another person. He really listened and tried to give the best answer he knew how to give. He also encouraged each of us to stand up in our own space, following our own wisdom rather than depending on him for answers or affirmation. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sometimes <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> exactly what I thought about some idea he had, only to turn and see him smiling broadly at me, glad that I wasn’t buying into his agenda." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In anybody's presence," [...] {{shouted out}} Pen. [...] "She {{is worthy of}} any place. She is as pure as any woman. She {{is as good as}} she is beautiful. If any man but you insulted her, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what I thought; but as you are my oldest friend, I suppose you have the {{privilege}} to doubt of my honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--but I {{meant to}} tell him. I {{determined}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> had he lived. When he sent for me I swore that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> If he is dying,--how can I say it?" [...] Lady Ushant sat bewildered, thinking over it, understanding {{nothing of the}} world in which this girl had lived, and not knowing now how things could have been as she described them. It was not as yet three months since, to her knowledge, this young woman had been staying at Bragton as the affianced bride of the owner of the house,--staying there with her own mother and his grandmother,--and now she declared that since that time she had become engaged to another man and that that other man had already jilted her! And yet she was here that she might make a deathbed parting with the man who regarded himself as her affianced husband. [...] "If I were sure that he were dying, why should I trouble him?" [...] she said again.|$|E
60|$|When I {{got up in}} the morning, {{refreshed}} {{and stronger}} yet, I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> before breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him; for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "How's a' wi' ye the day, Monkbarns? I havena had {{the grace}} {{yet to come}} down to thank your honour for the credit ye did puir Steenie, wi' laying his head in a rath grave, puir fallow. [...] "--Here she whimpered and wiped her eyes with the corner of her blue apron--"But the fishing comes on no that ill, though the gudeman hasna had the heart to gang to sea himsell-- Atweel <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fain <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> it wad do him gude to put hand to wark--but I'm maist fear'd to speak to him--and it's an unco thing to hear ane o' us speak that gate o' a man--However, I hae some dainty caller haddies, and they sall be but three shillings the dozen, for I hae nae pith to drive a bargain ennow, and maun just tak what ony Christian body will gie, wi' few words and nae flyting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bottle," [...] {{insisted the}} aunt firmly. [...] "After that {{exhibition}} of his this afternoon, Bottle, {{and nothing but}} Bottle, is how I shall always think of him. However, what I {{was going to say}} was that, if you see <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he has made an old woman very, very happy. Except for the time when the curate tripped over a loose shoelace and fell down the pulpit steps, I don't think I have ever had a more wonderful moment than when good old Bottle suddenly started ticking Tom off from the platform. In fact, I thought his whole performance in the most perfect taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And sometime," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "when {{all this}} has blown over a little, I shall {{have a talk with}} your father. He {{undoubtedly}} understands that there is scarcely any question of my election. He probably realizes, too, that he has been in the--wrong, and that railroad domination must cease--he has already made several concessions, as you know. <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> from me that when I am governor, I shall make it a point to discuss the whole matter with him, and that he will find in me no foe of corporations. Justice is what I stand for. Temperamentally, I am too conservative, I am too much of a business man, to tamper with vested interests." ...|$|R
