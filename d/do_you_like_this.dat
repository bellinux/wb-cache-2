500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
2500|$|Penniman was 18 when Ethan Allen, {{liberated from}} the Tower of London, {{returned}} to his native State. [...] "I should like," [...] said Penniman, one evening in a mixed company in her step-father's parlor, [...] "above all things to see this Mr. Allen, of whom we hear such incredible things." [...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. It was late in the evening before Mr. Allen rose. He had not failed to observe the interest his conversation had excited in Penniman. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as he stood erect before her, and was about to depart—" [...] and now, Miss Brush, allow me to ask, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> Mr. Allen?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{received}} some positive early reviews. In USA Today, novelist Thomas Gifford compared Just This Once to another novel {{in the same}} genre, American Star by Jackie Collins. Gifford concluded: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> stuff, you'd be much, much better off with the one written by the computer." [...] The Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly declared that Susann [...] "would be proud. Lots of money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." ...|$|R

I remember perfectly his deep-toned, politely indifferent ‘Restez donc.’ He was mistaken. Already then I hadn’t the slightest intention to move. And if you ask me again how far conscious all this was the nearest answer I can make you is this: that I remained on purpose, but I didn’t know for what purpose I remained.

6000|$|A {{story goes}} that {{once in the}} {{twilight}} undergrowth of a forest of nut-bearing trees a number of little purblind creatures wandered, singing for nuts. On some of these purblind creatures the nuts fell heavy and full, extremely indigestible, and were quickly swallowed; on others they fell light, and contained nothing, because the kernel had already been eaten up above, and these light and kernel-less nuts were accompanied by sibilations or laughter. On others again no nuts at all, empty or full, came down. But nuts or no nuts, full nuts or empty nuts, the purblind creatures below went on wandering and singing. A traveller one day stopped one of these creatures whose voice was peculiarly disagreeable, and asked [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> sing <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Is it for pleasure that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, or for pain? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get out of it? Is it {{for the sake of}} those up there? Is it for your own sake--for the sake of your family--for whose sake? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think your songs worth listening to? Answer!" ...|$|R
40|$|This project {{deals with}} the question: What’s {{important}} for {{children with learning disabilities}} in their new school life in a special class and how does their visual voice give us an insight in this? This is studied through observations over 5 days, photos taken by three children with the given assignment of “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> about <b>this</b> school?” and follow-up interviews about these photographs. This empirical data is used in an interpretative analysis, where we found out that physical/sensual activity, relationships with certain others and individualism in the school seems important to our informants. We established that we can say something about the photographs that our children have taken, however it is difficult to say anything about their inner picture of these photographs because we are not able to step inside them but only interpret our way to an understanding of this. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} conclude on what they think is important, but it is only possible to say that there are some indications may be important to them. The most important knowledge that the project gives us is that children can express themselves through a visual voice...|$|R
5000|$|Monotrona {{shows and}} music are {{notoriously}} difficult to categorize {{but have been}} described as “a perfect balance between silliness and creepiness, not to mention … the best thing to happen to the sputtering corpse of electro since asymmetrical haircuts.” [...] In a 1996 interview with local Portland ‘zine Snipehunt, Monotrona mused: “When <b>you</b> <b>do</b> stuff <b>like</b> <b>this</b> where you’re being kind of goofy anyway--if you don’t spread that goofiness, then you’ve failed.” [...] She was even voted “Scariest Musical Performer” in Portland in 1996. This combination of fright and fun was perfectly captured when Monotrona performed on the kids’ dance show Chic-a-go-go in 1998. See YouTube Video of Monotrona on Chic-a-go-go.|$|R
6000|$|The girl blushed. This, {{which last}} Sunday would have set his nerves tingling, now gave him {{much the same}} feeling a man has when a dog that he owns wriggles and looks at him.

And yet--it was strange--but there seemed another face and form in the room too; and the itch in his nerves, was it for that--or for this?

6000|$|April 18. This is {{the only}} country in the world where the {{stranger}} is not asked [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> place?" [...] This is indeed a large distinction. Here the citizen does the talking about the country himself; the stranger is not asked to help. You get all sorts of information. From one citizen you gather the idea that Mauritius was made first, and then heaven; and that heaven was copied after Mauritius. Another one tells you that this is an exaggeration; that the two chief villages, Port Louis and Curepipe, fall short of heavenly perfection; that nobody lives in Port Louis except upon compulsion, and that Curepipe is the wettest and rainiest place in the world.
