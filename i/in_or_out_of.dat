This could be switched <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the circuit from the cockpit, which {{turned off the}} transmitter as well.

5|$|The {{title is}} {{considered}} a reboot of the series; instead of using a five-button guitar-shaped game controller, the game shipped with a six-button controller, arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic fingering positions than the five-button controller. The game includes 42 songs on the game's disc, presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an immersive experience. Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not backward compatible with previous songs from Guitar Hero games. Instead, the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV (GHTV) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> at any time, playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion. GHTV, through in-game rewards and microtransactions, supports the ability to play any song in the library, perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found, or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period {{as part of a}} Party Pass. Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game, with more added over time, averaging about six new songs each week.|$|E

5|$|The appeal {{began on}} 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nine Network lawyers {{argued that the}} network {{should be allowed to}} {{broadcast}} the first three episodes of the series, arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version, rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences. The network believed the first three episodes, which depicted events {{from the beginning of the}} underworld war in 1995, would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial. Goussis's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008. The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008. Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Victoria. During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal, and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network's application to appeal, and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete.|$|E

25|$|Watchung, in the 1900s was a semi-rural small {{community}} of about 3,200 people {{in comparison with}} the relatively larger and more urban communities of Plainfield and Somerville. The first mayor of the town was Henry Baldwin Macdonald, who served from 1926 to 1928. Even as late as the 1960s, it was common for residents to know one another by name, with few moving <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town. The 1967 Plainfield riots, however, caused an exodus of the large upper-middle class population from the nearby cities to the Watchung Hills area to communities such as Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township.|$|E

25|$|At first no {{suitable}} coffin for {{the body}} could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the Maury River. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it {{was used for the}} General's body, though it was a bit short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes. He was buried underneath Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, where his body remains.|$|E
25|$|On {{his way to}} exile, {{the former}} emperor {{and his family were}} escorted by former Insurgent leader NicolÃ¡s Bravo, who uncharacteristically treated Iturbide harshly. Though the republican {{movement}} had triumphed, the people still held Iturbide in high regard and greatly admired him. In {{his way out of the}} city, his carriage was surrounded by the people, the horses dismissed and the people sought to drag the carriage themselves out of the city. This treatment was customary in the entrances or exits of great figures <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a city. The soldiers escorting Iturbide prevented this from happening, and would henceforth lead the former emperor through hidden roads, as the government feared a popular rising in favor of Iturbide.|$|E
