500|$|Patchy the Pirate {{is stuck}} in traffic on US 101 near Encino and gets cross that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> new SpongeBob episode, and his super rare eight track also breaks down. [...] His cell phone rings, and Potty tells him to hurry because the episode is about to start. [...] Patchy tells Potty to record the episode, but Potty tells him that he threw the Betamax machine in the trash, making him more mad. [...] The traffic lines moves, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and finds out that [...] "Encino is gone", and then he cries {{that this is not}} the only time a Lost-City had occurred. He tells us that the episode is what we should watch instead of {{watching}} him suffer. Patchy gets his eight track fixed, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the third}} season were mixed {{compared}} to the previous two seasons. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Bell's performance, who she said deserved the [...] "truckload of glowing press notices for her work as the tightly wound, emotionally resilient young detective". Ryan thought Veronica's relationship with Keith was [...] "one of the best, if not the best, parent-child relationship on television", and described Logan and Veronica's on-screen chemistry as [...] "sizzling". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com felt that although the third season [...] "wasn't the strongest", it did show that Veronica Mars [...] "could not only survive but continue {{to find ways to}} reinvigorate itself". Zacharek liked newcomer Piz, and realized how much she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> character Dick. Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer felt that Veronica Mars [...] "easily has a few more seasons left in it", and described the writing as [...] "unfailingly hysterical and clever". McFarland praised the cast as [...] "without a doubt one of the most likable on television", and called Dohring [...] "the most beloved of the bunch".|$|E
2500|$|He had {{a memorable}} {{interview}} with Jeremy Paxman on election night, {{prior to the}} result being called in his own seat. Paxman opened the interview with the question [...] "so Michael, are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> limo?"—a reference to the expectation that the Conservatives were headed for defeat and thus {{he would no longer}} be a Minister. Portillo was then asked [...] "are we seeing the end of the Conservative Party as a credible force in British politics?". He has since revealed that, prior to the interview, he had already come to believe he had lost his seat: ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the series}} finale, Gilligan {{said that it}} was {{difficult}} to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." [...] Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he [...] "didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell," [...] stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was [...] "such an odd, dark story" [...] that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.|$|E
2500|$|Omar Nobles praised Deidrick's {{portrayal}} and stated: [...] "Deidrick’s enduring {{charm and}} emotional performances helped {{turn the tide}} {{in favor of the}} one-time bad boy" [...] which would lead to his popularity. Upon the announcement of Deidrick's departure, Michael Fairman described the actor as [...] "one of the best young actors on daytime." [...] Jamey Giddens said [...] "As much as I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> tall, drink of DiMera, I can't say I blame Deidrick." [...] Giddens attributed the decision to Chad's dramatic decline in screen time following Burnett's departure. Though sad about Deidrick's departure, Nobles said the actor had a great [...] "future ahead of him." [...] Fairman praised Deidrick for his portrayal of Chad's final scenes which aired on October 30, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Gilligan {{has said}} it has been {{difficult}} to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." [...] As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad made Walter more and more unsympathetic. Gilligan said: [...] "He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why." [...] Cranston said by the fourth season: [...] "I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's {{well on his way to}} badass." [...] Regarding White's fate in the series ending, Cranston foresaw it as [...] "ugly [...] redemption", although earlier, Gilligan divulged his plans to [...] "end on a high note, in a way that will satisfy everyone".|$|E

60|$|The {{national}} mind is {{awakened to}} the subject. Letters pour in every day, conveying marks of sympathy; directing {{the attention of}} the Snob of England to races of Snobs yet undescribed. 'Where are your Theatrical Snobs; your Commercial Snobs; your Medical and Chirurgical Snobs; your Official Snobs; your Legal Snobs; your Artistical Snobs; your Musical Snobs; your Sporting Snobs?' write my esteemed correspondents. 'Surely you are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> Cambridge Chancellor election, and omit showing up your Don Snobs, who are coming, cap in hand, to a young Prince of six-and-twenty, and to implore him to be the chief of their renowned University?' writes a friend who seals with the signet of the Cam and Isis Club. 'Pray, pray,' cries another, 'now the Operas are opening, give us a lecture about Omnibus Snobs.' Indeed, I should like to write a chapter about the Snobbish Dons very much, and another about the Snobbish Dandies. Of my dear Theatrical Snobs I think with a pang; and I can hardly break away from some Snobbish artists, with whom I have long, long intended to have a palaver.|$|E
