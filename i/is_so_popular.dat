25|$|The Australian National Household Survey of 2001 {{showed that}} {{cannabis}} in Australia is rarely used without other drugs. 95% of cannabis users also drank alcohol; 26% took amphetamines; 19% took ecstasy and only 2.7% reported not having used any other drug with cannabis. While {{research has been}} undertaken on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis on performing certain tasks, {{little research has been}} conducted on the reasons why this combination <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular.</b> Evidence from a controlled experimental study undertaken by Lukas and Orozco suggests that alcohol causes THC to be absorbed more rapidly into the blood plasma of the user. Data from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that three-quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available, this suggests that the two are substitutes.|$|E

The Bosque plants trees such as the “vikingo mexiquense” and the “vikingo canadiense” coming here has become a tradition for many families in the Mexico City area. It is a business that was conceived forty years ago as a way to help preserve the forest here as well as benefit economically. Visitors come to spend a day in the area and can cut trees only from designated locations. Picnicking is permitted with the requirement that no garbage is left behind. The Christmas tree area covers 300 acres (120 hectares), and cut trees are left to regrow instead of being killed. The park also hosts food stalls and a Christmas market, selling about 30,000 trees per year and employing 50 permanent and 250 seasonal workers.The money earned from the enterprise helps to preserve more wild areas of the mountains here. This work has earned a Premio Nacional de Ecología (National Ecology Prize). The only problem the forest experiences is that the enterprise <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that the roads leading to the area are jammed with traffic.|$|E
500|$|Here Be Dragons (1985) is {{the first}} of Penman's trilogy of novels about the medieval princes of Gwynedd.

And then, too, the story of Llewelyn the Great and Joanna, King John’s illegitimate daughter, is a remarkable one, which struck an emotional chord with many readers.” ...|$|E

500|$|In Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health, (1992) John Wiltshire {{explored}} the preoccupation with illness {{and health of}} Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of [...] "the body as sexuality", and more broadly how culture is [...] "inscribed" [...] on {{the representation of the}} body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style (2003), which connects artistic concerns with queer theory. Miller in his book began the [...] "queer" [...] reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> with gay men. Miller answered it is because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a [...] "dazzling verbal style", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside of the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.|$|E
500|$|N.menagensis {{is found}} {{primarily}} in coastal and lowland areas in northern and eastern Borneo, {{in the provinces}} of Brunei, Sabah, and East Kalimantan.

It does not occur on the island of Jolo or further to the east, as was claimed by one erroneous report from Mindanao. The species may be extinct on some Philippine islands, but is likely to persist on the smaller islands. Because the species <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> as a pet, zoologists Guy Musser and Lawrence Heaney suggested in 1985 that the Philippine populations may have been introduced there by humans.|$|E
500|$|The Morning Advertiser {{thought that}} [...] "There is an evident attempt {{to copy the}} creations of a foreign {{composer}} who <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses en bouffes."

One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, [...] "Here far away from all the world", was one of the [...] "single best items of the piece". In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan's Merchant of Venice score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication.
