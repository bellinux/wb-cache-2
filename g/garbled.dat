5|$|Ctesias, {{who wrote}} a history of Persia based on Persian archives, claimed there were 120,000 Persian and 7,000 Greek soldiers, but his account is {{generally}} <b>garbled</b> (for instance, placing this battle before Salamis, he also says there were only 300 Spartans, 1000 perioeci and 6000 from the other cities at Plataea, perhaps confusing it with Thermopylae).|$|E
5|$|In the {{aforesaid}} {{record of}} the military actions conducted in 1044, Ímar is merely named {{as the son of}} Aralt, a fact which could indicate that this was how he was known to his contemporaries.

5|$|Krueger did not {{immediately}} give Martin permission for such an operation. There was still the possibility of Japanese attack, and the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation. On 20 January, a visiting staff officer from Alamo Force was asked to raise the possibility with Krueger. However, on 21 January Martin received a letter stating that {{the mission of the}} Michaelmas Task Force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on 22 January to the effect that this was not consistent with Krueger's wishes. On 8 February, Martin received a <b>garbled</b> radiogram from Krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of 22 January had itself been <b>garbled,</b> and on 9 February a radiogram was received authorising offensive action. Plans were immediately made but on 10 February contact was made with elements of the Australian 5th Division, which had relieved the 9th Division on 20 January. This closed the gap on the east flank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Garbling</b> schemes (aka {{randomized}} encodings of functions) {{represent a}} function F by a “simpler” randomized function F ̂ such that F ̂ (x) reveals F (x) and no {{additional information about}} x. <b>Garbling</b> schemes have found applications {{in many areas of}} cryptography. Motivated by the goal of improving the efficiency of <b>garbling</b> schemes, we make the following contributions: – We suggest a general new notion of partial <b>garbling</b> which unifies several previous notions from the literature, including standard <b>garbling</b> schemes, secret sharing schemes, and “conditional disclosure of secrets”. This notion considers <b>garbling</b> schemes in which part of the input is public, {{in the sense that it}} can be leaked by F ̂. – We present constructions of partial <b>garbling</b> schemes for (boolean and arithmetic) formulas and branching programs which take advantage of the public input to gain better efficiency. – We demonstrate the usefulness of the new notion by presenting applications to efficient attribute-based encryption, delegation, and secure computation. In each of these applications, we obtain either new schemes for larger classes of functions or efficiency improvements fromquadratic to linear. In particular, we obtain the first ABE scheme in bilinear groups for arithmetic formulas, as well as more efficient delegation schemes for boolean and arithmetic branching programs. ...|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was <b>garbled</b> and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and <b>garbled</b> exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, <b>garbled</b> speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
50|$|Freddy {{discovers the}} missing chicks {{are in the}} <b>Garble</b> cellar. As a ruse, Freddy spreads {{strawberry}} jam on the burglar and shouts for help. The burglar escapes, believing Freddy has too. The Martians take {{the first of several}} joy rides, landing finally at the circus, where they are amused by the false Martians. After a time they realize Freddy still needs rescuing, so the sheriff, the Martians, and circus folk overwhelm <b>Garble's</b> house, freeing Freddy and the chicks. <b>Garble</b> escapes to join his confederates, the rats. Rats being difficult to dislodge, Freddy makes use of ten sacks of rotten onions to taint the food at the <b>Garble</b> place. The rats retaliate by invading the space ship, and eating the stores. The Bean farm animals surround the space ship, but the rats unintentionally cause it to lift off; the rats are rescued from space only much later, although Uncle Ben's space ship is lost. The Martians stay with the circus, giving saucer rides and enjoying themselves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Garble</b> escapes. He captures Freddy, Miss Anguish and Jinx, {{holding them}} for ransom. Miss Anguish tries to confuse their captors, but finally in desperation they set a fire to attract attention. <b>Garble</b> is recaptured {{and sent to}} prison. Simon and his {{criminal}} family are packed in a crate that is indefinitely shipped from place to place. The revolution fails. With the animal vote, Camphor becomes governor.|$|R

Since <b>Garble</b> is an old enemy, while Mr. Boom is a friend, Freddy visits the circus to warn him. <b>Garble</b> allows limited viewing of the Martians, so he must be lured away while Freddy's cohort Mrs. Peppercorn sneaks in. She finds the bearded Martians dressed in red costumes with gloves, and oddly [...] "like a dog walking on its hind legs". The Martian introduces himself, spelling his name S-i-m-g-h-k (with a silent [...] "i"). Inexplicably, Simghk is familiar with Freddy's poetry. He flatters Peppercorn, who eagerly explains she can do better: ...|$|R
5|$|Domhnall was, reputedly, {{the son of}} Raghnall (fl. 1192) son of Somhairle (died 1164). The 17th-century History of the Macdonalds by Hugh MacDonald of Sleat {{claimed that}} Domhnall's father Raghnall had married a {{daughter}} or sister of the early 14th-century hero Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. Sellar suggested that this tradition may have derived from a <b>garbled</b> version of reality. Perhaps, Sellar argued, {{his mother was a}} daughter of William fitz Duncan. The latter was another famous Earl of Moray, but one who lived in the 12th- rather than the 14th-century.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No.454) polemically {{mention the}} devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities {{and may be}} a <b>garbled</b> and {{confused}} version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.|$|E
5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a <b>garbled</b> account of a historical event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, The Green Child, written in 1934.|$|E

5000|$|Willy, {{the circus}} boa constrictor, is {{sleeping}} over at Freddy's. They are awoken by the chickens Charles and Henrietta, who accuse the snake of abducting their chicks. This sends Freddy into detective mode. In confirming that the revolving chicken house door cannot be entered {{by the large}} snake, he is stuck, squeals loudly, and rouses the barnyard. Dogs, tracking rat smell, find a hole. Willy slithers in, retrieving Simon the rat, Freddy's longstanding foe. Shortly after they hold Simon captive, <b>Garble</b> announces {{that one of his}} Martians is missing. <b>Garble</b> reveals that he purchased the Grimsby property next to the Bean farm, and is demanding Uncle Ben Bean remove his space ship (built in Freddy and the Space Ship). Freddy deduces that <b>Garble's</b> false Martians are actually rats and threatens to reveal <b>Garble's</b> hoax unless the space ship is allowed to remain. Besides, they cannot expose the fake Martians without embarrassing the circus. However Freddy's philosophy is [...] "When everything seems hopeless, the thing to do is stir it up good." ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a <b>garbled</b> recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been <b>garbled</b> in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth {{became a}} monk at Glastonbury, then was made {{dean of the}} monastery of Christ Church Priory, at Canterbury, the cathedral chapter for the diocese of Canterbury. He was also a {{chaplain}} to King Cnut of England and Denmark as well as Dean of Canterbury when on 13 November 1020 Æthelnoth was consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelnoth's elevation probably was a gesture of appeasement, as Æthelnoth's brother Æthelweard had been executed in 1017 by Cnut, who also banished a brother-in-law named Æthelweard in 1020. A later story stated that Cnut favoured Æthelnoth because Æthelnoth had bestowed chrism on the king. This may be a <b>garbled</b> account of Æthelnoth's participation in Cnut's confirmation as a Christian in 1016 or his coronation in 1017. There are some indications {{that he was a}} student of Ælfric of Eynsham, the homilist.|$|E

30|$|With limited {{commitment}} {{our results}} differ {{depending on the}} type of intertemporal correlation over time.

If the <b>garbling</b> is moderate, the early system dominates the late one only if the reduction in noise over time is below a critical value. Otherwise the late system is preferred. Thus with negative intertemporal correlation our results qualitatively resemble the full commitment ones.|$|R
