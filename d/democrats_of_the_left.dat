25|$|The {{candidacy}} of Massimo D'Alema {{was supported}} by his party, the <b>Democrats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Left,</b> and by other parties of the coalition, such as the Party of Italian Communists, the Communist Refoundation Party and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy, but opposed by others, such as the Rose in the Fist, arguing that his candidacy was driven by a particracy's mentality. Also, part of the left-wing coalition considered D'Alema far too willing to conduct backroom deals with the opposition. Some moderate journalists liked D'Alema because his presidency would have given Romano Prodi a stable government since the biggest party of the Union had not been rewarded with any institutional position.|$|E
25|$|Veltroni, a {{professional}} journalist, was editor-in-chief of L'Unità, the newspaper of the Democratic Party of the Left from 1992-1996.

Despite his background as a journalist, he {{has been involved in}} controversial episodes related to freedom of expression. For example, in 2001, after the late night show Satyricon aired an interview that discussed indictments on links between the right-wing leader and the mafia, Marco Travaglio reported that Veltroni dispatched a messenger menacing the closure of the show.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Sicily gives centre-right results during election. From 1943 to 1951 {{there was}} also a separatist {{political}} party called Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano, MIS). Its best electoral result was in the 1946 general election, when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all its seats following the 1948 general election and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the politics of Sicily. After World War II Sicily became a stronghold of the Christian Democracy, in opposition to the Italian Communist Party. The Communists and their successors (the Democratic Party of the Left, the <b>Democrats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Left</b> and the present-day Democratic Party) had never won in the region until 2012. Sicily is now governed by a centre-left coalition between Democratic Party and the centre-party Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. Rosario Crocetta is the current President since 2012.|$|E

Initially some of these experiments were intended to include both Christian-inspired parties and secular ones, such as SDI and PRI. However, on 12 October 2000, only PPI, Dem, UDEUR and RI agreed to join forces with a joint list called [...] "The Daisy" [...] for the 2001 general election.
