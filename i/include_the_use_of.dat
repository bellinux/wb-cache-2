DJ Hero uses a special turntable-based controller for players to perform with on various song mixes in the game. The game also incorporates {{the use of a}} Guitar Hero controller on ten specially arranged tracks; Bright has suggested that future Guitar Hero games after Guitar Hero 5 may <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the turntable control.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} the pudú species are being taken {{in order to prevent}} extinction. An international captive-breeding program for the southern pudú led by Concepcion University in Chile has been started. Some deer have been bred in captivity and reintroduced into Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina. Reintroduction efforts <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> radio collars for tracking. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has banned the international trading of pudús. The Wildlife Conservation Society protects their natural habitat and works to recreate it for pudús in captivity. Despite efforts made by the World Wildlife Fund, the size of the pudú population remains unknown. Threats to the pudús remain despite various conservation efforts.|$|E

Its New Testament rites include baptism (immersion) and footwashing, {{both of which have}} Old Testament origins.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock is {{considered}} one of North America's most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. Three members of the genus contain a toxin named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion. Medical treatment of poisoning may <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> activated charcoal to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with supportive care including anticonvulsant drugs such as a benzodiazepine. High doses of anticonvulsant medicine are often required to halt seizure activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance {{rather than for}} travel, {{according to a study}} in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E

5|$|Casa Álvarez-Buiza, {{a private}} house and {{commercial}} complex, {{was built in}} the San Juan district by Adel Franco Pinna between 1918–2. The building located on the Plaza de La Soledad once housed the offices of the Bank of Spain. Artistic elements <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> lime, brick and colorful ceramics with an Andalusian influence. Casa del Cordón is a private house, built in the late Gothic style of the early 16th century, and has mullioned windows. It currently houses the Archdiocese. Casa Puebla, built in 1921, is one of the other designs of Pinna, who designed numerous buildings around Badajoz. It {{is one of the best}} examples of regional architecture in Andalusian style and the property has two facades, the main one featuring neo-Renaissance elements.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, {{as compared to the}} French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
