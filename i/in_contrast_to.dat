5|$|GWA studies {{investigate}} the entire genome, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> methods that specifically test {{a small number}} of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.|$|E

5|$|Women {{fare better}} in Manchester {{than the rest}} of the country in terms of equal pay to men. The per hours worked gender pay gap is 3.3%, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> 11.1% for Great Britain. 37% of the working-age {{population}} in Manchester have degree level qualifications <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the average of 33% across other Core Cities, although schools under-perform slightly when compared to the national average.|$|E

5|$|A non-competitive {{inhibitor}} binds {{to a site}} {{other than}} where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence Km remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that Vmax is reduced. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} infectious agent stands <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, {{all of which}} contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis unproven.|$|E

5|$|Actinium trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000°C. However, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.|$|E

5|$|Although many fires {{likewise}} burnt {{following the}} bombing, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel {{to generate the}} phenomenon.
