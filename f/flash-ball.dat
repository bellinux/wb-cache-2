50|$|<b>Flash-Ball</b> is a {{registered}} trademark for a nominally non-lethal hand-held weapon used mainly by law enforcement officers in riot situations {{as an alternative to}} lethal firearms, baton rounds, and plastic bullets. It was developed by French hunting firearms manufacturer Verney-Carron.|$|E
50|$|The UTIP and GOE {{would use}} small arms {{unique to the}} Portuguese FBP m/948, such as the SIG SG 552 short assault rifle、Franchi SPAS-15 {{semi-automatic}} shotgun and the SIG-Sauer SSG 3000 sniper rifle. They also use Smith & Wesson-made 37 mm gas launchers, long batons and <b>Flash-ball</b> and taser for less-than lethal to control riots.|$|E
40|$|Less-lethal {{weapons are}} used in law {{enforcement}} to neutralize combative individuals and to disperse riot crowds. Local police recently used such an impact weapon, the <b>Flash-Ball,</b> in two different situations. This gun fires large rubber bullets with kinetic energies around 200 J. Although {{it is designed to}} avoid skin penetration, impacts at such energies may still create major trauma with associated severe injuries to internal organs. This is a report of 2 patients shot with the <b>Flash-Ball</b> who required medical attention. One could be discharged quickly, but the other required hospitalization for heart and lung contusion. Both patients required advanced investigations including computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical literature on injuries induced by less-lethal impact weapons is reviewed. Impacts from the <b>Flash-Ball</b> can cause significant injury to internal organs, even without penetration. Investigations as for other high-energy blunt traumas are called for in these cases...|$|E
5000|$|According to the manufacturer's own publicity, the <b>Flash-Ball's</b> {{standard}} round packs the {{stopping power}} of a [...]38 caliber handgun but considerably less kinetic energy per sq. cm thus making it unlikely to penetrate {{the body of a}} normally clothed person even at ranges down to 5 meters.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoft tissue {{injuries}} due {{to impact}} loading {{are a major}} health problem. The objective {{of this study was}} to simulate the impact of projectiles onto human body area and to show the validity of the model developed, based on a finite element model of the <b>flash-ball</b> impact on the human leg. To determine realistically the strain and stress in the biological soft tissues, anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws are necessary in the context of finite element analysis. The contact between impacting bodies is solved by the bi-potential method which consists of projecting the displacement equations onto the constraining directions associated to contact points. The time integration of the equation of motion is achieved by means of a first order algorithm. The algorithm is implemented into the finite element code FER/Impact using C++ Object Oriented Programming techniques. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering...|$|E
