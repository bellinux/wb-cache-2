5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E
5|$|Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose {{literary}} works included plays and poetry {{as well as}} opera libretti; Monteverdi had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title La finta pazza Licori. Feigned madness was a standard theme in the commedia dell'arte tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends to be mad, all {{as part of a}} strategy to win the heart of her lover, Aminta.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when he <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in {{the late}} 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

5|$|Her most {{documented}} {{romantic relationship}} was with Kurt Cobain. It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to know one another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the story, Takaaki meets {{several other}} heroines {{attending}} his school. The first is Manaka Komaki, a timid, clumsy, but accommodating {{girl who is}} the vice class representative of Takaaki's class. She often spends time in the school library's storage, and helps the library committee with general tasks. Similar to Takaaki, she is inarticulate around the opposite gender. Manaka is also close friends with Yuma Tonami, an aggressive girl who commutes to school by a mountain bike. Yuma sees Takaaki as a rival after she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at school, and often challenges him to various duels. She often laments her grandfather's insistence of having her take over the family business, and attempts to hide her family background from Takaaki. Karin Sasamori is a schoolmate of Takaaki's {{and the founder of}} the school's mystery club. Karin has a cheerful and energetic personality, and has an odd affection towards the occult and objects such as egg sandwiches. She first meets Takaaki early in the story, and later deceives him into joining the mystery club.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861–1862 Putnam was {{stationed}} in Cairo, Illinois. As Paymaster he worked in an office on the same floor connecting {{with the office of}} Ulysses S. Grant, where he <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> when he was then a brigadier general. While in Cairo he also met and came to know John Rawlins who was a captain, along with Colonels John McClernand and Lew Wallace and other Civil War notables. Here Putnam also became a good friend and companion of Major Hoyt Sherman, the younger brother of William T. Sherman. The two brothers up to that point had not seen each other in eleven years; Putnam witnessed and wrote about their reunion.|$|E
25|$|Margaret Mountford (Series 1-5) - Alongside {{recruiting}} Hewer to {{work with}} him on the programme, Alan Sugar also recruited Margaret as his second adviser, having worked with him since she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> while working as a partner for the law firm Herbert Smith, until March 1999. She remained with the show until she announced in her column for the Daily Telegraph on 1 June 2009, that the fifth series would be her last, citing that her departure would allow her to devote more time to her studies, with the decision fully confirmed during her appearance on You're Hired, after the final episode of Series 5. Despite departing from the role, she remained with the show for Series 6-9, acting as an interviewer for the Interviews stage of the competition.|$|E
25|$|There he {{was allowed}} to draw and paint imprisoned Russian officers, and his commander, Karl Moser (who assumed that Schiele was a painter and {{decorator}} when he <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him),</b> even gave him a disused store room to use as a studio. Since Schiele {{was in charge of the}} food stores in the camp, he and Edith could enjoy food beyond rations. By 1917, he was back in Vienna, able to focus on his artistic career. His output was prolific, and his work reflected the maturity of an artist in full command of his talents. He was invited to participate in the Secession's 49th exhibition, held in Vienna in 1918. Schiele had fifty works accepted for this exhibition, and they were displayed in the main hall. He also designed a poster for the exhibition, which was reminiscent of the Last Supper, with a portrait of himself in the place of Christ. The show was a triumphant success, and as a result, prices for Schiele's drawings increased and he received many portrait commissions.|$|E

5000|$|The Cajuns was {{inspired}} by a suggestion from James Carville: [...] "Gus was always telling stories, from the <b>first</b> day I <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> There aren't many people who can tell you the same story, like, eleven times and still make you want to hear it again. He's the best raconteur I've ever met." ...|$|R
500|$|Boulton's Soho site {{proved to}} have {{insufficient}} hydropower for his needs, {{especially in the}} summer when the millstream's flow was greatly reduced. [...] He realised that using a steam engine either to pump water {{back up to the}} millpond or to drive equipment directly would help to provide the necessary power. [...] He began to correspond with Watt in 1766, and <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> two years later. [...] In 1769 Watt patented an engine with the innovation of a separate condenser, making it far more efficient than earlier engines. Boulton realised not only that this engine could power his manufactory, but also that its production might be a profitable business venture.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison married Hetty Cary in 1894. They {{had four}} children: three daughters, Ursula, Constance, and Sally, and a son, Richard. He {{was a member}} of the Episcopal Church. [...] Harrison was {{described}} as [...] "physically imposing", and gray-haired in his middle age. Harry DeButts, an employee and protégé, described him as [...] "a little cold when you <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> but underneath he was a very warm, admirable, capable and wise man". He died on February 2, 1938, of heart disease, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia. [...] On the day after Harrison's death, the New York Times carried his obituary, but instead of a photograph of Harrison, the picture that ran with the obituary was of John Jeremiah Pelley, the president of the Association of American Railroads, who was still alive.|$|E
60|$|These {{were the}} first {{coherent}} words he had spoken since <b>first</b> she had <b>met</b> <b>him</b> here in this lonely part of the garden, and his voice was perfectly steady, conventional and cold.

500|$|In 1960, Ronald William Clark {{published}} a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing [...] "this very readable little book" [...] as being [...] "adulatory" [...] in tone, [...] "but hardly {{more so than}} its subject deserves." [...] In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes {{published a}} second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed [...] "a very great liking" [...] for Wheeler, having <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had [...] "a daemonic energy", with his accomplishments in India being [...] "almost superhuman". Ultimately, she {{thought of him as}} being [...] "an epic hero in an anti-heroic age" [...] in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.|$|E
500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|Streltsov {{was known}} for womanising, {{drinking}} heavily and leading an extravagant life outside of football, {{as well as for}} wearing his hair in the British [...] "Teddy Boy" [...] style. As a key player for his club and for the Soviet national side, these traits combined to create an impression in government circles that, in Wilson's words, [...] "Streltsov was becoming rather too much of a celebrity". The problem was brought to a head by an alleged relationship between the footballer and Svetlana Furtseva, the 16-year-old daughter of the first female Politburo member Ekaterina Furtseva. With the young Svetlana besotted by the 19-year-old Torpedo forward, her mother <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a Kremlin ball held early in 1957 to celebrate the Olympic victory of 1956. Furtseva suggested he might marry her daughter, to which Streltsov replied [...] "I already have a fiancée and I will not marry her [...]" [...] While drunk, he was later heard to remark either [...] "I would never marry that monkey" [...] or [...] "I would rather be hanged than marry such a girl" [...] (both quotes were reported), humiliating Furtseva, a minister close to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E

In addition, the band met Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, who saw the band perform on separate occasions in England.

500|$|Will's wife, Terri, {{returns to}} the series in [...] "Funk", giving her first vocal performance. Murphy planned a redemptive storyline for Terri, in which she realizes that Finn is similar to Will. He explained: [...] "She met Will at 16, so she sees a way to redemption... a way to redo that {{relationship}} {{in a positive way}} [...] almost as Finn's guardian angel, his fairy godmother. She gives him proper moral advice." [...] Murphy enjoyed seeing Gilsig and Monteith work together, so much so that he stated their friendship will continue into the show's second season. On June 2, 2010, Megan Masters of E! Online reported that Gilsig had yet to be officially invited back for the second season, but was confident that she would be. Discussing Terri's relationship with Finn, Gilsig explained: [...] "She sees in Finn so much of what she saw in Will when she <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> because he's the same age as Will was. It's her way of remembering happier times—when she used to be kind to Will. And she realizes, here's a chance to be supportive of this kid." ...|$|E
