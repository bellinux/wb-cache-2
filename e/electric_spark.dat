5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an <b>electric</b> <b>spark.</b> He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E

25|$|An {{oil burner}} is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the surface arc-resistance {{characteristics}} of electric insulating materials, {{it is necessary to}} derive the knowledge of deterioration process, hence, it is also important {{to study the}} temperture distribution on surface <b>electric</b> <b>sparking.</b> By the burning of <b>electric</b> <b>sparking</b> over the glassplate coated with organic membrane, accordingly, we examined the temperture distribution. Moreover, the experiment to study of influences of other outer conditions were carried out...|$|R
25|$|As {{reported}} by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600 BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> to jump. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1663, the German {{physicist}} Otto von Guericke {{created the}} first electric generator, which produced static electricity by applying friction in the machine. The generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated {{by means of a}} crank and an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. The globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with electricity.|$|E
500|$|To {{strike the}} welding arc, a high {{frequency}} generator (similar to a Tesla coil) provides an <b>electric</b> <b>spark.</b> This spark is a conductive path for the welding current through the shielding gas {{and allows the}} arc to be initiated while the electrode and the workpiece are separated, typically about [...] apart.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical {{discharge}} in air is {{the cause}} of blue light emitted by <b>electric</b> <b>sparks,</b> lightning, and corona discharges (e.g. St. Elmo's fire).|$|R
50|$|ESD {{can create}} {{spectacular}} <b>electric</b> <b>sparks</b> (lightning, with the accompanying sound of thunder, is a large-scale ESD event), but also less dramatic forms {{which may be}} neither seen nor heard, yet still {{be large enough to}} cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. <b>Electric</b> <b>sparks</b> require a field strength above approximately 40 kV/cm in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Other forms of ESD include corona discharge from sharp electrodes and brush discharge from blunt electrodes.|$|R
50|$|In {{an early}} {{electronic}} computing device, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, <b>electric</b> <b>sparks</b> {{were used to}} singe small holes in paper cards to represent binary data. The altered dielectric constant of the paper {{at the location of}} the holes could then be used to read the binary data back into the machine by means of <b>electric</b> <b>sparks</b> of lower voltage than the sparks used to create the holes. This form of paper data storage was never made reliable and was not used in any subsequent machine.|$|R
500|$|Just after 8:00am an {{explosion}} {{occurred in the}} west side of the underground workings. It is possible there were two explosions as survivors stated a smaller explosion preceded the main one, although the official report referred only to one. [...] The cause was probably a build-up of firedamp that was ignited by an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> from equipment such as electric bell signalling gear. The initial explosion ignited airborne coal dust, and a shock wave ahead of the explosion raised yet more coal dust, which also combusted. Many victims who were not killed immediately by the explosion and fire died from the effects of afterdamp. The explosive wave travelled up the Lancaster shaft to the surface, destroying the headframe; it killed the winder—the man in charge—and badly wounded his deputy.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the anode (positive electrode) while the cathode (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus. As the voltage increases, the current stresses the material (by electric polarization) beyond its dielectric limit (termed strength) into {{a stage of}} electrical breakdown, marked by an <b>electric</b> <b>spark,</b> where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor (as it becomes increasingly ionized). The underlying process is the Townsend avalanche, where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as {{can be seen in}} the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only [...] "after about 20 successive sets of collisions", mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).|$|E
500|$|Developed by Game Freak and {{published}} by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called [...] "Pokémon" [...] that players, called [...] "trainers", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the game's world. Pikachu {{was one of several}} different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design, which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori. According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the idea of the name came from a mouse like animal called pika and then derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> makes, and chu, a sound a mouse makes. Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name {{as one of the most}} difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-20th century, {{kerosene}} or tractor vaporising oil (TVO) {{was used}} as a cheap fuel for tractors. The engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. [...] A heat valve on the manifold would route the exhaust gases around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene {{to the point where it}} was vaporized and could be ignited by an <b>electric</b> <b>spark.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In November 1776, methane {{was first}} scientifically {{identified}} by Italian physicist Alessandro Volta in the marshes of Lake Maggiore straddling Italy and Switzerland. [...] Volta {{was inspired to}} search for the substance after reading a paper written by Benjamin Franklin about [...] "flammable air". Volta collected the gas rising from the marsh, and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas. He also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an <b>electric</b> <b>spark.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As John Munro {{wrote in}} 1891, [...] "In 1835, at the Dublin {{meeting of the}} British Association, Wheatstone showed that when metals were volatilised in the <b>electric</b> <b>spark,</b> their light, {{examined}} through a prism, revealed certain rays which were characteristic of them. Thus the kind of metals which formed the sparking points could be determined by analysing {{the light of the}} spark. This suggestion has been of great service in spectrum analysis, and as applied by Robert Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, and others, has led to the discovery of several new elements, such as rubidium and thallium, as well as increasing our knowledge of the heavenly bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lodge {{carried out}} {{scientific}} investigations on {{the source of}} the electromotive force in the voltaic cell, electrolysis, and the application of electricity to the dispersal of fog and smoke. [...] He also made a major contribution to motoring when he patented a form of <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> ignition for the internal combustion engine (the Lodge Igniter). Later, two of his sons developed his ideas and in 1903 founded Lodge Bros, which eventually became known as Lodge Plugs Ltd. He also made discoveries in the field of wireless transmission. In 1898, Lodge gained a patent on the moving-coil loudspeaker, utilizing a coil connected to a diaphragm, suspended in a strong magnetic field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proscenium}} arch housed a [...] drop curtain. The arch itself was not {{integral to the}} theatre but was constructed with a lightweight, plastered curtain wall made of wood. The drama was entirely lit with gaslight controlled by a man at a gas table, who could light a lamp through an <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> and vary {{the intensity of the}} light through gas flow. Arrayed {{on the side of the}} {{proscenium arch}} were gas-lit border lamps, equipped with tin reflectors that cast light backstage and onto the borders. Each border lamp was in a wire cage intended to keep the canvas borders at least a foot (...) away from the gas lamps within. Personnel were forbidden to ignite gaslights with matches or smoke anywhere on the stage.|$|E
60|$|And then I got {{a sample}} of Mulligan Jacobs. The venom of hatred I had already seen in his face was as nothing {{compared}} with what now was manifested. I had a feeling that, like stroking a cat in cold weather, did I touch his face it would crackle <b>electric</b> <b>sparks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, Hoppe’s {{research}} group {{was able to}} generate XeF2 {{in the form of}} transparent crystals in early 1962. To do so, they let <b>electric</b> <b>sparks</b> impact on xenon-fluorine mixtures. Neil Bartlett tried a similar experiment {{for the first time in}} the USA on August 2, 1962. After a few days, he gained xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4.|$|R
50|$|The {{plasma state}} is often misunderstood, {{but it is}} {{actually}} quite common on Earth, {{and the majority of}} people observe it on a regular basis without even realizing it.

2500|$|Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters: In 1887 Austro-Hungarian {{scientist}} Robert von Sterneck {{developed a}} small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled vacuum tank {{to eliminate the}} effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a [...] "half-second pendulum," [...] having a period close to one second, about 25cm long. [...] The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting {{the image of an}} <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted {{at the top of the}} pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890, were used extensively for surveys into the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, {{there is always}} the possibility that a small <b>electric</b> <b>spark</b> will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as a}} kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, it may not be a Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the proper reason it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to saying that you cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E
