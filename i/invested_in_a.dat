5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with an early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
5|$|In 1599, a {{partnership}} {{of members of}} the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> share of the parish tithes in Stratford.|$|E

5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|While Heman {{remained}} in Salisbury, where {{he ran a}} general store {{until his death in}} 1778, Allen's movements {{over the next few years}} are poorly documented. He is known to have been living in Northampton, Massachusetts in the spring of 1766, where his son Joseph was born, and where he <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lead mine. He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities; while no official reason is known, biographer Michael Bellesiles suggests that religious differences and Allen's tendency to be disruptive may have played a role in his departure. He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby Sheffield, Massachusetts with his younger brother Zimri. It is likely that his first visits to the New Hampshire Grants occurred during these years. While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years, Allen was often absent for extended periods.|$|E

5|$|A {{version for}} PC was {{developed}} by Square's Costa Mesa offices. Square <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> PC version so they could reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled {{by a team of}} 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but including help from Tokyo. Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation's software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.|$|E
5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the {{brother-in-law}} of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
