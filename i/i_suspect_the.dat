25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
500|$|Martin {{offered the}} {{following}} hint {{as to how}} the series would conclude during a Q at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. [...] "I'm {{not going to tell you}} how I'm going to end my book, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> mate of {{his opinion}} of the captain long before he {{expressed}} it. He was, I say, a taciturn man, but one day speech broke through him. He had been {{sitting at the table}} with his arms folded on it, musing drearily, pipe in mouth, and the voice of the captain drifted down from above.|$|R
60|$|The London Daily News of December 11, 1868, {{contained}} the following paragraph, which emanated, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> from <b>the</b> pen of Prof. R. A. Proctor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. They are queer people. <b>The</b> mamma, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> is <b>the</b> {{least bit}} of an adventuress. Heaven knows what the {{daughter}} is." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{setting is}} wonderful, Ms. Carl {{describes}} {{the village of}} Somerstowe and the English climate so well that this reader {{felt as if she}} were viewing a film. The characters, both major as well as minor, come to life clearly with all their traits, quirks, and foibles helping the reader understand some of their actions. The mystery kept me guessing until the last few chapters where I had an [...] "AHA! moment" [...] just as <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> author intended.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} January, Franklin, Back and Hepburn {{formed an}} advance party to {{head through the}} pine forests to Fort Chipewyan, to hire voyageurs and arrange supplies for the next leg of the expedition. Led by Canadian guides, the Britons, who had no experience of the harsh Canadian winters, found the journey extremely arduous. The constant and extreme cold froze their tea almost immediately after it had been poured, {{as well as the}} mercury in their thermometers. Without tents, they were grateful for snowfall, as it provided an extra layer of insulation over their blankets. Franklin would later write that the journey brought [...] "a great inter-mixture of agreeable and disagreeable circumstances. Could the amount of each be balanced, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> latter would much preponderate." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1945 to 1973, Eden was Chancellor of the University of Birmingham, England. In a {{television}} interview in 1966 he called on the United States to halt its bombing of North Vietnam to concentrate on developing a peace plan [...] "that might conceivably be acceptable to Hanoi." [...] The bombing of North Vietnam, he argued, would never settle the conflict in South Vietnam. [...] "On the contrary," [...] he declared, [...] "bombing creates a sort of David and Goliath complex in any country that has to suffer—as we had to, and as <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> Germans had to, in the last war." [...] Eden sat for extensive interviews for the famed multi-part Thames Television production, The World at War, which was first broadcast in 1973. He also featured frequently in Marcel Ophüls' 1969 documentary Le chagrin et la pitié, discussing the occupation of France in a wider geopolitical context. He spoke impeccable, if accented, French.|$|E
60|$|I was amazed. Incredulous, too. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> {{fellow of}} {{gratuitous}} impertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I {{would see him}} and Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me to my room with no more of his nonsense. He produced then a key from somewhere {{and led the way}} out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} the sixth inning that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> Rube of weakening. For that matter he had not pitched {{anything}} resembling his usual brand of baseball. But the Rube had developed into such a wonder in the box that it took time for his let-down to dawn upon me. Also it took a tip from Raddy, who sat {{with me on the}} bench.|$|R
60|$|LADY SNEERWELL. I'm not {{disappointed}} in Snake, <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> fellow to have virtue {{enough to be}} faithful even to his own Villany.|$|R
60|$|Mill. I wish it prove so; for <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> knight {{can neither}} play nor sing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This last {{conversation}} was some three weeks ago. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> principal parties settled {{it on that}} snowy Twelfth-day--' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Thurid ceased speaking, to enhance, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>the</b> {{dramatic}} effect of his disclosure. Then he resumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mind my {{being a little}} personal, I'd better own that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> fact you mention, and it puzzled me," [...] Nasmyth replied. [...] "You see, when I first met you at the Empress Hotel, in Victoria, you were dressed and talked like the usual prosperous {{business}} man. Trafford, who introduced us, said {{that you had a}} good deal of money in some of the Yukon mines." ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Well, {{perhaps it}} saves unpleasantness to say so. But for my part, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>the</b> tables of {{consanguinity}} {{have a natural}} basis in a natural repugnance [he rises].|$|R
5000|$|According to {{reviewer}} Jeb Branin, [...] "I {{was writing}} for a zine in Canada called Northern Metal that reviewed the new LP The Return Of Martha Splatterhead {{giving it a}} 0.0 rating and absolutely crucifying it in the review. It is the only 0.0 review I remember ever seeing in Northern Metal. They hated it so much I knew I had to buy it. As <b>I</b> <b>suspected,</b> <b>the</b> album was a masterpiece of hardcore hysteria." ...|$|R
60|$|Proof, {{as indeed}} all else is, that Shakespeare never {{intended}} {{us to see}} the King with Hamlet’s eyes; though, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>the</b> managers have long done so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must ask}} you to explain," [...] said he. [...] "Do you mean to turn me out into the rain? My good man, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> choice is mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, indeed, {{might have}} been useful," [...] said Jack, {{examining}} it, [...] "if we had any powder; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> bow and the sling will prove more serviceable." ...|$|E
60|$|B. B. [continuing] <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> typhoid: <b>the</b> head gardener's boy had it; so I {{just called}} at St Anne's {{one day and}} got a tube of your very {{excellent}} serum. You were out, unfortunately.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word. I {{guessed it}} from her letters, for lately she says nothing about Mac, and {{before there was a}} good deal, so <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> what <b>the</b> silence meant and asked no questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' said Charles, {{when all}} {{were out of}} hearing but his mother; 'and <b>I</b> shrewdly <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> comfort would be still greater if it was Sir Guy Morville who was coming.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{dislike the}} name of Willoughby, then, and intend to drop it, in future--I have remarked that you sign {{yourself}} only 'Maud,' in your last letters--never before, however, did <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, I {{think they}} are here still," [...] said Bernard. [...] "My friend Wright has gone away {{for a week or}} two, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> ladies are simply staying at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allons, toujours des questions!" [...] says mademoiselle, {{with a shrug}} of {{her pretty}} shoulders. (Florac has {{recommended}} her to us, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> little Chevalier has himself an eye upon this pretty Mademoiselle de Blois.) ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{it was as}} <b>I</b> <b>suspected.</b> <b>The</b> Campaigner ruled {{over this}} family, and added to all their distresses by her {{intolerable}} presence and tyranny. [...] "Why, sir," [...] I ventured to ask, [...] "if, as I gather from you--and I remember," [...] I added with a laugh, [...] "certain battles-royal which Clive described to me in old days--if you and the Campai--Mrs. Mackenzie do not agree, why should she continue to live with you, when you would all be so much happier apart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The señor is {{provided}} with money,” Gomez said. “I did not myself {{know that he was}} an Englishman, though <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> from <b>the</b> manner in which I was hired that he had trouble with the Spaniards.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] said Henry, {{closing the}} book he had just opened; [...] "if <b>I</b> had <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> letter of {{containing}} anything unwelcome, I should have given it with very different feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is an {{extraordinary}} excitement about Paris," [...] he wrote. [...] "A levity. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> gypsum in the subsoil--some as yet undescribed radiations. Suddenly the world looks brightly cynical.... None of those tear-compelling German emanations....|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and thanks}} to Duke William that either Louis or Alan are not exiles still. Now we shall see whose {{gratitude}} is worth most, the Frank's or the Breton's. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> Norman valour {{will be the best}} to trust to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So peace reigned, and as I {{settled the}} tray, I heard cook say in her balmiest tone, for <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> cake and tea lay heavy on her conscience, 'The {{mistress}} is very poorly, and Miss takes nice care of her, the dear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{hopefully}} in {{love with}} your father," [...] Lady Cynthia confessed. [...] "It has been coming {{on for a long}} time. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> it <b>the</b> first time I ever met him. Now I am absolutely certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Señora," [...] I protested, with dignity, [...] "I {{assure you}} on the word of honour of an Englishman, <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> <b>the</b> man had any {{intention}} of escaping. I am very angry it has happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{the nature}} of <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> offense (in particular, does it involve {{evidence}} easily destroyed? <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> dangerous?) ...|$|R
