His personal contentment, (at {{the top of his}} profession, and [...] "an unashamed beneficiary of the fruits of late capitalism") provides a hopeful side to the book, instead of the unhappiness in contemporary fiction. McEwan's previous novels highlighted the fragility of modern fulfilled life, seemingly minor incidents dramatically upsetting existence. Saturday returns to a theme explored in Atonement, which plotted the disruption of a lie to a middle-class family, and in The Child in Time, where a small child is kidnapped during a day's shopping. This theme is continued in Saturday, a [...] "tautly wound tour-de-force" [...] set in a world where terrorism, war and politics make the news headlines, but the protagonist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> out this life until he [...] "collides with another fate". In Saturday Perowne's medical knowledge captures the delicate state of humanity better than novelists' imaginations: his acquaintance with death and neurological perspective better capture human frailty.|$|E

Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a life of hard work and all he has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E

At that time, ten episodes revolving around the character had aired. Canning wrote that the episode [...] "was {{a lot of fun}} as it put Bob in an unexpected situation with the Simpsons, interacting more with Homer than with Bart." [...] He added that the episode [...] "is also memorable for having Homer's attempted murderer turn out to be Frank Grimes Jr., son of Frank 'Grimey' Grimes. This was a nice reference to 'Homer's Enemy' and was a rare instance where the series carried through some continuity." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "Over the years, we’ve gotten many a great Sideshow Bob episode, so this one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to steep competition. While not a bad show, 'Louse' fails {{to live up to its}} predecessors. It does throw out some good moments, and it’s fine by Season 14 standards, but it doesn’t qualify as a Sideshow Bob classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Global citizenship, in some contexts, may {{refer to}} a brand of ethics or {{political}} philosophy {{in which it is}} proposed that the core social, political, economic and environmental realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens. [...] It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that [...] "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, cosmopolites)" [...] {{in response to a question}} about his place of origin. A Sanskrit term, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, has the meaning of [...] "the world is one family". [...] The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the Mahopanishad VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe).
