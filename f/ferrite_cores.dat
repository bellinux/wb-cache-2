40|$|The key of {{wireless}} power transfer technology rests on finding the most suitable means to improve {{the efficiency of the}} system. The {{wireless power transfer}} system applied in implantable medical devices can reduce the patients’ physical and economic burden because it will achieve charging in vitro. For a deep brain stimulator, in this paper, the transmitter coil is designed and optimized. According to the previous research results, the coils with <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> can improve the performance of the wireless power transfer system. Compared with the normal <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> the stepped core can produce more uniform magnetic flux density. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) is used to analyze the system. The simulation results indicate that the core loss generated in the optimal stepped <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> can reduce about 10 % compared with the normal <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> and the efficiency of the wireless power transfer system can be increased significantly...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{logic is}} digital logic made using the non linear {{properties}} of wound <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b> Magnetic logic represents 0 and 1 by magnetising cores clockwise or anticlockwise.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the other}} {{protocols}} break the ground loop at data baud rate frequency by fitting small <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> around the connecting cables near each end, and/or just inside the equipment boundary. These form a common-mode choke which inhibit unbalanced current flow, without affecting the differential signal. This technique is equally valid for coaxial interconnects, and many camcorders have <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> fitted to some of their auxiliary cables such as DC charging and external audio input, to break the high frequency current flow if the user inadvertently creates a ground loop when connecting external equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The NCR 315 is microprogrammed {{with hand}} wired <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> (a ROM) pulsed by a {{sequencer}} with conditional execution. Wires routed through the cores {{are enabled for}} various data and logic elements in the processor.|$|E
40|$|In {{framework}} of methods used in nonlinear optics the output voltage of toroid transformer with soft <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> is calculated. It is shown that {{apart from the}} component on fundamental frequency, it contains also harmonics of odd order. The strongest nonlinearities {{are those of the}} third and fifth order. An experimental verification on real transformer with MnZn <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> confirms the statements developed...|$|R
5000|$|External core lamps are {{basically}} fluorescent lamps with magnetic cores {{wrapped around a}} part of the discharge tube. The core is usually made of ferrite, a ceramic material containing iron oxide and other metals. In external core lamps, high frequency energy from a special power supply called an electronic ballast is sent through wires that are wrapped in a coil around a toroidal <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> placed around the outside of a portion of the glass tube, creating a high frequency magnetic field within the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b> Since the magnetic permeability of the ferrite is hundreds or thousands of times higher than that of the surrounding air or glass, and the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> provides a closed path for the magnetic field, virtually all of the magnetic field is contained inside the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b> As shown in Faraday's law of induction, the time varying magnetic field in the core will generate a time varying electric voltage in any closed path that encloses the time varying magnetic field. The discharge tube forms one such closed path around the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> and in that manner the time varying magnetic field in the core generates a time varying electric field in the discharge tube, There is no need for the magnetic field to penetrate the discharge tube. The electric field generated by the time varying magnetic field drives the mercury-rare gas discharge in the same way the discharge is driven by the electric field in a conventional fluorescent lamp. The primary winding on the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> the core, and the discharge form a transformer, with the discharge being a one-turn secondary on that transformer.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic, or <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> data {{retention}} {{is dependent on}} the magnetic properties of iron and its compounds.|$|R
50|$|Radio {{frequency}} chokes (RFC) {{often have}} iron powder or <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b> They are often wound in complex patterns (basket winding) to reduce self-capacitance and proximity effect losses. Chokes for even higher frequencies have non-magnetic cores and low inductance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> {{used for}} signals have {{a range of}} {{applications}} from 1 kHz to many MHz, perhaps as much as 300 MHz, and have found their main application in electronics, such as in AM Radios and RFID tags.|$|E
50|$|Vector magnetometers {{are subject}} to {{temperature}} drift and the dimensional instability of the <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b> They also require levelling to obtain component information, unlike total field (scalar) instruments. For these reasons {{they are no longer}} used for mineral exploration.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{technique}} of local AC magnetic field, temperature and velocity measurements {{in the gap}} between electromagnetic induction pump (EMIP) channel and inductor using a single <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> coil is discussed. Described method has several important advantages: high signal/noise ratio due to <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> small size of a sensor, three parameter measurement, non-intrusiveness, low cost etc. However, some significant limitations should be also considered: saturation of <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> with relatively low fields and temperature dependence on magnetic permeability characteristic of ferrite material. Finally, this perspective measurement method was tested in University of Latvia (UL) and implemented in measurement system of TESLA-EMP loop in Institute of Physics of University of Latvia (IPUL). Some relevant results of these experiments are presented...|$|R
50|$|Ferrite {{transformers}} are {{not used}} as power transformers at mains frequency since laminated iron cores cost less than an equivalent <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>core</b> power {{transformers}} {{are widely}} used in switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs). The powder core enables high-frequency operation, and hence much smaller size-to-power ratio than laminated-iron transformers.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{distinguishing}} factor between high-quality and low-quality filters {{is the use}} of transistors in high-quality (and more expensive) active filters, {{in addition}} to the usual components like capacitors, resistors, and <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores,</b> while the low-quality passive filters lack transistors.|$|E
50|$|Early {{computer}} memories {{stored data}} in the residual magnetic fields of hard <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores,</b> which were assembled into arrays of core memory. Ferrite powders {{are used in the}} coatings of magnetic recording tapes. One such type of material is iron (III) oxide.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, acousto-magnetic {{systems were}} covered by now-expired patents held by Sensormatic. WG Security Products, Inc. won a court battle against Sensormatic {{clarifying}} that WG Security Products acousto-magnetic systems did not infringe any Sensormatic patents.Disposable acousto-magnetic tags require special metal alloys; non-disposable ones require more expensive <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cables for {{connection}} of computer peripherals {{often have a}} ferrite bead. The cable {{can be used to}} increase the inductance also repeatedly passed through a <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{wideband}} common-mode {{noise filter}} for switching power supplies has been developed. The filter consisted of an Mn-Zn <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> and a copper/polyimide tape wound coil. The tape wound coil had two signal lines, two ground lines, and a polyimide dielectric film. The filter exhibited a common-mode rejection of over 30 dB {{in the wide}} frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz. The wideband common-mode filtering {{was due to the}} high-frequency magnetic loss of the Mn-Zn <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> and the optimum ground point selection for the ground lines. © 2005 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|Other names include loopstick antenna, ferrod, and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} ferrite rod aerial, particularly used by Philips where the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|R
50|$|There are {{two broad}} {{applications}} for <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> which differ {{in size and}} frequency of operation: signal transformers, which are of small size and higher frequencies, and power transformers, which are of large size and lower frequencies. Cores can also be classified by shape, such as toroidal cores, shell cores or cylindrical cores.|$|E
50|$|The Honeywell 800 and 1800 had a {{main memory}} and a control memory, both using <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b> The main memory had between 4 and 16 banks, {{depending}} on customer requirements. Each bank contained 2048 words of 48 bits each. The {{actual number of}} banks in an individual installation {{had to be a}} multiple of 4.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> {{are used}} in {{electronic}} inductors, transformers, and electromagnets where the high electrical resistance of the ferrite leads to very low eddy current losses. They are commonly seen as a lump in a computer cable, called a ferrite bead, which helps to prevent high frequency electrical noise (radio frequency interference) from exiting or entering the equipment.|$|E
50|$|A Trigger {{transformer}} is a small, usually <b>ferrite</b> <b>cored</b> transformer used in applications {{requiring a}} high voltage pulse, typically to start ionization {{of a gas}} to allow a current to pass.|$|R
50|$|The SM-series also {{included}} the SM-3, without floating point processing, similar to DEC's PDP 11/40 and 11/34 models. In early production, <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> memory was used. It operated at 200,000 operations per second.|$|R
50|$|RF cabling, usually coaxial, is {{also often}} {{equipped}} with a <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> often a fairly large toroid, through which the cable can be wound perhaps 10 times to add a useful amount of common mode inductance.|$|R
50|$|Core {{memory was}} {{a matrix of}} laced <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores.</b> Because {{transistors}} were relatively slow at that time, Hounsfield also used magnetic logic units {{to speed up the}} operation of the machine to achieve a processing power comparable with a valve/tube computer. These logic units consisted of a single ferrite ring (toroid), with up to fifteen connections to it.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an entire}} {{industry}} based on regulatory compliance: manufacturers shipping a product {{to a foreign}} country must comply with each country's limitations on leakage of interfering signals. For example, in Germany the TÜV issues regulatory rules for unintentional radiators. The big cylindrical bumps on the cable to monitors and laptop chargers are <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> which reduce undesired signals.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{threading}} individual <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> on wires, plated wire memory used a grid {{of wires}} coated with {{a thin layer of}} iron-nickel alloy (called permalloy). The magnetic field normally stored in the ferrite core was instead stored on the wire itself. Operation was generally similar to core, but could also be built with a non-destructive read that did not require refreshing.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrite (loopstick) - These {{are used}} as the {{receiving}} antenna in most consumer AM radios operating in the medium wave broadcast band (and lower frequencies), a notable exception being car radios. Wire is coiled around a <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> which greatly increases the coil's inductance. Radiation pattern is maximum at directions perpendicular to the ferrite rod. The null direction of <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> antennas are bi-directional and sharper than the maximal directionality. This often makes the null direction more useful than the maximal directionality because the null direction {{can be used to}} reject unwanted signals from interferring stations, sometimes allowing reception from stations with weaker signals than interferring stations.|$|R
50|$|PC12 by Artronix was a {{minicomputer}} {{built with}} TTL7400 technology and <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> memory.
