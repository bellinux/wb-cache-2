25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a link between the}} grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training to really get the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E
