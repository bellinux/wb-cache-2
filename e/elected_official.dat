5|$|Béla II's army invaded Bosnia in 1136, {{which he}} commemorated by {{adopting}} the title King of Rama after a small river. The following year, the King appointed Ladislaus Duke of Bosnia at an {{assembly of the}} prelates and barons in Esztergom. However, Ladislaus never personally ruled the territory and administration was overseen by the Ban, who was either an appointed or an <b>elected</b> <b>official.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> in Burbank, California.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American {{politician}} {{and the first}} openly gay <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> {{in the history of}} California, where {{he was elected to the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a City Controller {{to sit at}} {{the head}} of an {{independent}} auditing department. The Controller approves all payments made out of the city treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently <b>elected</b> <b>official,</b> the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the reform coalition of 1951.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden's {{career as}} an <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> began in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he {{represented}} Logan County from 1811 to 1817. After the 1811 legislative session, he volunteered as an aide to General Samuel Hopkins in an expedition against the Indians. On {{the outbreak of the}} War of 1812, Kentucky governor Charles Scott appointed him as an aide-de-camp for the First Kentucky Militia. In 1813, he became an aide-de-camp to Governor Isaac Shelby, serving at the Battle of the Thames in Canada. Following the war, the governor issued him a special commendation for faithfulness in carrying out his orders. He then resumed his law practice in Russellville.|$|E

Under the state constitution, this change will be effective for <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> {{at the beginning of their}} next term of office.|$|R
40|$|Although citizen-initiated {{contacting}} {{of municipal}} bureau-crats {{has been the}} subject of extensive research over the past quarter century, there has been relatively little research on the contacting of municipal <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> or on why citizens might contact <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> instead of appointed administrators. This research explores that question by using survey data on citizen-initiated contacts with various <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> and appointed administrators in Atlanta, Georgia. The findings suggest a several-part answer: First, citizens—in Atlanta anyway—usually prefer to contact city departments directly rather than through their <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> presumably because most contacts involve concerns about municipal services that a department must even-tually address. Second, citizens contact both departments and <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> for many of the same reasons; the most promi-nent reason is perceived problems with services. Third, the con-tacting of <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> appears to be influenced by frustration with the bureaucracy (i. e., dissatisfaction with bureaucratic help-fulness when the bureaucracy is contacted) and also by ignorance of the bureaucracy (i. e., not knowing who to contact there). We conclude this article with a discussion of the possible implications of the findings for public administrators. Citizen-initiated contacting of municipal bureaucrats—when individuals contact government personnel with requests for services or with complaints—{{has been the subject}} of extensive research over the past quarter century (see, for example, Serra 1995; Sharp 1986; Jones et al. 1977). Anecdotal evidence sug-gests that citizens often instead take those same requests and complaints to municipal <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> but there is little evi-dence that explains why citizens might choose <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> over appointed administrators (as exceptions, see Clingermaye...|$|R
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time <b>elected</b> <b>official,</b> Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's salary as {{governor}}, {{which was}} the highest for an <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E
5|$|June 28, 2012: In {{the case}} of United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005's criminalization of the making of false claims of having been awarded a {{military}} medal, decoration, or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.

5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} {{consolidation of}} {{city and county}} offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently <b>elected</b> <b>official.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Berrios {{combined}} {{government sector}} jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, {{and private sector}} proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His political campaign strategies included ballot access challenges to potential opponents.

In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office.|$|E

[...] Benjamin Page proposes mediated deliberation be a [...] "division of labor" [...] with the idea of using the media to deliver information between the <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> and the public because modern problems make it impossible to rely on the <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> to deliberate for the public.

40|$|Every ten years, {{the borders}} of congressional and state {{legislative}} districts are redrawn.

5|$|Scherger {{graduated}} from Andover in December 1935 {{and over the}} next year completed courses at the RAF's School of Air Navigation and Central Flying School. Returning to Australia, he resumed his position as CFI at Point Cook in May 1937. At the direction of the Federal government, he was responsible for training the Treasurer, Richard Casey, to fly; the use of Air Force facilities for his own benefit by an <b>elected</b> <b>official</b> led to adverse publicity when it was revealed by the media. In September 1937, Scherger test flew the North American NA-16 at Laverton; the evaluation program led to the design being adapted as the CAC Wirraway the following year. He was appointed Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in January 1938, and promoted to wing commander in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an <b>elected</b> <b>official,</b> had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an <b>elected</b> <b>official.</b> Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
