40|$|An {{incremental}} format <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> {{model was}} presented {{to take account of}} the development <b>of</b> concrete <b>creep</b> due to loading at different ages. The formulation was attained by introducing a horizontal parallel assumption <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> curves and combining it with the vertical parallel <b>creep</b> curve <b>of</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> method to remedy the disadvantage of the rate <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> method that significantly underestimates the amount <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> strain, regardless <b>of</b> its simple format. Two creep curves were combined by introducing an ageing parameter whose value was obtained from two sets of time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens.

TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the influence <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and creep feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), creep feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), creep feeder design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties <b>of</b> the <b>creep</b> feed (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and creep diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, creep feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks <b>of</b> age. <b>Creep</b> feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, creep feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. Creep feed consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed creep feed (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume creep feed) and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction {{of the severity of}} post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>creep</b> diet, and the duration <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> feeding. The proportion <b>of</b> eaters <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> feed in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary creep feeder with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest creep feed disappearance. Creep diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion <b>of</b> pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the creep feed did not affect creep feed consumption and the proportion <b>of</b> pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. Therefore, creep feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|R
