5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|With Jivevaneng decided, the Australians turned {{advancing}} west towards Sattelberg. The {{force that}} {{was chosen for}} this was the recently arrived 26th Brigade, which would be supported by nine Matildas of the 1st Tank Battalion. At the same time, the 4th Brigade, a Militia formation detached from the 5th Division, was brought up to relieve the 26th Brigade of garrison duties around Finschhafen. The tanks moved up to Jivevaneng {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> their noise {{in an effort to keep}} their presence secret until the start of the advance. On 16 November, the 2/48th Infantry Battalion, supported by the artillery of the 2/12th Field Regiment and the machine guns of the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, captured Green Ridge overlooking the track, which was the designated forming-up point for the advance on Sattelberg, which began the following day.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} calm, swift Parliament foundered on {{the rocks}} of {{religious}} conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, {{one of the few}} remaining Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> speeches by opponents. Coke and Cecil, the government's two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking until the end of the Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no more action was taken on the two Puritan bills.|$|E
25|$|On the day, about 75 protesters {{arrived by}} coach from {{northern}} England.

25|$|One common {{complaint}} about NBA coverage on ABC {{is the use}} of unconventional camera angles, including the Floorcam and Skycam angles, used by the network throughout its coverage. Other complaints are of camera angles that appear too far away, colors that seem faded and dull, and the quieting of crowd noise so that announcers can be heard clearly (by contrast to NBC, which allowed crowd noise to sometimes <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> their announcers).|$|E
25|$|The IWW was {{condemned}} by {{politicians and the}} press, who saw them {{as a threat to}} the market systems as well as an effort to monopolize labor at a time when efforts to monopolize industries were being fought as anti-market.

Members were often arrested and sometimes killed for making public speeches, but this persecution only inspired activism.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization {{warns that}} {{increasing}} use of headphones and earphones puts 1.1billion teenagers and young adults at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe use of personal audio devices.

25|$|In 2015, the {{atmosphere}} among {{the community of}} Brussels, Belgium was tense when the city was put under the highest level state of emergency immediately following the Paris attacks, however internet cats were able to cut the tension by taking over the Twitter feed #BrusselsLockdown. The feed was designed to discuss operational details of terrorist raids, but when police asked for a social media blackout the hashtag was overwhelmed by internet users posting pictures of cats to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> serious discussion and prevent terrorists from gaining any useful information. The use of cat images is {{a reference to the}} Level 4 state of emergency: the French word for the number 4, quatre, is pronounced similarly to the word cat in English.|$|E

Stepeck searched Los Angeles and was unable to find a suitable bed. He had to order the bed from a specialized furniture store in San Francisco. Mulder's paycheck and envelope were created after several calls to the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The checks were made to be as realistic as possible without looking too convincing. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, the police cruisers were all turned off, because the combined noise of the cars would <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> dialogue.

500|$|There {{was just}} enough time before nightfall to storm the {{position}} on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but {{not enough time to}} develop simultaneous attacks from other sides. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people." ...|$|E

The band agreed and met with an American aid worker named Bill Carter, who acted as the station's foreign associate, due to Serbian travel restrictions. Carter described his experiences in Sarajevo helping Bosnians while surviving the dangerous living conditions. Lead vocalist Bono was unnerved to hear that those living in makeshift bomb shelters in the city played music, including U2's, at loud volumes to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the sound of explosions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned {{the theme of the}} Zooropa tour leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring the Bosnians' plight, Carter sought Bono's help.
