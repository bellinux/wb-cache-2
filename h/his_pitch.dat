5|$|Both were {{produced}} at Cartoon Network Studios. Before landing his own show, Browngardt {{had worked at}} Augenblick Studios and MTV, {{as well as on}} individual programs, such as Futurama, The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Chowder. Browngardt's work on the lattermost series began when its creator C.H. Greenblatt looked through one of <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> bibles that he left at the studio.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} the CBS {{offices to}} make <b>his</b> <b>pitch,</b> he was {{involved}} in a car accident. At the auto body shop, he met Liz, who later became his second wife. Though CBS passed on Tee-Witt, its designs served as the basis for Bakshi's 1977 film Wizards. While leaving the network offices, he learned that Paramount Pictures had recently fired Shamus Culhane, the head of its animation division. Bakshi met with Burt Hampft, a lawyer for the studio, and was hired to replace Culhane.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did {{make it into the}} series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E

5|$|Cameron wanted <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that <b>his</b> <b>pitch,</b> described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} {{professional}} stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He {{was billed as}} Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing {{in order to make}} <b>his</b> <b>pitch.</b> In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.|$|E

5|$|The first Halloween comic was {{published}} by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled Halloween, {{it was intended to}} be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20. These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to Halloween H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on <b>his</b> <b>pitch,</b> Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.|$|E
25|$|Maddux's low walk totals {{also kept}} <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> counts down, {{enabling}} {{him to go}} deeper into games. In 31 starts, Maddux threw 9 innings with 100 or fewer pitches. Ten of those starts were under 90 pitches, including a 76-pitch complete game in July 1997, the most efficient start by any pitcher since 1979.|$|E
25|$|Povenmire was {{initially}} worried {{that his work}} on Family Guy (an adult show known for its lowbrow humor) would concern Disney, which markets primarily towards families. However, the Disney Channel's Senior Vice President of Original Series, Adam Bonnett, was a Family Guy fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> well.|$|E
5000|$|Corbin {{is listed}} at 6 ft and [...] <b>His</b> <b>pitching</b> {{repertoire}} contains a fastball that averages 92 mph, occasionally topping out at 95 miles and hour. <b>His</b> secondary <b>pitches</b> include a changeup, which he throws between 81 mph and 82 mph and a slider, which he throws between 78 mph and 79 mph, and considered <b>his</b> best <b>pitch</b> {{coming out of}} college.|$|R
50|$|Cobb throws four pitches: a four-seam fastball and sinker {{averaging}} about 93 mph, a knuckle {{curve in}} the low 80s, and a splitter in the high 80s. More than half of <b>his</b> <b>pitches</b> with 2 strikes are splitters. He tends to throw more four-seamers and splitters to right-handed hitters, but batters {{from both sides of}} the plate see a fair amount of all of <b>his</b> <b>pitches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sanches relies {{mostly on}} four <b>pitches.</b> <b>His</b> primary <b>pitch</b> is a four-seam fastball {{in the upper}} 80s, which he uses for about half <b>his</b> <b>pitches.</b> Against left-handed hitters, he relies heavily on a forkball and {{somewhat}} less on a two-seam fastball to round out his repertoire. Against right-handed hitters, Sanches uses a slider as <b>his</b> main off-speed <b>pitch,</b> and he also throws the forkball to righties. On rare occasions, Sanches throws a mid-70s curveball.|$|R

25|$|Warner {{executive}} Bill Gerber {{showed the}} script to Michael Nathanson, CEO of New Regency Productions, {{which had a}} deal with the studio. Nathanson loved it, but they had to get the approval from the owner of New Regency, Arnon Milchan. Hanson prepared a presentation that consisted of 15 vintage postcards and pictures of L.A. mounted on posterboards, and made <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> to Milchan. The pictures consisted of orange groves, beaches, tract homes in the San Fernando Valley, and the opening of the Hollywood Freeway to symbolize the image of prosperity sold to the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{composing}} the opera, Mozart evidently kept in {{mind the}} skills of the singers intended for the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary comic actors asked to sing for the occasion. Thus, the vocal lines for Papageno—sung by Schikaneder himself—and Monostatos (Johann Joseph Nouseul) are often stated first in the strings so the singer can find <b>his</b> <b>pitch,</b> and are frequently doubled by instruments. In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer, who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is famous for its difficulty. In ensembles, Mozart skillfully combined voices of different ability levels.|$|E
50|$|Lilly is a finesse pitcher, as {{he lacks}} elite {{velocity}} with <b>his</b> <b>pitches</b> but relies on above-average control and movement, {{as well as}} the ability to throw a variety of pitches. He throws two fastballs—a four-seamer and a two-seamer in the 86-90 mph range—and two breaking balls, a slider and a big, slow curveball. He also features a changeup. He uses the slider more against left-handed batters and <b>his</b> other off-speed <b>pitches</b> more against right-handed batters. <b>His</b> <b>pitching</b> motion uses a straight-over-the-top delivery.|$|R
50|$|The Tokyo Big6 Baseball League was {{dominated}} by Waseda University and Keio University, and the Hosei University team solely depended upon Wakabayashi's pitching to carry the team. He was unsuccessful {{in his first year}} due to differences between Japanese and American baseball, but gradually improved to win the league championship in Autumn, 1930. He injured <b>his</b> <b>pitching</b> arm in 1931, and had to switch to a side arm release to continue pitching. He was no longer able to throw fastballs, but improved <b>his</b> breaking <b>pitches</b> and control to continue <b>his</b> <b>pitching</b> success.|$|R

25|$|In May 2011, Westwood contested {{a playoff}} at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman {{and at the}} time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much backspin on <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, Kines {{entered a}} pitch in a one-minute film {{competition}} sponsored by stock photo company Getty Images. <b>His</b> <b>pitch,</b> a bittersweet sci fi-tinged tone poem entitled The Closest Thing to Time Travel, {{was selected as}} one of only 30 pitches (out of over 240 entries) to be turned into short films using Getty stock footage material. In early 2006 Kines finished his film, and when the competition was {{open to the public}} for final voting, The Closest Thing to Time Travel won Kines the Grand Prize of $10,000 and trips to New York City, Chicago, and Bozeman, Montana, where Kines was a speaker at HATCHfest.|$|E
25|$|After being outrighted by the Rangers, McCarthy {{signed as}} a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on December 14, 2010 for one year and $1 million. As part of the {{starting}} pitcher rotation for the Athletics in 2011, McCarthy strengthened his mechanics and had his most productive major league season, pitching twenty-five games, five complete. He adapted <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> repertoire to emphasize two-seam fastballs and cutters, which helped increase his ground-ball percentage and lower his home-run rate while developing control and limiting walks allowed. McCarthy finished the year with the lowest FIP among American League starters. He signed a one-year contract worth $4.275million with the Athletics for the 2012 season, avoiding salary arbitration.|$|E

25|$|At the 2013 U.S. Open, Mickelson {{entered the}} final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days, but he started {{the final round}} by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys {{to fall out of}} the lead. He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a {{misjudgment}} at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.|$|E
500|$|... "Springsteen" [...] {{features}} {{drums and}} a synthesizer, along with live instrumentation from the guitar and keyboard.

His double-disc album Life After Death, released 16 days later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts and was certified Diamond in 2000 by the Recording Industry Association of America, {{one of the few}} hip hop albums to receive this certification. Wallace was noted for his [...] "loose, easy flow", dark semi-autobiographical lyrics and storytelling abilities, sometimes changing <b>his</b> <b>pitch</b> on songs.
