This variant therefore held an advantage over Gresley’s design, as the Holcroft valve gear would be immune to variations <b>in</b> <b>valve</b> events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the conjugation levers when in heavy use.|$|E

40|$|We used broad-range PCR {{amplification}} and sequencing {{to detect}} and identify bacterial DNA <b>in</b> 156 <b>valves</b> of patients treated for infective endocarditis (IE). Bacterial DNA was found more frequently in patients who underwent valve replacement while on antibiotic treatment for IE (60 %) than in patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE (37 %; P = 0. 02). We found specific bacterial DNA <b>in</b> <b>valves</b> removed from 11 of 30 patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE. Six had no histological evidence of IE. The presence of DNA was significantly correlated {{with the presence of}} histologic lesions (P = 0. 001) and with the presence of bacteria detected by Gram staining (P < 0. 001). Bartonella and streptococci were detected for much longer after antibiotic treatment by PCR than other species (P = 0. 047 and 0. 04, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected for much shorter periods (P = 0. 02). The finding that bacterial DNA was more likely to be detected <b>in</b> <b>valves</b> of patients with active IE than in patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE shows that bacterial DNA is cleared slowly. There was no significant correlation between the duration of antibiotic therapy and the presence of bacterial DNA <b>in</b> <b>valves.</b> Since the persistence of bacterial DNA <b>in</b> <b>valves</b> does not necessarily indicate the persistence of viable bacteria, the detection of bacterial DNA <b>in</b> <b>valves</b> from IE patients should be interpreted with caution, in particular in those patients with a past history of treated IE...|$|R
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations <b>in</b> <b>valve</b> events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E

2500|$|Chronic rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. [...] The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result <b>in</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve molecular mimicry and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E
