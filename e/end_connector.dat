40|$|AbstractThe {{aspect ratio}} of {{submerged}} floating tunnel (SFT), i. e. the ratio of length to diameter, is usually as large as 102 to 103, which means the behavior of SFT would like a slender cylinder restrained by tethers. Although SFT is usually placed under the water surface at a certain depth, surface wave has important influence on its dynamic response due to the slenderness. This paper performs analyses on the fluid-structure interaction of SFT in wave field. Potential fluid theory is adopted to describe the wave field. Boundary element method is used to solve the interaction between SFT and surface wave. Wave potential {{is divided into three}} parts, including incident wave potential, diffraction wave potential and radiation wave potential. SFT is discretized into finite elements and its dynamic response is finally solved in frequency domain. As a case study, the values of design parameters for SFT prototype in Qiandao Lake are adopted.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulty}} connected {{to the use of}} dynamic methods for damage detection in structures lies on the small sensitivity of the dynamic parameters to damage. This is an intrinsic feature of structural diagnostics based on dynamic data and represents a source of important indeterminacy, such as the strong dependence of the results of damage detection techniques on the experimental errors and on the accuracy of the structural model that is cho-sen to interpret measurements. These facts are nowadays well known for simple structural systems, such as single beams or frames, but still are not completely clarified for more com-plicated structures. In this paper the results of an experimental investigation on the sensitivity of modal parameters of steel-concrete composite beams with partially damaged connection are presented and discussed. Dynamic tests were performed on two pairs of composite beams, whose connections have different linear densities, and four damage configurations for each beam were analyzed. Damage corresponds to a symmetric notch of increasing depth induced by saw-cutting one <b>end</b> <b>connector</b> of the composite beam. Natural frequencies and modal damping of the lower axial and flexural modes were assessed for the undamaged configura-tion and the four levels of damage.

40|$|Steel {{pallet rack}} (SPR) beam-to-column {{connections}} (BCCs) are largely responsible {{to avoid the}} sway failure of frames in the down-aisle direction. The overall geometry of beam end connectors commercially used in SPR BCCs is different and does not allow a generalized analytic approach {{for all types of}} beam end connectors; however, identifying the effects of the configuration, profile and sizes of the connection components could be the suitable approach for the practical design engineers in order to predict the generalized behavior of any SPR BCC. This paper describes the experimental behavior of SPR BCCs tested using a double cantilever test set-up. Eight sets of specimens were identified based on the variation in column thickness, beam depth and number of tabs in the beam <b>end</b> <b>connector</b> in order to investigate the most influential factors affecting the connection performance. Four tests were repeatedly performed for each set to bring uniformity to the results taking the total number of tests to thirty-two. The moment-rotation (M-Î¸) behavior, load-strain relationship, major failure modes and the influence of selected parameters on connection performance were investigated. A comparative study to calculate the connection stiffness was carried out using the initial stiffness method, the slope to half-ultimate moment method and the equal area method. In order to find out the more appropriate method, the mean stiffness of all the tested connections and the variance in values of mean stiffness according to all three methods were calculated. The calculation of connection stiffness by means of the initial stiffness method is considered to overestimate the values when compared to the other two methods. The equal area method provided more consistent values of stiffness and lowest variance in the data set as compared to the other two methods...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} <b>end</b> <b>connectors</b> for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of <b>end</b> <b>connectors</b> were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given. Further research and development needs to be conducted on these seven concepts with larger sample sizes and in varied conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming TSS- 1 experiment, theoretical calculations are made of radiated power from a conducting tethered satellite system.

Calculations are also made in the lower hybrid and whistler wave band. A larger impedance of about 13 ohm is found for the frequency range 5 - 50 kHz.
