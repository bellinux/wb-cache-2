40|$|On 11 March 2011, a M w ~ 9. 0 megathrust {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of Tohoku, triggering a catastrophic tsunami reaching heights of 10 m and more in some places and resulting in lots of casualties and destructions. It {{is one of a handful}} of catastrophic tsunamis having occurred during the last decade, following the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, and leading to the preparation of tsunami warning systems and evacuation plans all around the world. In the Atlantic Ocean, which has been struck by two certified transoceanic tsunamis over the past centuries (the 1755 "Lisbon" and 1929 Grand Banks events), a warning system is also under discussion, especially for what concerns potential tsunamigenic sources off Iberian Peninsula. In addition, the Lesser Antilles subduction zone is also potentially able to generate powerful megathrust ruptures as the 8 February 1843 M w ~ 8. 0 / 8. 5 earthquake, that could trigger devastating tsunamis propagating across the Northern Atlantic Ocean. The question is in which conditions these tsunamis could be able to reach the Oceanic Islands as well as the eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and what could be the estimated times to react and wave <b>heights</b> <b>to</b> expect? This <b>paper</b> attempts <b>to</b> answer those questions through the use of numerical modelings and recent research results about the Lesser Antilles ability to produce megathrust earthquakes...|$|R

30|$|In {{terms of}} coal seams with a {{thickness}} of 14 – 20  m, the LLTCC coal mining method has been proposed, {{which increases the}} coal cut <b>height</b> <b>to</b> 5  m, coal caving <b>height</b> <b>to</b> 15  m, and the total mining <b>height</b> <b>to</b> 20  m. The effect of different coal caving intervals and top-coal caving patterns on top-coal recovery has been investigated, which concludes that the recovery rate can be improved in long wall caving by applying the caving patterns of one-cut-one-caving and discharge in multi-round and multiple windows sequence alternately.|$|R

40|$|In {{point-to-point}} reaching movements, {{the trajectory}} of the fingertip along the horizontal plane is not completely straight but slightly curved sideward. The current paper examines whether this horizontal curvature is related <b>to</b> the <b>height</b> <b>to</b> which the finger is lifted. Previous research suggested that the <b>height</b> <b>to</b> which the hand is lifted might be a determinant of horizontal curvature. We asked participants to make point-to-point movements in three conditions: constrained movements (i. e., fingertip keeps contact with table top) over vertically curved surfaces that differed in height, constrained movements over a flat surface, and unconstrained movements (i. e., fingertip lifted from table top). In constrained movements, we found a strong relation between horizontal curvature and lifted height of the finger. Interestingly, for unconstrained movements, the relation between horizontal curvature and <b>height</b> <b>to</b> which the finger was lifted was weak. This demonstrates that the <b>height</b> <b>to</b> which the finger was lifted relates to horizontal curvature in some, but not in all conditions. This suggests that the <b>height</b> <b>to</b> which the hand is lifted should be included, in particular for constrained movements, when giving a full account of horizontal curvature in point-to-point movements...|$|R
