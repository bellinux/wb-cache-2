5000|$|Stationary <b>ropes,</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ropes</b> (spiral ropes, mostly full-locked) have {{to carry}} tensile forces and are {{therefore}} mainly loaded by static and fluctuating tensile stresses. Ropes used for suspension are often called cables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} approach to strength assessment of <b>stay</b> <b>ropes</b> in suspension bridges is considered. The rope working condition is analyzed by in-situ magnetic testing, computational assessment of ultimate breaking load {{and evaluation of}} residual margin of safety. The diagnostic parameters – distributed and/or local faults in wires – are used as input data for mechanical model of rope structure. The model allows calculating the stresses in each wire, simulating the degradation process and evaluating the rope breaking tensile load. The safety factor of deteriorated rope is considered as a generalized parameter that specifies the rope safe operation as an element of bridge stay arrangement. Examples of integrity analysis of stranded <b>stay</b> <b>ropes</b> and locked coil <b>stay</b> <b>ropes</b> are presented...|$|R
50|$|In a Veterans {{team meeting}} Ace took fault {{for the failure}} during a mission and volunteered {{to go to the}} Gauntlet.

2500|$|He {{attended}} Thetford Grammar School (1744–49), at a {{time when}} there was no compulsory education. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to his stay-maker father. Paine researchers contend his father's occupation has been widely misinterpreted to mean that he made the stays in ladies' corsets, which likely was an insult later invented by his political foes. Actually, the father and apprentice son made the thick <b>rope</b> <b>stays</b> (also called <b>stay</b> <b>ropes)</b> used on sailing ships. [...] Thetford historically had maintained a brisk trade with the downriver, then major, port town of King's Lynn.|$|R
50|$|Derrick saves Stefania {{before she}} is thrown off a ledge, and uses an {{elevator}} {{to take him}} deep into the silos, allowing him to reach Gianni's squad in a timely manner. Derrick defeats Solus, saves Alex and destroys Nexus, ending the T’lan threat. Derrick and Alex escape from Site Zero as it collapses. In a helicopter above the site with Stefania and Gianni, Alex questions the future; since she still exists, the future has divided into two separate timelines. As the pendulum effect begins to throw Alex into the future she {{jumps out of the}} helicopter to avoid dragging the others with her. Derrick has a choice: remaining in his own time or following her to destroy Nexus in her timeline. If Derrick chooses to go with Alex, they both go to an unknown future. If <b>Derrick</b> chooses to <b>stay</b> in the past, after the ending credits, a message from Dr. Ogawa will appear saying that since <b>Derrick</b> <b>stays</b> in the past, Alex dies alone.|$|R

2500|$|In July 1761, Paine {{returned}} to Thetford {{to work as}} a [...] officer. In December 1762, he became an Excise Officer in Grantham, Lincolnshire; in August 1764, he was transferred to Alford, also in Lincolnshire, at a salary of £50 per annum. On August 27, 1765, he was dismissed as an Excise Officer for [...] "claiming to have inspected goods he did not inspect." [...] On July 31, 1766, he requested his reinstatement from the Board of Excise, which they granted the next day, upon vacancy. While awaiting that, he worked as a stay-maker. Again, he was making <b>stay</b> <b>ropes</b> for shipping, not stays for corsets.|$|R
6000|$|Far down on {{a narrow}} ledge, They saw him cling to the {{crumbling}} edge. 'Wait for the bucket! Hi, man! <b>Stay!</b> That <b>rope</b> ain't safe! It's worn away! [...] He's taking his chance, [...] Slack out the line! Sweet Lord be with him!' cried Pennarby mine.|$|R
25|$|The Ptug was {{a special}} hang glider towing version of the Ascender II that was {{modified}} with a special rigid bridle {{to ensure that the}} tow <b>rope</b> <b>stayed</b> clear of the propeller.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stays</b> are <b>ropes,</b> wires, or rods on sailing {{vessels that}} run fore-and-aft along the {{centerline}} from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve {{to stabilize the}} masts. On a ship with a single mast, stays that run aft are called backstays and stays that run forward are called forestays. Along with shrouds, they form the primary stabilization for the standing rigging.|$|R
50|$|Rope swings are swings {{created by}} tying {{one end of}} a length of rope to a tree branch, bridge, or other {{elevated}} structure. A knot or loop is usually put on the other end to prevent fraying and help the swinger <b>stay</b> on. <b>Rope</b> swings are often situated so that those swinging on them can let go and land in water deep enough to cushion the fall and to be swum around in.|$|R
6000|$|There was resentment in the girl's expression. [...] "Since {{you have}} made up your mind to go, I will make no protest," [...] she declared. Then, with a swift change of manner, she turned and laid her hand upon his arm. [...] "After all, I suppose you must go. <b>Derrick,</b> you won't <b>stay</b> away very long!" ...|$|R
60|$|The men had not {{waited for}} orders, but had mustered to {{quarters}} {{on their own}} account. The guns were run in and loaded, and the boarding-pikes got ready. In five minutes orders were given to fire another shot. There was a cheer as white splinters were seen to fly from the Frenchman’s side. Her helm was put up at once, and she swept round and fired a broadside into the Furious. Four or five shots took effect, some <b>stays</b> and <b>ropes</b> were cut, and two shot swept across her deck, killing three of the sailors and knocking down several of the others.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 a brief {{study of}} hiring and promotional {{practices}} {{performed by the}} City of Philadelphia revealed a pattern of discrimination. The Valiants filed lawsuits to change the hiring practices of the Philadelphia Fire Department, {{which led to a}} consent decree in 1975, under which the department operated until the decree was stayed by a court in 2011, a total of 36 years. Under the decree, the department undertook to promote more black firemen to the upper ranks, and to increase recruitment and hiring of minorities. [...] By 2011, when the consent decree was <b>stayed,</b> <b>Derrick</b> Sawyer, an African-American, was leading the 2,100-strong department as Fire Commissioner.|$|R
50|$|Immunity Challenge: A team {{endurance}} challenge. A rope {{suspended in}} six divisions on a structure. The tribes must <b>stay</b> on the <b>rope</b> {{for as long}} as possible without touching the ground or the structure that suspends the rope. Game continues until all of one tribe's members have stepped off the rope. At Sunset, the tribes are given the option to both step down for the day, allowing for them to return to their islands. If they both choose to continue into the night, they would all sleep at the challenge.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} three or four hours' sail Geoffrey and Lionel {{acquired}} much nautical knowledge. They learned {{the difference between the}} mainmast and the mizzen, found that all the strong ropes that kept the masts erect and stiff were called <b>stays,</b> that the <b>ropes</b> that hoist sails are called halliards, and that sheets is the name given to the ropes that restrain the sails at the lower corner, and are used to haul them in more tightly when sailing close to the wind, or to ease them off when the wind is favourable. They also learned that the yards {{at the head of the}} main and mizzen sails are called gaffs, and those at the bottom, booms.|$|R
60|$|Then {{comes the}} most {{interesting}} part of the work--the rigging. First the masts, which must be light and tapering, and standing back at a slight angle, are set up, and the booms and yards are attached. A great deal of ingenuity can be displayed: in making the booms work well on the masts. The bowsprit is a simple matter, and the <b>stays,</b> or <b>ropes</b> which support and strengthen the masts, are very easily attached, as they are stationary affairs. But the working-tackle and the sails will show whether our young friend has a genius for boat-building or not. If his vessel has but a single mast, and he merely makes a mainsail and a jib, he will not have much trouble; but if he intends to fit out a schooner, a brig, or a ship, with sails that will work (and where is the boy with soul so dead as to have any other kind?), he will find {{that he will have}} a difficult job before him. But if he tries hard, and examines the construction and working of sails in real ships, he will also find that he can do it.|$|R
40|$|In October 2004 the European Union and the MERCOSUR {{tried to}} reach an {{agreement}} for creating what would be the world's largest free-trade area accounting for 650 millions people. But despite five years of bilateral work to strike a deal, the two parties <b>stayed</b> on <b>ropes</b> at their meeting in Portugal the 18 th of October 2004. The stumbling blocks are the MERCOSUR's demand for a greater access to EU's agricultural markets and the EU's demand for expanded access for industrial goods, services and investments. Though, both partners made great efforts to comply with each other requests, it wasn't enough. In this paper we are interested in the possible last EU's offer to enlarge access to its market through the allocation of bilateral tariff-rate quotas for some MERCOSUR's agricultural products namely corn, wheat, beef, poultry, swine and dairy products. Following the methodology of Elbehri and Pearson (Elbehri and R. 2000) we model bilateral tariff-rate quotas in GTAP using GEMPACK. We then, carry out our simulation to estimate the potential effects of expanding the MERCOSUR's access to these EU's markets.

5000|$|There is a {{suggestion}} that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped {{at an angle to}} aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each side stay was fitted at it lower end with a 150 mm toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side <b>stay</b> consisted of <b>ropes</b> looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about 500 - 800 mm long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About 4 turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v shape {{at the bottom of the}} angels [...] "wings" [...] jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.|$|R
25|$|In {{the next}} match, Lex Luger defended the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat in a No Disqualification match. However, Luger protested and wanted the match to occur with count-outs and {{disqualifications}} in effect. Steamboat agreed. Steamboat started the match {{with a bunch}} of roll-ups. Steamboat delivered several moves to dominate {{the early part of the}} match. Luger kicked Steamboat out of the ring and attacked him outside the ring but Steamboat delivered a Chop to Luger. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Mongolian Chop but Luger countered with many of high-impact moves. He made a pinfall attempt but got a near-fall. He got another near-fall and complained that he was not getting a fast count. He started clotheslining Steamboat and argued with referee Tommy Young. Steamboat took advantage and delivered a Crossbody for a near-fall. Luger started regaining momentum by hitting power moves on Steamboat. Steamboat countered Luger and delivered a Diving Mongolian Chop but got a near-fall. Luger <b>stayed</b> with the <b>ropes.</b> Steamboat tried to attack Luger but Luger delivered a Back Body Drop to Steamboat, sending him into the other ring. Luger shoved the referee and brought a chair. Steamboat delivered a Catapult to Luger and started attacking Luger with a chair to get disqualified. As a result, Luger won the match and retained the United States Heavyweight Championship. Steamboat continued to attack Luger with the chair after the match.|$|R
50|$|Mares' next fight {{took place}} on November 10, 2012, against the world No. 1 ranked bantamweight and then No.10 pound-for-pound Anselmo Moreno. Mares started the fight off fast, {{applying}} relentless pressure on Moreno, forcing Moreno to the ropes {{for the majority of}} the early rounds. Moreno still had his moments while the two were in the middle of the ring, landing clean shots, while Mares attempted to out work Moreno and attack his body while on the ropes. In the 5th round, Moreno was having success <b>staying</b> off the <b>ropes</b> when he could, and out boxing Mares in the center of the ring. Near the end of the round, Mares trapped Moreno on the ropes and landed a hard straight right hand, which ultimately sent Moreno to the canvas for the first time in his career. The following middle rounds of the fight, Mares seemed in control working the body and landing his hard overhand right, relentless pressuring Moreno {{for the majority of the}} rounds. In the 11th round, Moreno was docked a point for pushing Mares' head down while Mares rushed him on the ropes. This was seen as very controversial, given that Mares and Moreno both had been warned several times throughout the fight and only Moreno was docked a point. After the point deduction, Moreno effectively out pointed Mares in the middle of the ring during the final rounds and even successfully traded with Mares against the ropes, while Mares seemed to tire the final couple rounds.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} catastrophic {{eruption}} model for magnetar's enormous energy release during giant flares, {{in which a}} toroidal and helically twisted flux rope is embedded within a force-free magnetosphere. The flux <b>rope</b> <b>stays</b> in stable equilibrium states initially and evolves quasi-statically. Upon the loss of equilibrium point is reached, the flux rope cannot sustain the stable equilibrium states and erupts catastrophically. During the process, the magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere is rapidly released {{as the result of}} destabilization of global magnetic topology. The magnetospheric energy that could be accumulated is of vital importance for the outbursts of magnetars. We carefully establish the fully open fields and partially open fields for various boundary conditions at the magnetar surface and study the relevant energy thresholds. By investigating the magnetic energy accumulated at the critical catastrophic point, we find {{that it is possible to}} drive fully open eruptions for dipole dominated background fields. Nevertheless, it is hard to generate fully open magnetic eruptions for multipolar background fields. Given the observational importance of the multipolar magnetic fields in the vicinity of the magnetar surface, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility of the alternative eruption approach in multipolar background fields. Fortunately, we find that flux ropes may give rise to partially open eruptions in the multipolar fields, which involve only partial opening up of background fields. The energy release fractions are greater for cases with central-arcaded multipoles than those with central-caved multipoles emerged in background fields. Eruptions would fail only when the centrally-caved multipoles become extremely strong. Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R
40|$|This book {{considers}} the modelling {{and analysis of}} the many types of ropes, linear fibre assemblies. The construction of these structures is very diverse and in the work these are considered from the modelling point of view. As well as the conventional twisted structures, braid and plaited structures and parallel assemblies are modelled and analysed, first for their assembly and secondly for their mechanical behaviour. Also since the components are assemblies of components, fibres into yarns, into strands, and into ropes the hierarchical nature of the construction is considered. The focus of the modelling is essentially toward load extension behaviour but there is reference to bending of ropes, encompassed by the two extremes, no slip between the components and zero friction resistance to component slip. Friction in ropes is considered both between the rope components, sliding, sawing and scissoring, and within the components, dilation and distortion, these latter modes being used to model component set, the phenomenon instrumental in rope proofing. The exploitation of the modelling is closed by the suggested modelling and analysis of component wear and life limitation and also of rope steady state heating. These will require extensive experimentation to extract the necessary coefficients, achievable by parallel testing of prototypes and similar structures. This development is focused on the modelling and analysis of ropes and other similar structures. All the modelling is based on the Principle of Virtual Work and admissible modes of deformation. Finally this book is directed towards the various industries involved in design, manufacture and use of <b>ropes,</b> <b>stays</b> and other similar structures...|$|R
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to <b>stay</b> off the <b>ropes.</b> He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|R
40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are {{the most}} violent {{phenomena}} observed on the Sun. One {{of the most successful}} models to explain CMEs is the flux rope ejection model, where a magnetic flux rope is expelled from the solar corona after a long phase along which the flux <b>rope</b> <b>stays</b> in equilibrium while magnetic energy is being accumulated. However, still many questions are outstanding on the detailed mechanism of the ejection and observations continuously provide new data to interpret and put in the context. Currently, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) are providing new insights into the early phase of CME evolution. In particular, observations show the ejection of magnetic flux ropes from the solar corona and how they evolve into CMEs. However, these observations are difficult to interpret in terms of basic physical mechanisms and quantities, thus, we need to compare equivalent quantities to test and improve our models. In our work, we intend {{to bridge the gap between}} models and observations with our model of flux rope ejection where we consistently describe the full life span of a flux rope from its formation to ejection. This is done by coupling the global non-linear force-free model (GNLFFF) built to describe the slow low- β formation phase, with a full MHD simulation run with the software MPI-AMRVAC, suitable to describe the fast MHD evolution of the flux rope ejection that happens in a heterogeneous β regime. We also explore the parameter space to identify the conditions upon which the ejection is favoured (gravity stratification and magnetic field intensity) and we produce synthesised AIA observations (171 Å and 211 Å). To carry this out, we run 3 D MHD simulation in spherical coordinates where we include the role of thermal conduction and radiative losses, both of which are important for determining the temperature distribution of the solar corona during a CME. Our model of flux rope ejection is successful in realistically describing the entire life span of a flux rope and we also set some conditions for the backgroud solar corona to favour the escape of the flux rope, so that it turns into a CME. Furthermore, our MHD simulation reproduces many of the features found in the AIA observations. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
