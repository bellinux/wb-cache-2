500|$|Indian {{journalist}} and LGBT-rights activist Ashok Row Kavi praised Dostana: [...] "I am <b>glad,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in}} Indian popular cinema, gays were not turned into caricatures and made fun of. What the film has done is to bring to notice gays as a concept in [...] Indian family." [...] Its depiction of a homosexual character's acceptance by his mother was seen as encouraging acceptance of gay people. According to a Daily News and Analysis article, [...] "gay talk" [...] went mainstream in Bollywood with the film: [...] "Films like Dostana are playful and funny [...] bring sexuality as a dinner-table conversation piece. Bollywood is open to diversity in terms of subjects, including sexuality, and the audiences are ready to accept diversified subjects".|$|E
500|$|Adams {{took another}} [...] "fierce woman" [...] part in Paul Thomas Anderson's {{psychological}} drama The Master (2012). She played Peggy Dodd, the ruthless and manipulative {{wife of the}} leader of a cult (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). It marked her third and final collaboration with Hoffman, whom she deeply admired, before his death two years later. The organization depicted in the film was deemed by journalists to be based on Scientology; Adams considered the comparison to be misleading but was <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attention the film brought to it. Although not a method actor, Adams believed that the intense role had left her on edge in her personal life. Drawing comparisons to Lady Macbeth's character, the critic Justin Chang wrote that Adams' [...] "pertness has rarely seemed so malevolent", and Donald Clarke of The Irish Times commended her for playing the part with [...] "discrete menace". John Patterson of The Guardian noted that a scene in which she chastises Hoffman's character while furiously masturbating him {{was one of the most}} significant sequences in the film. Adams was nominated for her fourth Academy Award, and also received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for her supporting part.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and we tried to do this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E

Etim in an interview with Leadership Newspaper stated: [...] "I am not exactly a rookie {{when it comes to the}} Igbo Language but until Phone Swap, I never needed to speak Igbo as a native would. I will admit that it was quite challenging, because I had to learn a specific dialect. I am very <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> experience, though Igbo is a very interesting language and I enjoyed myself immensely in the process of learning it".|$|E

2500|$|Damnation and a Day {{arrived in}} 2003; Sony's heavyweight funding {{underwriting}} Cradle's undiminished ambition by finally bringing a real orchestra {{into the studio}} (the 80-member Budapest Film Orchestra and Choir replacing the increasingly sophisticated synthesisers of previous albums) and thus marking the band's belated gestation—for one album only—into full-blown symphonic metal. Damnation featured the band's most complex compositions to date, outran its predecessors by a good twenty minutes and produced two more popular videos: the Jan Švankmajer-influenced Mannequin and Babalon A.D. (So <b>Glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Madness), based on Pier Paolo Pasolini's film Salò. Roughly half the album trod the conceptual territory of John Milton's Paradise Lost—showing {{the events of the}} fall of man through the eyes of Lucifer—while the remainder comprised stand-alone tracks such as the Nile tribute [...] "Doberman Pharaoh" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "Babalon A. D."; a reference to Aleister Crowley. [...] "Babalon A. D." [...] was the first DVD-only single to reach the UK's top 40 charts, according to the Guinness Book of Records of British Hit Singles and Albums. Feeling that Sony's enthusiasm quickly palled however, Cradle jumped ship to Roadrunner Records after barely a year.|$|E
60|$|His wild flight ceased abruptly. There was {{no place}} to which to flee. He slunk forlornly through the deserted camp, smelling the rubbish-heaps and the {{discarded}} rags and tags of the gods. He would have been <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rattle of stones about him, flung by an angry squaw, <b>glad</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hand of Grey Beaver descending upon him in wrath; while he would have welcomed with delight Lip-lip and the whole snarling, cowardly pack.|$|E
