5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate,</b> to pass without a vote.|$|E
25|$|The GNC {{failed to}} stand {{down at the}} end of its <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> in January 2014, {{unilaterally}} voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests. Residents of the eastern city of Shahat, along with protesters from Bayda and Sousse, staged a large demonstration, rejecting the GNC's extension plan and demanding the resignation of the congress followed by a peaceful power transition to a legitimate body. They also protested the lack of security, blaming the GNC for failing to build the army and police. Other Libyans rejecting the proposed mandate rallied in Tripoli's Martyrs Square and outside Benghazi's Tibesti Hotel, calling for the freeze of political parties and the re-activation of the country's security system.|$|E

25|$|The Liberals {{called a}} general {{election}} for January 1910, and Law {{spent most of the}} preceding months campaigning up and down the country for other Conservative candidates and MPs, sure that his Dulwich seat was safe. He obtained an increased majority of 2,418. The overall result was more confused: the Conservatives gained 116 seats, bringing their total to 273, but this was still less than the Liberal caucus, and produced a hung parliament, as neither had a majority of the seats (the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Labour Party and the All-for-Ireland League took more than 120 seats in total). The Liberals remained in office {{with the support of the}} Irish Parliamentary Party. The Budget passed through the House of Commons a second time, and – as it now had an <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> – was then approved by the House of Lords without a division.|$|E
25|$|The AKP {{government}} had allegedly proposed {{to hold an}} early general election in November 2014 if their candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won the 2014 presidential election, especially due to opinion polls predicting a comfortable victory for Erdoğan in the first round. This would allow the AKP's new leader to seek an <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> {{in their own right}} rather than serving the remainder of Erdoğan's term before seeking re-election. Although Erdoğan did win outright with 51.79% of the vote, his popular vote share was significantly below what opinion polls predicted. The presidential election results, according to several political commentators and journalists, greatly reduced the possibility of holding an early election, although some reports claimed that the government were preparing for an early election in April 2015. In October 2014, the AKP parliamentary group leader Naci Bostancı ruled out any prospect of holding the election early and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu stated in November that they would be held in June as per normal. Despite this, speculation in December 2014 as to whether the election would be brought forward in order not to clash with summer examinations remained. In the end, no such initiative was taken and Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) went on with the date 7 June. Some schools changed the times of examinations in order to not clash with polling day.|$|E

500|$|The Finance Bill {{passed the}} Commons on 5 November 1909 but was {{rejected}} by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate.</b> The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested {{that this would be a}} suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass. In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered [...] "outrageous" [...] by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2004, {{following}} Livingstone's re-election, {{the results}} of the consultation on the Western Extension were published which showed that a substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension, however Livingstone said he was going ahead and that the polls were a [...] "charade" [...] which did not diminish his <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate.</b> [...] "A consultation is not a referendum" [...] he said. Protests continued against the extension, with residents arguing that only 5% of the road space in the selected area was congested. Following on in May 2005 a further TFL consultation began with specific proposals about the extensions. These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to [...] "boost trade at London's theatres, restaurants and cinemas".|$|E
2500|$|In response, the Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House, Wong Kan Seng, raised two points. First, {{he argued}} that Singaporeans living in GRCs vote [...] "with the {{knowledge}} that should a vacancy arise (before the next General Elections) such a vacancy need not be filled", since this was provided for in the law. He added that the constitutional rights of the voters had not been diminished nor the PAP's <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> thwarted, as there were still MPs in the GRC to carry on with their roles. Secondly, {{on the issue of}} Heng acting as a [...] "replacement", Wong recognized that the Government could not appoint a replacement MP to represent the voters.

2500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} in May 2008, and witnessed a turnout of approximately 45% of eligible voters, with Johnson receiving 43.2% and Livingstone 37% of first-preference votes; when second-preference votes were added, Johnson proved victorious with 53.2% to Livingstone's 46.8%. Johnson benefited from a large voter turnout in Conservative strongholds, in particular Bexley and Bromley. Johnson thus won the largest personal <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> in the UK. Following his victory, he praised Livingstone as a [...] "very considerable public servant" [...] and added that he hoped to [...] "discover {{a way in which}} the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London". He also announced that, {{as a result of his}} victory, he would resign as Member of Parliament for Henley, generating some anger from Henley party members and constituents who felt that Johnson was abandoning them for London.|$|E
2500|$|The GNC also {{included}} members associated with conservative Islamist Groups {{as well as}} revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had {{a conflict of interest}} due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards some armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. [...] Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda; voting to declare sharia law and establishing [...] "a special committee" [...] to [...] "review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law"; imposing gender segregation and compulsory hijab at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate</b> expired in January 2014 until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named Operation Dignity ( [...] ; 'Amaliya al-Karamah).|$|E
2500|$|Since the Parliament Act the Unionists {{could no}} longer block Home Rule in the House of Lords, but only delay Royal Assent by two years. Asquith decided to {{postpone}} any concessions to the Unionists until the bill's third passage through the Commons, when he believed the Unionists would be desperate for a compromise. Jenkins concluded that had Asquith tried for an earlier agreement, {{he would have had}} no luck, as many of his opponents wanted a fight and the opportunity to smash his government. Sir Edward Carson, MP for Dublin University and leader of the Irish Unionists in Parliament, threatened a revolt if Home Rule was enacted. The new Conservative leader, Bonar Law, campaigned in Parliament and in northern Ireland, warning Ulstermen against [...] "Rome Rule", that is, domination by the island's Catholic majority. Many who opposed Home Rule felt that the Liberals had violated the Constitution—by pushing through major constitutional change without a clear <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate,</b> with the House of Lords, formerly the [...] "watchdog of the constitution", not reformed as had been promised in the preamble of the 1911 Act—and thus justified actions that in other circumstances might be treason.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} campaign began {{the week after}} Labour Day, when the Legislature would normally {{have been expected to}} return to work, had there been no {{election campaign}}.

After referendum was denied, an electronic signature-gathering started. It was claimed by the Spilna Sprava that on 12 April 2011 nearly 250 000 signatures were collected.|$|R

The number of seats in the District changed regularly; since the 1987 elections, there are 40 district councils in Margareten. In 1987, the <b>electoral</b> <b>mandates</b> were distributed as follows: 22 SPÖ, 12 ÖVP, 4 Freedom Party (FPÖ) and 2 GAL (green).|$|R
2500|$|The budget {{divided the}} country and {{provoked}} bitter debate through the summer of 1909. The Northcliffe Press (The Times and the Daily Mail) urged rejection of the budget to give tariff reform (indirect taxes on imported goods which, it was felt, would encourage British industry and trade within the Empire) a chance; there were many public meetings, some of them organised by dukes, in protest at the budget. Many Liberal politicians attacked the peers, including Lloyd George in his Limehouse speech, {{in which he said}} [...] "a fully-equipped Duke costs as much to keep up as two dreadnoughts (battleships)" [...] and was [...] "less easy to scrap". King Edward privately urged Conservative leaders Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to pass the Budget (this was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreement between the two Houses over the Irish Church Act 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884). From July it became increasingly clear that the Tory peers would reject the budget, partly in the hope of forcing an election. If they rejected it, Asquith determined, he would have to ask King Edward to dissolve Parliament, four years into a seven-year term, as it would mean the legislature had refused supply. The budget passed the Commons on 4 November 1909, but was voted down in the Lords on the 30th, the Lords passing a resolution by Lord Lansdowne stating that they were entitled to oppose the finance bill as it lacked an <b>electoral</b> <b>mandate.</b> Asquith had Parliament prorogued three days later for an election beginning on 15 January 1910, with the Commons first passing a resolution deeming the Lords' vote to be an attack on the constitution.|$|E

Second, despite recurrent infringements on political and civil rights, they maintain that their power is rule-based and embodies the will of the people, as they have been given popular <b>electoral</b> <b>mandates.</b> Third, they couple these elements with inputbased legitimation strategies that focus on nationalist ideologies, the personal capabilities and charismatic aura of the rulers, and the regime's foundational myth.
