25|$|The {{keyboard}} on the teleprinter {{played a}} strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication {{for most of}} the 20th century, while the keyboard on the <b>keypunch</b> device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a <b>keypunch</b> device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.|$|E
25|$|A <b>keypunch</b> is {{a device}} for {{manually}} entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|E

25|$|Famous inventions and {{developments}} by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic {{random access}} memory (DRAM), the electronic <b>keypunch,</b> the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM {{has been one of}} the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, 1973, {{the body}} of 20-year-old Rosa Vasquez, last seen May 26, [...] was found strangled near the Arguello {{boulevard}} entrance at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. The victim had been thrown seven feet off the roadway into some shrubs. Vasquez had been a <b>keypunch</b> operator at Letterman General Hospital on the Presidio.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the American Herman Hollerith invented data storage on punched cards that {{could then be}} read by a machine. To process these punched cards he invented the tabulator, and the <b>keypunch</b> machine. His {{machines}} used electromechanical relays and counters. [...] Hollerith's method {{was used in the}} 1890 United States Census. [...] That census was processed two years faster than the prior census had been. Hollerith's company eventually became the core of IBM.|$|E

2500|$|Giarritano {{tried to}} reassure her {{that she did not}} have to use {{narcotics}} in order to succeed in the music business. [...] She also said that if she were to avoid singing professionally, she would have to become a <b>keypunch</b> operator (as she had done a few years earlier) or a secretary, and then a wife and mother, and she would have to become very similar to all the other women in Port Arthur.|$|E
2500|$|He {{invented the}} first {{automatic}} card-feed mechanism {{and the first}} <b>keypunch.</b> [...] The 1890 Tabulator was hardwired to operate on 1890 Census cards. A control panel in his 1906 Type I Tabulator simplified rewiring for different jobs. [...] The 1920s removable control panel supported prewiring and near instant job changing. These inventions were among {{the foundations of the}} data processing industry and Hollerith's punched cards (later used for computer input/output) continued in use for almost a century.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1971, the IBM 029 Kanji <b>Keypunch</b> {{was able}} to punch 2950 Kanji characters, the <b>keypunch</b> operator's left hand {{selecting}} one of 15 shift keys and the right hand selecting one of 240 Kanji characters for that shift.|$|E

5000|$|IBM was {{the largest}} {{supplier}} of unit record equipment (punched cards, <b>keypunches,</b> accounting machines, ...) {{in the first part}} of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Later several OEM {{companies}} built 96-column <b>keypunches,</b> sorters, and collators. This {{took the}} 'heavy lifting' {{off of the}} MFCU and freed the System/3 for actual computing functions.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} keying your punched cards through the console was a {{marketing}} ploy. In reality, the System/3 {{could not be}} a computer and a <b>keypunch</b> at the same time, so when it was a <b>keypunch,</b> no computing was possible. The original IBM System/3 which was shown in July, 1969 had the <b>keypunch</b> console so they could offer a computer for under $2,000/month. In reality it was unworkable and almost invariably users acquired a stand-alone keypunch/verifier.|$|E
50|$|In many data {{processing}} applications, the punched cards were verified by keying {{exactly the same}} data a second time, {{checking to see if}} the second keying and the punched data were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for <b>keypunch</b> operators, usually women, who worked full-time on <b>keypunch</b> and verifier machines, often in large <b>keypunch</b> departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input. In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a <b>keypunch</b> replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals {{led to the development of}} additional key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.|$|E

50|$|With the {{development}} of computers punched cards found new uses as their principal input media. Punched cards were used not only for data, but for a new application - computer programs, see: Computer programming in the punched card era.

5000|$|The {{transistorized}} IBM 129 Card Data Recorder's primary {{advantage over}} other IBM <b>keypunches</b> {{was that it}} featured an electronic 80-column buffer to hold the card image [...] When using earlier IBM <b>keypunches,</b> a keystroke error required the card to be ejected by pressing the Release and Register keys, the error corrected by pressing the Duplicate key until the error column was reached, typing the correct data {{for the rest of}} that card, then pressing the Release key and manually removing the bad card from the output card stacker before it was placed in the deck (this required some practice, but quickly became an automatic action that you no longer had to think about). With the 129, a keystroke error could be erased by pressing the Backspace key and re-keyed. The entire 80-column card was punched automatically, as fast as the mechanism could go, when the Release key was pressed.|$|R
