5|$|An {{example of}} the chronicle's bias against the {{descendants}} of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson {{is one of the}} two miracle narratives preserved by this source. The story in question is about a miracle attributed to St Mary, which may have been incorporated into the chronicle in order to discredit the reign of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Whatever the case, the story deals with an aged chieftain named Domnall, who is described as a close friend of Haraldr Óláfsson, and regarded by the latter as worthier than others. The chronicle relates how Domnall and his young son were forced to flee from Haraldr Guðrøðarson to the sanctuary of the Church of St Mary at Rushen. The latter, however, is stated to have tricked them into leaving the church-grounds, whereupon they were immediately seized. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> need, so the story says, that Domnall's prayers to St Mary were answered, and that it was through her divine intervention that he and his son escaped from their imprisonment. The chronicle states that Domnall himself recounted the story to the chronicle's compilers. The account itself seems to have been used as means to portray Haraldr Guðrøðarson as a distrustful oath-breaker, and thereby further discredit the line of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson; conversely, the connection between Haraldr Óláfsson and the divinely favoured Domnall may have been intended to imply legitimacy in regards to Óláfr's line. Although the identities of Domnall and his son are uncertain, there is reason to suspect that they are identical to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, and his son, Aonghus Mór (died c. 1293).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a splenectomy. When Susan learns that her health insurance will not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical benefits. They agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose. On his way to dinner, Mike is a victim of a hit-and-run at the hands of Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a dentist whom Susan had recently befriended.|$|E
5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E

40|$|The {{brain is}} easily able to process and {{categorize}} complex time-varying signals. For example, the two sentences, “It is cold <b>in</b> London <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year ” and “It is hot <b>in</b> London <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, ” have different meanings, {{even though the}} words hot and cold appear several seconds before {{the ends of the}} two sentences. Any network that can tell these sentences apart must therefore have a long temporal memory. In other words, {{the current state of the}} network must depend on events that happened several seconds ago. This is a difficult task, as neurons are dominated by relatively short time constants—tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Nevertheless, it was recently proposed that randomly connected networks could exhibit the long memories necessary for complex temporal processing. This is an attractive idea, both for its simplicity and because little tuning of recurrent synaptic weights is required. However, we show that when connectivity is high, as it is in the mammalian brain, randomly connected networks cannot exhibit temporal memory much longer than the <b>time</b> constants <b>of</b> their constituent neurons. ...|$|R

Filderman was brought in by Meirov to supervise Zissu's initiatives, the Mossad being largely unaware of their irreconcilable differences. Filderman fought against his rival's decision to prioritize the ships for Zionist families while Jews of other convictions were pushed back. In late July, the Mossad concluded that Zissu's contacts with the Antonescu government had little strategic value, and Haim Barlas informed him that the Rescue Committee no longer considered him its representative. Having secured Trachtenberg's support, Zissu fought against this decision, and threatened that the entire Zionist Executive would leave with him.|$|E
25|$|After the Berlin Wall {{came down}} in November 1989, the first broken links were re-established, with Friedrichstraße on 1 July 1990, as the first. The BVG and DR jointly marketed the {{services}} soon after the reunification. Administratively, the divided S-Bahn networks remained separate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> momentous changes, encompassing German reunification and reunification of Berlin into a single city, although the dividing line {{was no longer the}} former Berlin Wall. DR and BVG (of the whole of reunified Berlin from 1 January 1992, after absorbing BVB of East Berlin) operated individual lines end to end, both into the other party's territories. For example, S2 was all BVG even after it was extended northward and southward into Brandenburg/former East German territory. The main east-west route (Stadtbahn) was a joint operation. Individual trains were operated by either BVG or DR end-to-end on the same tracks. This arrangement ended on 1 January 1994, with the creation of Deutsche Bahn due to the merger between DR and the former West Germany's Deutsche Bundesbahn. All S-Bahn operations in Berlin were transferred to the newly formed S-Bahn Berlin GmbH as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, and the BVG withdrew from running S-Bahn services.|$|E

500|$|Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American {{character}} {{who served as}} one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II soldier. [...] Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as [...] "an inoffensive, ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war." [...] The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the [...] "little guy" [...] living up {{to a sense of}} duty <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> war. [...] Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 – May 1, 1943.

500|$|Early in 1848, Smetana {{wrote to}} Franz Liszt, {{whom he had}} not yet met, asking him to accept the {{dedication}} of a new piano work, Six Characteristic Pieces, and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance. This encouragement {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career. Despite Liszt's lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students. After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism in whose eyes Smetana was developing a reputation. Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he [...] "could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language." [...] In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kateřina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor Ferdinand, who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matinée concerts. Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> relative financial stability Smetana married Kateřina, on 27August 1849.
