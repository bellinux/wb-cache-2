40|$|Treatment of steroid-resistant acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} (GVHD) remains an unmet {{clinical}} need. <b>Inolimomab,</b> a monoclonal antibody to CD 25, has shown encouraging results in phase 2 trials. This phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter trial compared <b>inolimomab</b> vs usual care in adult patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Patients {{were randomly selected}} to receive treatment with <b>inolimomab</b> or usual care (the control group was treated with antithymocyte globulin [ATG]). The primary objective was to evaluate overall survival at 1 year without changing baseline allocated therapy. A total of 100 patients were randomly placed: 49 patients in the <b>inolimomab</b> arm and 51 patients in the ATG arm. The primary criteria were reached by 14 patients (28. 5 %) in the <b>inolimomab</b> and 11 patients (21. 5 %) in the ATG arms, with a hazard ratio of 0. 874 (P =. 28). With a minimum follow-up of 1 year, 26 (53 %) and 31 (60 %) patients died in the <b>inolimomab</b> and ATG arms, respectively. Adverse events were similar in the 2 arms, with fewer viral infections in the <b>inolimomab</b> arm compared with the ATG arm. The primary end point of this randomized phase 3 trial was not achieved. The lack of a statistically significant effect confirms the need for development of more effective treatments for acute GVHD. This trial is registered to [URL] as EUDRACT 2007 - 005009 - 24.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <b>Inolimomab,</b> a {{monoclonal}} antibody against interleukin (IL) - 2 Ralpha (CD 25) has shown promising {{results in the}} treatment of corticosteroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The objective {{of the present study was}} to characterise the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of <b>inolimomab</b> as first-line treatment in this condition. METHODS: The data came from 21 patients with acute GvHD (8 with an International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [IBMTR] score of B, 11 with a score of C and 2 with a score of D) following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a median delay of 26 days (range 10 - 127 days). <b>Inolimomab</b> was administered at 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 or 0. 4 mg/kg daily in association with methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg) for 8 or 16 days depending on the status at day 9. Then, for responder patients, administrations were continued three times weekly until day 28. <b>Inolimomab</b> concentrations and pharmacodynamic data (acute GvHD scores) were recorded during the study. The pharmacodynamic data were assessed in four grades according to the IBMTR and Glucksberg classification in parallel with Karnofsky scores. A population analysis was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effects model to define the pharmacokinetic model, to test covariates and, when apparent, to model the exposure-effect relationship by a proportional odds model. The modelling was finally qualified by a predictive check. RESULTS: The best pharmacokinetic model was two-compartmental. For each score, the most demonstrative exposure-effect graphics linked the cumulative area under the concentration-time curve to cumulated probabilities of observing a specific score. This relationship was identified as a maximum effect model for the skin (with two patient subpopulations: sensitive/less sensitive) and a linear model for the intestinal tract and liver. No covariate was identified as influencing any of these parameters. CONCLUSION: <b>Inolimomab</b> exposure-effect relationships as first-line treatment for acute GvHD have been identified and modelled. The discovered dose-effect relationship allows confirmation of the treatment response, thereby establishing the first step towards optimising the <b>inolimomab</b> dosage in future trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRefractory acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} (aGVHD) remains an {{important}} cause of mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. No standard therapy exists once steroids fail {{to obtain a}} good response. In 2006, our group published a series of patients who received <b>inolimomab,</b> an anti–interleukin- 2 receptor monoclonal antibody, as salvage therapy with initial encouraging results. In this update, we analyzed a larger group of patients with prolonged follow-up. Ninety-two consecutive patients were treated with <b>inolimomab</b> at our center between April 1999 and December 2011. Overall response rate was 42 % (complete response in 14 %) on day + 30. Predictors of failure to respond in the multivariate analysis were overall aGVHD grade IV, instauration of <b>inolimomab</b> before day 15 of aGVHD diagnosis, and severe lymphopenia. Patients without gastrointestinal involvement appeared to do better, with a 70 % response rate compared with 39 % in patients with gastrointestinal involvement (P =. 06). However, the 2 -year overall survival rate was of 18 % for the entire cohort (95 % confidence interval, 10 % to 26 %) and 33 % for day 30 responders (95 % confidence interval, 25 % to 40 %) and Acute GVHD was {{the main cause of}} death (49 %) followed by opportunistic infections (27 %). Results of this update show that although <b>inolimomab</b> is a well-tolerated drug with a moderate number of short-term responses, it is associated with long-term survival in only one-third of responding patients. These data highlight the need to investigate new rescue treatments with sustained effect and the importance of reporting long-term outcomes in GVHD studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteroid-refractory acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} (aGVHD) remains an {{important}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). A protocol on the management of aGVHD was introduced in our center that incorporated a prospective study on combination therapy with <b>inolimomab</b> (anti-IL- 2 Rα) and etanercept (anti–tumor necrosis factor-α) for steroid-refractory aGVHD. We evaluated the efficacy and safety in 21 consecutively treated patients. The patients had developed refractory aGVHD after SCT (n =  16) or donor lymphocyte infusion (n =  5), and aGVHD was classified as severe in all patients, mostly due to gastrointestinal involvement stages 2 to 4. No drug-related side effects were observed apart from the infections expected to occur in these severely immunocompromised patients. Overall response at day 28 of second-line therapy was 48 % (10 / 21), with 6 and 4 patients achieving a complete and partial response, respectively. Eventually, 19 patients died (90 %), with early mortality (< 6  months) predominantly resulting from refractory aGVHD and secondary infections and late mortality resulting from relapse of the underlying disease. With a median follow-up of 55  days, the estimated rates of 6 -month and 2 -year overall survival were dismal, 29 % and 10 %, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of <b>inolimomab</b> and etanercept for steroid-refractory aGVHD failed to improve the dismal prognosis of severe steroid-refractory aGVHD...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the optimal treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (SR-aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In our center, the treatment policy has changed over time with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) being used from 1999 to 2003, and etanercept or <b>inolimomab</b> after 2004. An observational study compared survival and infection rates in all consecutive patients receiving 1 of these 3 treatments. Ninety-three patients were included. The main end point was overall survival (OS). Median age was 37 years. Acute GVHD developed at a median of 15 days after transplantation. Second-line treatment was initiated a median of 12 days after aGVHD diagnosis. Therapies were MMF in 56 %, <b>inolimomab</b> in 22 %, and etanercept in 23 % of the patients. Overall, second-line treatment response rate was 45 % (complete response: 28 %), MMF: 55 %, inolimomab: 35 %, and etanercept: 28 %. With 74  months median follow-up, the 2 -year survival was 30 % (95 % confidence interval: 22 - 41). Risk factors significantly associated with OS in multivariate analysis were disease status at transplantation; grade III-IV aGVHD at second-line treatment institution; and liver involvement. None of the second-line therapy influenced this poor outcome. Viral and fungal infections were not statistically different among the 3 treatment options; however, bacterial infections were more frequent in patients treated with anticytokines. Over an 11 -year period, 3 treatment strategies, including 2 anticytokines, give similar results in patients with SR-aGVHD...|$|E
