Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 49% of {{diamonds}} originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant {{sources of the}} mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African paramilitary groups.

[...] However a kick that is too long or misdirected and goes out of the field of play without first bouncing in it results in a penalty being awarded to the non-kicking team.|$|R
5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
25|$|Mudpots: Mudpots such as Fountain Paint Pots are acidic {{hot springs}} {{with a limited}} water supply. Some {{microorganisms}} use hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell), which rises <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the earth, as an energy source. They convert the gas into sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock into clay.|$|E
50|$|Wet-cleaning systems {{naturally}} require drying time, {{which may}} lead to concerns about very slow drying, the risk of soiling returning during drying as the moisture evaporates bringing the soils <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> the pile to the surface, as well as odors, bacteria, fungi, molds, and mildews. Carpet cleaning specialists {{try to find a}} balance between rapid drying (attributable to lower flow rate through the cleaning jets of a spray system) and the need to remove the most soil (attributable to higher flow rate).|$|R
50|$|Matadi {{was founded}} by Sir Henry Morton Stanley in 1879. It was {{strategically}} important {{because it was the}} last navigable port on the Congo River and therefore the furthest inland port in the Congo Free State. The construction of the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (built between 1890 and 1898) made it possible to transport goods <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> Congo's interior to the port of Matadi and the city became an important trading center. Portuguese and French West-African commercial interests influenced the city's architecture and urban design which borrowed from the neighboring colonies in Angola and the Congo-Brazzaville.|$|R
40|$|Multiphoton {{excitation}} {{fluorescence imaging}} generates an optical section of sample by restricting fluorophore excitation {{to the plane}} of focus. High photon densities, achieved only in the focal volume of the objective, are sufficient to excite the fluorescent probe molecules by density-dependent, multiphoton excitation processes. We present comparisons of confocal with multiphoton excitation imaging of identical optical sections within a sample. These side-by-side comparisons of imaging modes demonstrate a significant advantage of multiphoton imaging; data can be obtained <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> biological specimens. Observations {{on a variety of}} biological samples showed that in all cases there was at least a twofold improvement in the imaging penetration depth obtained with multiphoton excitation relative to confocal imaging. The more pronounced degradation in image contrast <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> a confocally imaged sample is primarily due to scattered emission photons, which reduce the signal and increase the local background as measurements of point spread functions indicated that resolution does not significantly change with increasing depth for either mode of microscopy. Multiphoton imaging does not suffer from degradation of signal-to-background to nearly the same extent as confocal imaging because this method is insensitive to scatter of the emitted signal. Direct detection of emitted photons using an external photodetector mounted close to the objective (possible only in a multiphoton imaging system) improves system sensitivity and the utilization of scattered emission photons for imaging. We demonstrate that this technique provides yet further improvements in the capability of multiphoton excitation imaging to produce good quality images <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> tissue relative to confocal imaging...|$|R
25|$|Netzer was a playmaker and is {{considered}} one of the best midfielders of all time, gaining a lot of attention with his long passes and pushes <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> his own half of the pitch. Apart from his superior ball skills, his natural authority made him the undisputed leader of his team. As a player for Borussia Mönchengladbach, he enjoyed a lot of freedom from the management and the coach Hennes Weisweiler, even off the pitch.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common causes of falsely high breath {{analyzer}} readings is the existence of mouth alcohol. In analyzing a subject's breath sample, the breath analyzer's internal computer is making the assumption that the alcohol in the breath sample came from alveolar air—that is, air exhaled <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the lungs. However, alcohol may have come from the mouth, throat or stomach for a number of reasons. To help guard against mouth-alcohol contamination, certified breath-test operators are trained to observe a test subject carefully for at least 15–20 minutes before administering the test.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the geochemical signature of the lavas present on Iceland and in the north Atlantic. The resulting picture is consistent in several important respects. For instance, it is not contested {{that the source of}} the volcanism in the mantle is chemically and petrologically heterogeneous: it contains not only normal peridotite, but also eclogite – a fertile rock originating from subducted slabs – both of which contribute to the melts. The origin of the latter is assumed to be metamorphosed, very old oceanic crust which sank into the mantle several hundreds of millions of years ago during the subduction of an ocean, then upwelled <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|Why Oval BA {{turned red}} is not understood. According to a 2008 study by Dr. Santiago Pérez-Hoyos of the University of the Basque Country, {{the most likely}} {{mechanism}} is [...] "an upward and inward diffusion of either a colored compound or a coating vapor that may interact later with high energy solar photons at the upper levels of Oval BA." [...] Some believe that small storms (and their corresponding white spots) on Jupiter turn red when the winds become powerful enough to draw certain gases <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> the atmosphere which change color when those gases are exposed to sunlight.|$|R
40|$|Two new 14 C {{dates from}} {{a bed of}} compact inter-tidal peat at Mill Strand, Portrush, are {{reported}} and discussed in relation to two previously obtained ages from peat at Dhu Varren, a short distance inland. The date {{from the top of}} the Mill Strand peat is statistically inseparable from that of the peat top at Dhu Varren. Together these dates indicate the cessation of peat growth occurred ~ 6950 - 6550 cal. BP as a result of sand deposition associated with sea-level rise. However, dated samples <b>from</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>within</b> the respective stratigraphies are not compatible. Their respective ages in relation to their elevations pose a problem of interpretation...|$|R
25|$|Russian {{authorities}} {{tried to}} blame the pogrom on the local Polish population in order to stir up the hatred between two ethnic groups (both of which generally opposed the Tsar). However Jewish survivors of the violence reported that the local Polish population had in fact sheltered many Jews during the pogrom and {{did not participate in}} it. Apolinary Hartglas, a Polish Jewish leader and later a member of the Polish Sejm, together with Ze'ev Jabotinsky, managed to obtain secret documents issued by Szeremietiev which showed that the pogrom had been organized well in advance by Russian authorities who had actually transported Russian railroad workers <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> Russia to participate. A commission set up by the Duma charged with investigating the pogrom came to similar conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Farmers {{cleared the}} land of trees and drained the swamps, but farming was {{difficult}} due to the glacial till beneath the shallow soil. Other settlers turned to the natural resources left by the glaciers and mined sand and gravel deposits. Limestone and clay mines were opened in the area; shale was discovered and was mined, as well as bituminous coal. Coal mining was a profitable enterprise and seven coal beds were deep mined and later strip mined. Later still, wells were drilled to extract {{oil and natural gas}} <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the Earth. When the mines were cleared and the wells tapped out, the land was left barren. Since the mines were left uncapped, the topsoil eroded from the land.|$|E
500|$|Explosion-dominated eruptions {{occur when}} {{a body of}} magma (called a dike) <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> Io's {{partially}} molten mantle reaches the surface at a fissure.

It is produced by a large amount of exposed, fresh lava within the fountains at the eruption source vent. Outburst eruptions at Tvashtar in November 1999 and February 2007 centred on a [...] long, [...] tall lava [...] "curtain" [...] produced at a small patera nested within the larger Tvashtar Paterae complex.|$|E
30|$|Depth {{below the}} surface and whether {{regenerative}} structures are located in organic layers or mineral soil directly affect the potential for lethal heating from the consumption of surface fuel (Miller 2000, Choczynska and Johnson 2009). Buried regenerative structures within duff or other organic soil layers {{are at greater risk}} from fire because these layers can be consumed by smoldering combustion. On sites that experienced higher soil temperatures at the mineral soil surface as a consequence of duff layer consumption, aspen (Populus sp.

500|$|In February 2008, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sean Gulick at the University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed.

[...] This was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring (the rocks found were <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the earths crust instead), the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Castillo Armas's army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with US-supplied planes. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas's victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The US propaganda campaign began well before the invasion, with the United States Information Agency writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America.
