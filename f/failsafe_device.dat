25|$|During the Annihilation War Thanos allies {{himself with}} the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen {{to check on the}} status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it {{encounters}} Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus's ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a <b>failsafe</b> <b>device</b> to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him. During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.|$|E
50|$|The coup {{installing}} Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri as ruler in al-Andalus {{in early}} 741 {{had been a}} <b>failsafe</b> <b>device.</b> But once {{the news of the}} disaster at Bagdoura spread, a general Berber uprising in al-Andalus could no longer be prevented. In October 741, Berber garrisons north of the Douro River mutinied. They discarded their Arab commanders and took to the field, abandoning their garrison posts to assemble their own Berber rebel army around the center and march against the Andalusian Arabs in the south.|$|E
5000|$|When {{they arrive}} at the {{location}} of the next TV set, Rickshaw orders one to kill the other. Charge tells Shadow that she needs to shoot him {{in a way that would}} make it seem as if he died, then he would find and kill Rickshaw while he was distracted monitoring her. She does, unwillingly, and heads out towards the [...] "Last Round". Meanwhile, Charge triangulates his position, then storms his hideout. Rickshaw, shocked to see him alive, is shot by Charge with a shotgun, but manages to activate a <b>failsafe</b> <b>device</b> right before he dies. Charge tells Shadow to head out of town, but she frees the civilians of the Last Round and then finds his map, where he had marked Rickshaw's location. She finds him and helps him to his feet, and they leave the hideout as the timer counts down, with little more than a minute left.|$|E

50|$|The next picture {{shows the}} two {{overheat}} cutouts. The bimetal cutout (left) operates if the device overheats because the intake is blocked or the fan fails, and resets once the heater cools after the obstruction is removed. The thermal fuse (right) is a <b>failsafe</b> backup <b>device</b> that will disconnect the heating element permanently {{in case of}} extreme overheating causing risk of fire, usually because the bimetal switch fails to operate (e.g. due to its contacts welding together).|$|R
5000|$|Jane Foster and her Thor form {{appear in}} Avengers: Secret Wars, voiced by Erica Lindbeck. She first {{appears in the}} two-part episode [...] "Avengers No More" [...] as a cross-dimensional {{research}} intern working {{to find a way}} to return Iron Man to their reality ever since he was sent there to stop Ultron from taking over his body. The research at the sight of the Stark Expo is disrupted when Leader and his army of Humanoids attack where Leader makes off with the Arc Reactor prototype and the resulting damages will take Jane awhile to replace the equipment. After the Avengers are scattered across time and space by the Static Expander upon the rest of the Cabal activate the <b>device's</b> <b>failsafe,</b> Jane Foster states to Black Panther's group that she will work to find out where each member was sent.|$|R

5000|$|In {{absolute}} secrecy, {{humans have}} created a virus {{that is capable of}} killing only vampires while leaving humanity unharmed. The virus is made as a <b>failsafe</b> <b>device,</b> in case the plan to coexist between vampires and humans fails. Hidden in a veil of deceit, the elder vampire makes a cynical plan to eradicate humanity if they won't take the cure made from vampire blood and become vampire themselves. The vampire leader believed that as long as humans and vampires remain separate races, there will always be conflict and warfare. He forces the creator of the vampire virus to alter the nature of the virus, making it deadly to humans and not to vampires. The virus creator, Dr. Fleming, doesn't seem to need all that much coercion to make a human biological weapon, as he wanted immortality and the Elder vampire was all too happy to manipulate him. Dr. Fleming pulls a gun and tries to eliminate the police officers when they discover his collaboration with the vampire leader. The vampire leader kills Fleming to silence him when the plot starts to unravel.|$|E
