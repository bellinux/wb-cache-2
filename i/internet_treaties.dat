40|$|The Berne Convention 1971 Paris Act {{covered the}} right of {{communication}} to the public incompletely and imperfectly through a tangle of occasionally redundant or self-contradictory provisions on 2 ̆ 2 public performance; 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 communication to the public, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 public communication, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 broadcasting, 2 ̆ 2 {{and other forms of}} transmission. Worse, the scope of rights depended {{on the nature of the}} work, with musical and dramatic works receiving the broadest protection, and images the least; literary works, especially those adapted into cinematographic works, lying somewhere in between. The 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty rationalized and synthesized protection by establishing full coverage of the communication right for all protected works of authorship. The WCT also introduced a new designation, the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available to the public. 2 ̆ 2 This right corresponds to much communication of works over the Internet, whose users 2 ̆ 2 access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them 2 ̆ 2 (WCT art. 8). As the drafters of the WCT (and its companion 2 ̆ 2 <b>Internet</b> <b>treaty</b> 2 ̆ 2 the WIPO Performers 2 ̆ 7 and Phonograms Treaty, arts. 10 and 14) sought to modernize the Berne Convention to address new exploitations by means of new technologies, one might infer that the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available 2 ̆ 2 is something new and different, not previously within the Berne Convention minimum rights protected. Whether the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available 2 ̆ 2 is a reaffirmation or an enlargement, its actual scope remains to be ascertained. This Essay will explore the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 in the WCT and 2 ̆ 2 communication to the public 2 ̆ 2 in the Berne Convention by applying these concepts to several of the principal forms of communication over the Internet. How, for example, should one analyze communications to and from websites, or peer-to-peer exchanges, or email, under the Berne Convention? What, if anything, do the WIPO Treaties add to the analysis? Some of the WIPO Treaties 2 ̆ 7 provisions may fairly be deemed to reaffirm the scope of rights already present in the Berne Convention, while others clearly add new protections to the range of minimum rights. The WIPO Treaties have significantly expanded the subject matter coverage of the Berne Convention’s communication to the public right, filling in the kinds of blank spots that this Essay’s analysis exposes. The WIPO Treaties have also eliminated the disparate treatment of wired and wireless transmissions. The core concept of 2 ̆ 2 making available, 2 ̆ 2 however, can fairly be called neither a reaffirmation nor a novelty, for it resolves an ambiguity as to whether the old communication to the public rights accommodated or excluded 2 ̆ 2 pull technologies. 2 ̆ 2 This Essay has concluded that if Berne did not mandate the inclusion of recipient-initiated transmissions, neither did it preclude them. The right may have been incipient, but there was sufficient uncertainty to leave room for Member State interpretation. As a result, it is appropriate to mark the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right as a clarification. The text of article 8 of the WCT lends further support to this view of the communication to the public right because it encompasses the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right within the general exclusive right of communication to the public. As for the scope of the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right, not all forms of communication of works over the Internet come within its reach. Moreover, some of the excluded (or at best ambiguously covered) communications may be economically significant. This suggests that, despite the aim of the WIPO Treaties 2 ̆ 7 enactors to assure 2 ̆ 2 effective and uniform 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 protection of the rights of authors, 2 ̆ 2 technology may continue to outstrip the ingenuity of the drafters of multilateral instruments...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{right is}} a form of {{copyright}} to regulate the communication of works, performances, and phonograms on an interactive on-demand basis by wire or wireless means. China has introduced its 2006 Network Regulations to protect communication right from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) ’s infringement, with regard to ISP’s each functional role as content provider and non-content provider of access provider, host provider, and information location tool provider. This thesis will examine whether the Chinese protection of the communication right concerning ISP’s infringement is adequate to permit effective action against any infringement of the right, according to the WIPO Internet Treaties-standard. The method employed in this dissertation is to analyse the protection of the communication right with respect to five closely interrelated key issues that require elucidation in sequence, which are the framework of the right, the reproduction during the communication, the technical protection, the rules of limitations and exceptions, and the enforcement of the right. During each analysis, the relevant provisions of both the WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>Treaties</b> and Chinese Copyright Law will be analysed. Afterwards, a comparison between the relevant provisions will be made to examine whether the Chinese protection satisfies the minimum standard of the WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>Treaties.</b> As the WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>Treaties</b> do not define the extent of the concrete protection at a national level, a further analysis, which is based upon the study of the Chinese legal practice, will be made to examine whether the Chinese protection is adequate to permit effective action against ISP’s act of infringement of the right. After the analysis and comparison, this thesis will assert that the protection of the communication right concerning ISP’s infringement under Chinese Copyright Law still remains inadequate, due to the legislative disadvantages within the three-level copyright system. This thesis will identify those disadvantages, with respect to ISP’s different functional roles, and make a concrete proposal for legislative reform.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), the {{protection}} and enforceability of intellectual property rights will continue growing.

This paper argues that the impact of ACTA on Canadian copyright law would be noticeable; the proposed treaty would import into Canadian copyright law notions that are not in harmony with its purpose, provisions, and/or judicial interpretation. Further, the paper argues that ACTA will be foremost in mind in the ongoing reform to the Copyright Act; this means, if ACTA is concluded and the reform to the Canadian Copyright Act fails, another unfulfilled international promise will be added to the shoulder of Canadian copyright policy makers, like the one pertinent to the WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>Treaties...</b>|$|E

40|$|Should {{the moral}} rights of authors be {{protected}} in works {{of new technology}} that are characteristic of the ‘Digital Age’? This question has not been widely considered in international copyright developments. The major processes of internationalization in copyright law, including the Berne Convention, TRIPs Agreement, EU harmonization directives, and WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>Treaties,</b> all side-step the issue of moral rights in technological works. Instead, {{there appears to be}} a tacit consensus in the international community that moral rights are somehow inappropriate to technological creation — but this question has yet to be subjected to rigorous policy analysis. This paper examines the relevance of moral rights to two areas of new technology. First, it considers the applicability of moral rights to computer programs; secondly, it explores moral rights in new kinds of artistic works that make use of technological elements in their creation, performance, or exhibition. It suggests that some form of moral rights protection may well be appropriate to technological works. However, the moral right of the ‘Digital Age’ should not only reflect the special characteristics of technological creation; it should also accommodate the remarkable diversity of human creativity in the environment of new technology...|$|E

40|$|The main {{issues in}} this {{research}} include: first, what the legal issues and cases {{are related to the}} protection of copyright on internet? Second, how is the development of the copyright protection recently? Third, is the collaboration of law and technology as the model of copyright protection on internet? This research was conducted by using the normative legal method. The result of the research showed some conclusions: first, the presence of internet has brought a negative impact on the attitude and behavior of human. Such negative impact is reflected with the increasing cases of copyright infringement. Therefore, the issue of copyright protection on internet becomes one of crucial issues. Second, recently, the copyright protection on internet can be done through technology approach or legal approach. If these two approaches are conducted separately, then the copyright protection on internet is found very difficult to be realized. To realize the copyright protection, then the model of the collaboration between the technology approach and legal approach becomes something certain.

40|$|A {{review of}} two recent {{scholarly}} books on digital copyright law: The Copyright Wars: Three Centuries of Trans-Atlantic Battle by Peter Baldwin (Princeton, 2014), and Copyfight: The Global Politics of Digital Copyright Reform by Blayne Haggart (Univ. of Toronto, 2014). Both books are meticulously researched and carefully written, and each makes an excellent {{addition to the}} literature on copyright. Contrasting both titles in this joint review, however, helps to reveal a few respects in which each work is incomplete; indeed, at times each book reads as {{a critique of the}} other. Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s The Copyright Wars argues that modern debates over the proper scope of copyright represent echoes of still-unresolved conflicts that arose early in the 18 th century and have recurred in various forms ever since. The philosophical conflict between the 2 ̆ 2 author 2 ̆ 7 s rights 2 ̆ 2 ideology that came to predominate in Continental Europe and the 2 ̆ 2 copyright 2 ̆ 2 ideology that prevailed (until very recently) in the English-speaking nations, Baldwin argues, underlies many modern debates about the respective interests of creators and users of expressive works. On Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s reading, the internet era raises no truly novel issues, but merely puts a contemporary gloss on copyright 2 ̆ 7 s unending three-way struggle between authors, readers, and disseminators. Haggart 2 ̆ 7 s Copyfight eschews Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s long view in favor of a close look at copyright 2 ̆ 7 s very recent history, focusing on the implementation of the 1996 WIPO <b>Internet</b> <b>treaties</b> in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Haggart 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that the conventional portrayal of the United States as a hegemonic power in copyright has been overstated, and that the differing ways that the North American nations have implemented the 1996 WIPO treaties shows that smaller nations can and do exercise substantial autonomy in setting copyright policy. That autonomy can be, and increasingly is, used by smaller nations to set copyright rules that contradict the preferences of larger nations, an oppositional phenomenon that Haggart suggests will only grow in importance in this century. Although both books are outstanding, their very different perspectives occasionally produce a form of tunnel vision. Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s book features impressive historical depth, but fails adequately to address the unique challenges of contemporary technology to the law and the historically unprecedented obstacles that contemporary law raises to certain forms of socially valuable innovation. Haggart 2 ̆ 7 s book, in contrast, demonstrates a keen and nuanced appreciation of the contemporary copyright debate and the ways that international and domestic institutions have interacted to set policy during the past two decades, but fails to appreciate {{the ways in which the}} much lengthier course of historical development constrains future copyright policy-making. The review concludes by suggesting respects in which either book might serve as a guide to future copyright policy-making at the national and international level...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{libraries}} {{are seen}} as educational, cultural and information institutions {{that contribute to the}} growth of knowledge and democracy in a society. Their main task is to provide free access to information resources for their users who need information in their work, learning or recreation. Libraries support the development of active citizens and help individuals to form their opinion on a variety of topics. They offer equity in access to all categories of citizens and have to provide varied and diverse information which can be accessed and used by various means. The word information as used here is to be understood in its generic meaning encompassing all kinds of library materials and information resources, including works with copyrights. Author’s rights to exploit his/her work and be rewarded for it has been guaranteed in Croatia and in some other countries by the Constitution. This means that the author’s rights belong among the basic rights guaranteed to an individual and that this right is equal to the right of freedom of expression. Therefore, it is imperative that a proper balance is maintained in society between the rights of authors and the rights of individuals to obtain free access to the information they need. In the last few decades the interests of authors and right holders to protect their works has been strengthened and the copyright term extended. Strengthening of copyright legislation has been supported by the developed countries, since intellectual property has become a central feature of their economy. It has been claimed that one-quarter of the United States’ total exports rely on intellectual property rights. Intellectual property contributes to the international trade and has, since 1994, been regulated by an important international agreement known by its English acronym TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). However, developing countries complain that the present strict copyright legislation harms their ability for further development. The issue has recently been brought to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and WIPO has initiated a new Development Agenda programme, which should take care of the needs of the developing countries. Together with other non-governmental organizations and consumer groups IFLA is lobbying in WIPO for the adoption of an international set of exceptions and limitations for libraries which would allow libraries throughout the world {{to take care of the}} needs of their users. Apart from TRIPS there is a number of international conventions which regulate the field of intellectual property including the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Art Works, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Rome Convention. The WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograme Treaty, known as the <b>Internet</b> <b>treaties,</b> are of special significance for digital works. The EU Directive on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and neighbouring rights in the Information Society and other EU Directives which guide the national copyright legislation of European countries have been introduced and described in brief. A short outline of the development of copyright since its inception in the 18 th century till the present time has been provided. The main arguments for its introduction have been brought up and it has been emphasized that in spite of the great changes in the way intellectual works have been created, produced and distributed in the last few decades, the same arguments to justify copyright have been used up to the present. Copyright has been introduced as an enticement to authors which would encourage them to create new works. Following the technological changes in the production, distribution and use of intellectual property legislation has also been changing. The invention of phonograph, gramophone, cinema, radio and television, photocopiers, microfilm readers, and computers have instigated adaptations and changes in copyright legislation and the introduction of new neighbouring and other rights such as rights of performers, database producers, phonograph producers, and rights of organizations for radiodiffusion. An author’s work has been explained as an intellectual creation characterized by its originality and subjectivity. Originality pertains only to the form of the work and not to its idea or topic, which does not have to be original. The work should be an original expression of its author and not the imitation of another person’ s work. The work does not need to have an artistic or literary value to be protected by copyright legislation. Examples of various types of works which can be protected according to the Croatian Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act (2003) are enumerated and works which do not obtain protection, such as daily news, official publications and folk tales are mentioned. The concept of domaine public payant has been described. It has been emphasized that original and distinct titles of works have also been protected. The following chapter deals with an author’s rights which are classified as moral (personal) and economic rights. Moral rights are characteristic of the continental law system and comprise the right of disclosure, the right of attribution, the right of integrity and the right to withdraw or retract. Economic rights encompass an author’s right to allow the reproduction, distribution, rental, communication to the public, making available to the public and adaptation of his/her work for which s/he is entitled to remuneration. Neighbouring rights include the rights of performers, the rights of database producers, the rights of producers of sound and video recordings, and the rights of radio diffusion organizations on their programmes. Publishers have rights on their editions. When an author’s work is published a contract is signed between the publisher and the author. Examples of such contracts have been provided. The issue of copyright holders of works for hire has also been dealt with. Exceptions and limitations to copyright are dealt with in the next chapter. The three-step test of the Berne Convention is said to offer a common basis upon which national copyright laws can develop their own sets of exceptions and limitations. The Croatian Copyright Act has been modelled according to the EU Directive on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the Information society, but not all exemptions offered by the Directive have been adopted. Exceptions and limitations included in the Act, which are of interest for libraries and library users, include citation, private use, informing the public, a provision for persons with disabilities, a provision for posters and catalogues of exhibitions and auctions, a provision for libraries, archives and similar institutions and provisions concerning technological protection measures. Collective societies which represent authors, performers, etc. and help them realize their rights, have been described. Collective societies established in Croatia have been identified and their work described in brief. Various kinds of licences (click-on, shrink-wrap, volume, access, site, general public and creative commons) and licence agreements (licence to publish agreement) have been explained. The contribution of EBLIDA in helping librarians understand and handle licences has been acknowleged and the establishment of ECUP described. A separate chapter deals with the public lending right (PLR). The concept of PLR has been introduced in the Croatian Copyright Act, but has not yet been implemented in libraries. The different systems of PLR applied in various countries have been described and the pro and contra arguments given. IFLA position on PLR has been introduced. Libraries collect special types of material such as printed and recorded music, films, computer software, and databases. Basic copyright guidelines for librarians have been given. Digitisation is the topic of a separate chapter. It has been explained that digitisation is a process which consists of both reproduction and communication to the public. Cases in which libraries do not have to ask for authors’ permission, such as private use and preservation have been described. It has been shown that digitisation may also be allowed by licencing. The process of digitisation of library material has been explained step by step. Experience of libraries abroad in the digitisation of newspapers and journals has been described. Orphan works and out-of-print works are said to require a diligent search for the right holders. E-reserves as a special type of collections used by universities have been described and guidance on how to secure copyright clearance has been provided. The issue of copyright on the Web has been raised. It has been stated that the right of communication to the public includes the author’s right to display his/her work on a website. Linking, deep linking, inline linking, and framing have been described as acts that might cause copyright infringement. Conditions under which trademarks, logos and labels can be used as links have been identified. Rights to photographic works and images have been discussed. Advice on how to use the images of bookcovers and bookjackets for the library’s website has been given. Guidance has been provided regarding the use of screenshots in promoting library services or in e-learning and general instructions regarding the protection of works on the web have been given. Web 2. 0 services often apply Creative Commons licences. E-learning has been discussed because it includes the acts of reproduction, adaptation, distribution and communication to the public. Changes in legal deposit legislation starting in the nineties and related to the digital works and the use of technologically protected electronic publications in depositary libraries have also been discussed. It has been said that the harvesting of an Internet space has raised new issues related to copyright. A great number of personal data appearing on the Internet is likely to incite changes in the personal data protection legislation. Open access has been discussed, its historical development outlined and recent international initiatives supporting OA described. Initiatives in Croatia, such as making available all Croatian journals supported by the Ministry of Education and Science freely on the Web, have been mentioned. Copyright in works deposited in repositories of universities and research institutes has been explained and the practice in Croatian universities described. An example of an author’s permisssion to have his/her dissertation deposited in a university repository has been added. The last part of the book provides questions and answers that would hopefully allow librarians to obtain quick answers to FAQ...|$|E
