40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{location}} of input supply in a two country spatial economy. A duopoly supplies intermediate goods to a perfectly competitive consumer good industry that operates with a quadratic production function inspired in PENG, THISSE and WANG (2006). Since the consumer good is non-tradable, the downstream industry locates in both countries and {{can be viewed as}} made by a set of multinational firms. On the one hand joint location of the upstream firms is caused by a localization economy and by the intensity of the demand addressed to the industry. On the other hand production and transport costs of the input lead to dispersed locations by the upstream firms. If the input suppliers agglomerate, the neighboring <b>downstream</b> <b>plant</b> operates with a larger size that the distant one.

40|$|Contamination of {{downstream}} {{hydrogen production}} plants or other users of high-temperature heat {{is a concern}} of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project. Due to the high operating temperatures of the NGNP (850 - 900 C outlet temperature), tritium produced in the nuclear reactor can permeate through heat exchangers to reach the hydrogen production plant, where it can become incorporated into process chemicals or the hydrogen product. The concentration limit for tritium in the hydrogen product has not been established, but {{it is expected that}} any future limit on tritium concentration will be no higher than the air and water effluent limits established by the NRC and the EPA. A literature survey of tritium permeation barriers, capture systems, and mitigation measures is presented and technologies are identified that may reduce the movement of tritium to the <b>downstream</b> <b>plant.</b> Among tritium permeation barriers, oxide layers produced in-situ may provide the most suitable barriers, though {{it may be possible to}} use aluminized surfaces also. For tritium capture systems, the use of getters is recommended, and high-temperature hydride forming materials such as Ti, Zr, and Y are suggested. Tritium may also be converted to HTO in order to capture it on molecular sieves or getter materials. Counter-flow of hydrogen may reduce the flux of tritium through heat exchangers. Recommendations for research and development work are provided...|$|E

40|$|In the {{boreal forest}} of Alberta, oil {{exploration}} has brought roads into previously undisturbed areas. Peatlands cover vast {{areas of the}} boreal forest, transmit water across the landscape, provide habitat for wildlife, and store carbon sequestered from the atmosphere. Roads crossing peatlands is inevitable, and {{little is known about}} how roads impact plant communities, water chemistry, and water tables. Few studies of large fen complexes have been conducted in the continental boreal forest, nor have many investigated the impact of roads. Understanding the relationships between species, water chemistry, and microtopography provides insight into the nature of continental fens and how they respond to disturbance. I examined plant communities and water chemistry characteristics of an undisturbed fen and compared the data to nearby peatlands that were disturbed by mineral haul roads. This study determined the control study site was an acidic fen with a pH generally less than 4. 0 and four community types were recognized. Most of the complex was very wet, open, oligotrophic poor fen, with a treed, oligotrophic, species poor area extending between two water tracks. As the fen narrowed following its drainage, site type changed to mesotrophic poor fen, with mesotrophic rich fen communities in some marginal areas. The water table was very stable. The road sites showed signs of enriched water chemistry and changed plant communities within 50 meters of the road upstream. <b>Downstream</b> <b>plant</b> communities were less effected.

40|$|It {{is known}} that plant growth {{promoting}} bacteria (PGPB) elicit positive effects on plant growth and biomass yield. However, the actual mechanism behind the plant-PGPB interaction is poorly understood, and the literature is scarce regarding the thermochemical pretreatability and enzymatic degradability of biomass derived from PGPB-inoculated plants. Most recent transcriptional analyses of PGPB strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN inoculating potato in literature and Arabidopsis in our present study have revealed the expression of genes for ferritin and the biosynthesis and transport of siderophores (i. e. the molecules with high affinity for iron), respectively. The expression of such genes in the shoots of PsJN-inoculated plants prompted us to propose that PsJN-inoculation can improve the host plant’s iron uptake and accumulation, which facilitates the <b>downstream</b> <b>plant</b> biomass pretreatment and conversion to simple sugars. In this study, we employed B. phytofirmans PsJN to inoculate the Arabidopsis thaliana plants, and conducted the first investigation for its effects on the biomass yield, the anatomical organization of stems, the iron accumulation, and the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of harvested biomass. The {{results showed that the}} strain PsJN stimulated plant growth in the earlier period of plant development and enlarged the cell size of stem piths, and it also indeed enhanced the essential metals uptake and accumulation in host plants. Moreover, we found that the PsJN-inoculated plant biomass released more glucose and xylose after hot water pretreatment and subsequent co-saccharification, which provided a novel insight into development of lignocellulosic biofuels from renewable biomass resources...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{interest}} in the effects of global change on the metabolism, stoichiometry and cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems has motivated research on the export of organic carbon (OCE) from catchments. In this article, quantitative and functional features of the annual export rates of total, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC and DOC) were reviewed, and the stoichiometry of export (OC:N, OC:P and N:P) from 550 catchments worldwide was reported. TOC export ranged 2. 1 - 92, 474 kg C km- 2 year- 1, POC export ranged 0. 4 - 73, 979 kg C km- 2 year- 1 and DOC export ranged 1. 2 - 56, 946 kg C km- 2 year- 1. Exports of TOC and DOC were strongly linked, but POC export was unrelated to DOC. The DOC fraction comprised on average 73 ± 21 % of TOC export. The export rates of organic carbon were poorly related to those of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Discrete and continuous environmental variables failed to predict TOC export, but DOC export was influenced by discharge and catchment area worldwide. Models of OCE in different catchment types were controlled by different environmental variables; hydrological variables were generally better predictors of OCE than anthropogenic and soil variables. Elemental ratios of carbon export in most catchments were above the Redfield ratio, suggesting that phosphorus may become the limiting nutrient for <b>downstream</b> <b>plant</b> growth. These ratios were marginally related to environmental data. More detailed hydrological data, consideration of in-stream processes {{and the use of}} quasi-empirical dynamical models are advocated to improve our knowledge of OCE rates and those of other nutrients. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Ecosystem {{processes}} are fundamentally limited by nutrient availability, but {{the effects of}} nutrient limitation or co-limitation on key processes like root nutrient uptake and carbon (C) exudation into soils is relatively unknown. New paradigms of nutrient limitation suggest that colimitation by multiple nutrients is more common than single nutrient limitation, therefore the established view that ecosystem {{processes are}} limited by phosphosus (P) in lowland tropical forests on highly weathered soils ecosystems should be revisited. Rates of nutrient uptake are of particular importance because these govern <b>downstream</b> <b>plant</b> physiological processes like photosynthesis and basic metabolism. Also, nutrient uptake is directly linked to root C exudates, which are increasingly recognized as an important plant contribution to soil C pools. Here, we explored the effect of changes in nutrient availability on root nutrient uptake in a well-studied Panamanian forest, and linked nutrient uptake to C exudates. We used a long-term factorial nutrient fertilization experiment, and focused our study on a relatively abundant canopy tree species (Tegtragastris panamensis). We found a significant interacting effect of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) on root uptake rates for ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate. Nitrogen and K added in combination produced uptake rates indistinguishable from control plots, however, N or K added individually increased the uptake rates of all nutrients compared to control and NK plots. No significant effects of N or P addition were observed on root C exudation rates. These results suggest that increased N or K availability may accelerate N and P uptake rates by roots. These results support the growing literature indicating that most ecosystem processes in tropical forests are governed by the availability of multiple nutrients, with implications for understanding plant productivity in this biome...|$|E
40|$|The Poaceae or grass {{family is}} among the most land {{covering}} and rapidly regenerating plant families on the planet. Initial interests outlined in this dissertation were characterizing supina bluegrass and bermudagrass health promoting compounds (Chapter 1). Seedlings of both species contained abundant levels of phenolic compounds comparable or higher to phenolic-rich fruits and vegetables. Phenolic and flavonoid content changed significantly during the first month of growth, offering an abundant, renewable and novel nutraceutical resource. While investigating this, we also became interested in evaluating the fungicide azoxystrobin’s plant stress alleviation potential. Both problems were thus investigated tandemly, as antioxidant systems may play a large role in the azoxystrobin plant response. ^ Fungicides and plant growth regulators can impact plant growth outside of their effects on fungal pathogens. Strobilurins, such as azoxystrobin, are a relatively new class of fungicides that reduce respiration by inhibiting the mitochondrial protein cytochrome bc 1. Strobilurins are gaining interest in their ability to delay leaf senescence and preserve oxidative balance, which, in turn, can lead to increased yields for cereal grain crops, or increased greenness and quality of high input turfgrass stands. Although azoxystrobin is an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxygen uptake, information remains limited as to whether they are able to modify other mitochondrial constituents and what <b>downstream</b> <b>plant</b> effects occur. ^ Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-mIR) offers a high sample throughput method to comparatively and qualitatively evaluate the effects of exogenously added compounds in creeping bentgrass. After proving FT-mIR was a powerful tool for discriminating isolated and chemically treated mitochondria (Chapter 2), Ft-mIR was used to monitor significant biochemical changes in whole plants (Chapter 3). Collected data proved that azoxystrobin had a large impact on the metabolite profile of creeping bentgrass, affecting leaf tissue protein, lipid, polysaccharide, carbohydrate and DNA. ^ Lastly, phytohormone, phenolic, flavonoid and thiobarbituric acid reactive species content in fungicide-treated creeping bentgrass and bermudagrass was determined in the presence and absence of heat stress (Chapter 4). Results demonstrated that increased levels of cytokinins and phenolic components in heat stressed plants may contribute to increased thermo-tolerance and preserved plant health. ...|$|E

The state has two cascade schemes of hydro-electric plants one at Chambal river and the other at Narmada river. Narmada river at present has four main hydro plants in cascading mode starting from Bargi, Indira Sagar and Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh to Sardar Sarovar in the neighboring state of Gujrat. The installed capacities of 2810 MW of these hydro plants feed to the major portion of state’s electricity demand.

40|$|Many firms own links of {{production}} chains [...] i. e., they own both upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>plants</b> in vertically linked industries. We use broad-based yet detailed {{data from the}} economy’s goods-producing sectors to investigate the reasons for such vertical ownership. It does not appear that vertical ownership is usually used to facilitate transfers of goods along the production chain, as is often presumed. Shipments from firms’ upstream units to their downstream units are surprisingly low, relative to both the firms’ total upstream production and their downstream needs. Roughly one-third of upstream plants report no shipments to their firms’ downstream units. Half ship less than three percent of their output internally. We do find that manufacturing plants in vertical ownership structures have high measures of “type” (productivity, size, and capital intensity). These patterns primarily reflect selective sorting of high plant types into large firms; once we account for firm size, vertical structure per se matters much less. We propose an alternative explanation for vertical ownership {{that is consistent with}} these results. Namely, that rather than moderating goods transfers down production chains, it instead allows more efficient transfers of intangible inputs (e. g., managerial oversight) within the firm. We document some suggestive evidence of this mechanism. ...|$|R
