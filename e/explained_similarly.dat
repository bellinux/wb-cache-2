Size, liquidity and GDP growth was found to have significant relationship with profitability of both Conventional and Islamic banks whereas credit risk and interest rate risk have a significant negative relationship with profitability. What is surprising is that overhead appears to have contradictory relationship for Conventional and Islamic banks and that there is a negative significant relationship between performance and inflation...|$|R

5000|$|This {{physical}} force he called extension, and described it, at first, as a substance, {{in the sense}} just <b>explained.</b> <b>Similarly,</b> he could not understand the various dependent, transient mental experiences with which we are familiar without assuming {{the reality of a}} self-existing, infinite and eternal consciousness, mental force, or mind-energy, which expresses itself in all these finite experiences of perceiving and understanding, of feeling and striving. This consciousness or mind-energy he called thought, and described it also, at first, as a substance. Each of these [...] "substances" [...] he regarded as infinite of its kind (that is, as exhaustive of all the events of its own kind), and as irreducible to the other, or any other, substance. But in view of the intimate way in which Extension and Thought express themselves conjointly in the life of man, Spinoza considered it necessary to conceive of Extension and Thought not as detached realities, but as constituting one organic whole or system. And in order to express this idea, he then described Extension and Thought as attributes, reserving the term Substance for the system which they constitute between them. This change of description was not intended to deny that Extension and Thought are substances in the sense of being self-existent, etc. It was only intended to express their coherence in one system. The system of course would be more than any one attribute. For each attribute is only infinite of its kind; the system of all attributes is absolutely infinite, that is, exhausts the whole of reality. Spinoza, accordingly, now restricted the term [...] "substance" [...] to the complete system, though he occasionally continued to use the phrase [...] "substance or attribute", or described Extension as a substance.|$|E

40|$|Indigenous {{amino acids}} have been {{detected}} {{in a number of}} meteorites, over 70 in the Murchison meteorite alone. It has been generally accepted that the amino acids in meteorites formed in liquid water on an asteroid or comet parent-body. However, the water in the Murchison meteorite, for example, was depleted of deuterium, making the distribution of deuterium in organic acids in Murchison difficult to <b>explain.</b> <b>Similarly,</b> occasional but consistent meteoritic biases for non-terrestrial L amino acids cannot be reasonably rationalized by liquid water parent-body reactions. We will present the results of a laboratory demonstration showing that the amino acids glycine, alanine, and serine should result from the UV (ultraviolet) photolysis of interstellar ice grains. This suggests that some meteoritic amino acids {{may be the result of}} interstellar ice photochemistry, rather than having formed by reactions in liquid water. We will describe some of the potential implications of these findings for the organic materials found in primitive meteorites, in particular how interstellar ice synthesis might more easily accommodate the presence and distribution of deuterium, and the meteoritic bias for L amino acids...|$|R

40|$|The youth self-report (YSR), {{which is}} {{theoretically}} {{based in the}} field of developmental psychopathology and follows a dimensional approach, is an important instrument to assess the behavioral and emotional problems and the psychosocial competencies of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 years in both clinical and research contexts. Our main aims were to propose a short form of the YSR, conduct a first validation study, and compare the short-form YSR with the full version of the Portuguese YSR. We conducted the first study (Study 1) in a sample of 1, 266 Portuguese community adolescents between the ages of 11 and 21 years to analyze the factor structure of the YSR. We conducted the second study (Study 2) in a sample of 302 community adolescents between the ages of 11 and 21 years to validate the factor structure of the short form of the YSR, which consisted of 33 items that focused on the dimensions of internalization-depression, internalization-anxiety, externalization-destructiveness and externalization-exhibitionism.

Since all the points in the region R_ 1 have been sorted in the ascending order of x coordinates, thus x_P > x_Pi; and if y_Pi is larger than y_P, then the point P must be located in the shaded triangular area; and obviously it also falls in the triangle formed by three points P_i, P_miny, and P_minx.

40|$|This paper {{primarily}} {{deals with}} improving the computational {{efficiency of the}} continuation small signal stability analysis of a microgrid. The continuation (or iterative) small signal stability analysis is required to carry out control parameter tuning based upon the system level study. In specific, tuning of droop coefficients and current feed-forward loop gains of voltage controllers in an islanded microgrid is addressed. A generalized system configuration with non-identical sources and arbitrary load placements is considered. The construction of the system state matrix for such generalized configuration is <b>explained.</b> <b>Similarly</b> to the existing approaches, the continuation small signal stability analysis is performed through exhaustive enumerations. However, the system state matrix is initially decomposed into components {{in the form of}} the coefficients of parameters to be tuned. Therefore, there is no need to entirely reconstruct the system matrix at each iteration. The computation time requirement can be further reduced by deploying the sparsity of each matrix component. A clear rule is also established for the tuning of multiple parameters. The effectiveness of the methodology proposed is verified through a detailed case study...|$|E
40|$|Independent {{component}} and {{canonical correlation}} analysis are two general-purpose statistical methods with wide applicability. In neuroscience, independent component analysis of chromatic natural images explains the spatio-chromatic structure of primary cortical receptive fields {{in terms of}} properties of the visual environment. Canonical correlation analysis <b>explains</b> <b>similarly</b> chromatic adaptation to different illuminations. But, as we show in this paper, neither of the two methods generalizes well to explain both spatio-chromatic processing and adaptation at the same time. We propose a statistical method which combines the desirable properties of independent component and canonical correlation analysis: It finds independent components in each data set which, across the two data sets, are {{related to each other}} via linear or higher-order correlations. The new method is as widely applicable as canonical correlation analysis, and also to more than two data sets. We call it higher-order canonical correlation analysis. When applied to chromatic natural images, we found that it provides a single (unified) statistical framework which accounts for both spatio-chromatic processing and adaptation. Filters with spatio-chromatic tuning properties as in the primary visual cortex emerged and corresponding-colors psychophysics was reproduced reasonably well. We used the new method to make a theory-driven testable prediction on how the neural response to colored patterns should change when the illumination changes. We predict shifts in the responses which are comparable to the shifts reported for chromatic contrast habituation...|$|R
