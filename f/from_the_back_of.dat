5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a M-21 carrier aircraft, {{a variant of the}} Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Sooners {{adopted a}} {{different}} jersey design in 2006, {{which included the}} removal of the players' last names <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the jersey due to the design of the uniform's shoulders and back, and a darker crimson color for the jersey and helmet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E

5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> {{the grid}} to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He {{finished}} off the season finishing fourth in Japan {{and third in}} Australia, {{but it was not}} enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit. As of 2017 (the full Grand Prix track has not been used since 2000), Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780km (2.349mi) long track still stands.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Company H {{attempted}} to deploy at five-yard intervals {{along the ridge}} while still mounted. This proved disastrous, since the horses were flighty and the troop inexperienced and unable to shoot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their terrified horses.|$|R

5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} pharyngeal arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the embryo towards {{the front of the}} face and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch closest {{to the head of the}} embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the grid due {{to a number of}} {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him {{on the wrong side of}} the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, the {{remaining}} Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when {{the daughter of}} guitarist The Edge fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting the crew to request additional wide shots <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour was on its fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice core sample {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E

5|$|The British No. 1 {{sustained}} {{tendon damage}} {{during his first}} round match at the German Open in Hamburg. Murray was up 5–1 when he hit a forehand <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the court and snapped the tendons in his wrist, leaving him out of action from 15 May until 7 August, thereby missing Wimbledon. During this rest period, Murray rose to world No. 8, but by 7 August, he had dropped to no 14.|$|E
5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings {{have been described as}} something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
50|$|S-5, {{along with}} S-8 and S-13 rockets, have been {{deployed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> pick-up trucks (generally, technicals) during the 2011 Libyan civil war, serving as a makeshift MLRS. The rebels have also developed a man-portable launcher for the S-5, turning the rocket into a makeshift RPG round.|$|R

5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers {{similar to those of}} other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|While on foot patrol, Police Constable Don Ross (Anthony Oliver) chances upon {{a gang of}} lorry hijackers {{operating}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a transport café. After seeing Diamond (George Murcell) and Johnny (David Graham) {{drive off}} {{in a car with}} the manageress, Connie Williams (Miriam Karlin), apparently being held hostage in the back seat, Ross jumps onto and clings to the vehicle's side; however, he is quickly thrown into the road, suffering a head injury. Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
