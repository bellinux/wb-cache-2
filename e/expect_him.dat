McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to live more than a week.

25|$|Chairman Chris Grant added: “To {{beat the}} {{attention}} of opposition counties to the signature of a standout overseas player in Rana Naved is a massive coup for the club. “Rana {{has proved to be}} a charismatic character and an inspirational performer in Twenty20 cricket around the world, as well as boasting exceptional pedigree at one-day international level with Pakistan. “Not only do I <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to help us win matches, he is also a very entertaining player to watch.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, under Boras's supervision, {{high school}} {{prospect}} Landon Powell earned his GED following {{his junior year}} of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to be draft eligible, making him a free agent. Whether because of Powell's ability, his pricetag, or internal resentment within Major League Baseball about his successful end-run around the draft, Powell did not sign, instead enrolling at the University of South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E

25|$|One rainy night, {{the girls}} are waiting for Tatsuo's bus and grow worried when he doesn't arrive on the bus they <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> on. As they wait, Mei {{eventually}} falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see {{him for the first}} time. He has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken along for her father. Totoro is delighted at both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds. A bus-shaped giant cat halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.|$|E
500|$|Gregg Doyel, {{national}} {{columnist for}} CBSSports.com, proclaimed Robinson the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy: [...] "Denard Robinson {{has earned the}} right to pole position in the Heisman race.

500|$|At Christmas 1894, the Munshi sent Lord Elgin {{a sentimental}} {{greeting}} card, which to Victoria's dismay went unacknowledged.

500|$|He {{initially}} {{supported the}} War in Afghanistan, but {{has become increasingly}} skeptical of the war. In June 2010 he pushed a funding amendment which would require President Barack Obama to provide for a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. [...] "Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that quite frankly {{is going to lead}} us nowhere," [...] said McGovern.

500|$|Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, {{though they}} did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to play shortstop at the {{professional}} level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough {{to allow him to}} play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said [...] "where I play [...] isn't a big concern for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and it will all work out." ...|$|E

500|$|MacInnis {{left home}} in 1979 {{to join the}} Regina Pat Blues of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). He {{appeared}} in 59games, scoring 20goals and 48points with the Pat Blues, and appeared in two Western Hockey League (WHL) games with the Regina Pats. He then moved to Ontario and joined the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).

He was selected by the Calgary Flames in the first round, 15th overall.

500|$|Jon Povill wrote {{up a list}} of {{possible}} directors for the project, which included Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time or unwilling to work with a $7.5 million budget. Although his agent did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to do it, Philip Kaufman signed on to direct. Roddenberry introduced him to the series by showing him ten episodes, including those he felt were the most representative and popular of the series: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". On signing, Kaufman was pleased to direct Star Trek. He discussed it with Lucas, and said that he [...] "felt he could go through the roof".

500|$|In 1996 Dibnah {{repaired}} the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge—the same chimney he had scaled for a bet, in his youth. [...] He {{was also}} asked to install a peregrine falcon nest at the top. [...] He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. [...] As a notable raconteur he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. [...] He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs, but the strain of living with a man so dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: [...] "Sometimes he'll have busted his thumb because he's hit it with a hammer; you couldn't really <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> then {{to come in and}} start doing things in the house. [...] I just don't think it's fair though, I think you've got to strike a balance and I think ours is about 90/10. [...] Me for 90 per cent of the housework and Fred for 10." [...] Susan met another man and moved out, taking Roger with her and leaving Jack with Fred.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and <b>expect</b> <b>Him</b> to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote, [...] "The best of {{the group}} is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a {{spectacular}} player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov." [...] NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union {{to play in the}} NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Khalarmov. Edmonton Oilers' scout Barry Fraser commented, [...] "From what I've seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he's quick, real quick, small and very exciting. He may be the top player in this year's draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don't analyze him the same way as a kid from the West... I don't <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> to go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect." ...|$|E
