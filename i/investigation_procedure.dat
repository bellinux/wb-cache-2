50|$|Mr. Big (sometimes {{known as}} the “Canadian technique”) is a covert <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> used by {{undercover}} police to elicit confessions from suspects in cold cases (usually murder). Police officers create a fictitious criminal organization and then seduce the suspect into joining it. They build a “relationship” with the suspect, gain his confidence, and then enlist his help in a succession of criminal acts (e.g., credit card scams, selling guns). Once the suspect has become enmeshed in the criminal gang he is persuaded to divulge information about the specific crime under investigation.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited {{directly in the}} hair. For this reason the <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however {{with the benefit of}} modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).|$|E

Keric had been told by the chief of the SUP Criminal Investigations Division that the bodies were those of civilians, men and women, from a sunken truck with no license plates. They were all highly decomposed and Keric was told they could not be identified. He claimed that Djordjevic ordered him to bury the bodies near the lake without notifying local legal officials or carrying out the standard scene of crime <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Djordjevic's defence maintained that Keric decided to carry out the burials himself, not on Djordjevic's orders.|$|E

5000|$|The {{challenge}} Compton faced was {{to establish}} the Office {{in the face of}} considerable public scepticism about its efficacy. The media described the Office as pointless and ludicrously emasculated and Compton as a swordless crusader. [...] Compton busied himself recruiting staff during 1966 and 1967 and formulated the structure and operating procedures of the Office. He drew upon his previous experience, using the Exchequer and Audit Department of the Treasury as a model. Staff were borrowed from other departments and legal advice procured from the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Compton sought civil servants with enquiring minds and the ability to size up cases and people rather than the ability to organise or to plan. [...] Compton also pioneered an <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> that was to remain unchanged for thirty years and was unique among Ombudsman schemes. The procedure involved a ten part jurisdiction test of complaints, a two-stage investigation process and a final reporting stage.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-8/13, Abelia, the Court {{dismissed}} {{an action}} brought by Abelia, a trade and employers association {{that is part}} of Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon (“NHO”), the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The applicant sought the annulment of ESA Decision No 160/13/COL of 24 April 2013 where ESA concluded, without initiating the formal <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure,</b> that the contested provisions of the Norwegian VAT Act and VAT Compensation Act did not have the effect of granting State aid, within the meaning of Article 61(1) EEA, to public schools or the lessors of premises to public schools. Besides the applicant’s legal interest in bringing the action for annulment, which led to the dismissal, the Court {{had to deal with the}} situation of the applicant’s counsel in light of Article 17(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which parties other than any EFTA State, ESA, the European Union and the Commission must be represented by a lawyer. The Court examined the relationship between the applicant and the two lawyers that signed the application. The independence of one lawyer was not found to be affected by her position as head of the Business Legislation Department of NHO as the Court had not been provided with information demonstrating that the interests of NHO were largely the same as those of the applicant. The other lawyer was also deemed sufficiently independent from the applicant as an employee of an independent law firm, from where she continued to receive her salary, regardless of a contract between NHO and the law firm for the temporary provision of her services. The applicant was thus found to be properly represented before the Court, showing that the right of audience of in-house counsel must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

30|$|The general {{complexity}} of the Vasa warship can be mainly attributed to large variations in Vasa oak; {{not only to the}} natural variability of the wood but also to the surface degradation, chemical treatment and the disintegration of the cell-wall structure originating from centuries of waterlogged conditions.

A well-defined <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> in three main steps therefore has to be applied in the evaluation of the mechanical properties, as described in this paper.|$|E
