5000|$|A {{remainder}} is vested if (1) {{the remainder}} {{is given to}} a presently existing and ascertained person, and (2) it {{is not subject to}} a condition precedent. A vested remainder may be <b>indefeasibly</b> <b>vested,</b> meaning that it is certain to become possessory in the future, and cannot be divested. An example, O conveys to [...] "A for life, then to B and B's heirs." [...] B has an [...] "indefeasibly vested remainder" [...] certain to become possessory upon termination of A's life estate. B or B's heirs will clearly be entitled to possession upon A’s death. A vested remainder may not be certain to become possessory. An example of this: O conveys [...] "to A for life, then to A's children." [...] A has one child, B, so B has a vested remainder because B is ascertainable. But, A may have no other children in his life, and B could die before A, so the vested remainder is not certain to become possessory. Instead B is said to have a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> subject to partial (more children) and complete divestment (if B dies before A).|$|R
50|$|Various {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> on attitude strengths. In one such study, Crano and Sivacek visited a university in Michigan and gathered the results of a proposed drinking-age referendum. The referendum sought to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. The respondents were divided into three categories: 1. high <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who would be significantly and immediately affected as a result of the referendum), 2. low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who would be unaffected by the law change at the time of its inception), and 3. moderate <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who fell between the first two extremes). Although 80% of the subjects were opposed to the referendum, their respective levels of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> clearly indicated that the strength of their attitudes significantly affected their resultant behaviors. Half of the highly <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups joined the anti-referendum campaign, but only a quarter of the moderately <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> group and an eighth of the low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> group joined the campaign. These results support Crano's theory of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and reinforce the implications and considerations of stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy discussed above. It also proves the correlation between <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and action, based on what level of involvement the three types of students were willing to participate in.|$|R
40|$|The <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> {{construct}} {{suggests that}} people act in attitudinally consistent ways on important issues of high hedonic relevance. Accordingly, vested individuals should endorse policies {{consistent with their}} attitudes. Symbolic politics holds self-interest unrelated to attitude and thus of little use. Three secondary analyses of national election data assessed the predictive utility of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> on policy-related issues. Consistent with expectations, Analysis 1 found <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> to be unrelated to policy endorsement. However, Analysis 2 disclosed that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> significantly moderated attitude–endorsement consistency on beliefs regarding busing, health insurance, and government-guaranteed living standards. Analysis 3 investigated <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> effects across three national election surveys and six policy issues. Without exception, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> significantly moderated the relationship between attitudes and policy endorsement. These results, obtained across {{a broad range of}} topics and respondents, suggest that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> is an important moderator of consistency between attitudes and policy endorsement. © 2001 Elsevier Science (USA) Coinciding with the development of dual process models of attitude change in social psychology is the complementary consideration of the effect of personal relevance on the behavioral expression of attitudes and on attitude–criterio...|$|R

50|$|Crano {{conducted}} {{another study}} {{to prove that}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> may affect people's belief {{that a majority of}} a population will support their attitude on an issue. This bias is known as false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect. Under the guise of a public opinion survey, Crano created high and low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups by identifying whether upper- or lower-classmen would pay a surcharge to subsidize lost funding from the government. The class who was selected to pay the surcharge had a high degree of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> while the student body not required to pay exhibited a lower degree of <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b> The study then determined the participants estimate of what percentage of the student body would support their beliefs regardless of impact. Crano found that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> influenced assumed consensus and students believed {{that a majority of the}} university's population would support their plight even though only half would be affected.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondents}} were grouped {{into the same}} three categories as the drinking age study: high, moderate, and low <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b> The study found that those with {{the highest levels of}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> were significantly more inclined to take action based on their attitudes concerning the issue; that is, their resultant behaviors (signing the petition, joining the group, pledging multiple hours with the group) occurred much more consistently and prevalently than that of the other two <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups.|$|R
5000|$|There are two philosophies {{about the}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> of the {{inspectors}} {{in the product}} under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the projectwho {{do not have a}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team.|$|R
50|$|The {{factor to}} {{consider}} with <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and its application towards attitude-consistent actions is attitude importance. Attitude (or issue) importance concerns not only matters of personal consequence, but also matters of national or international interest. While {{both of these}} can fall in line with each other, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and attitude importance are not the same. For example, consider the plight of an African nation that has been ravaged by an influenza epidemic. Although an individual in America may consider this objectively important, because of the low probability of personal consequence—i.e., <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> — his resultant behavior may not be indicative of his attitude towards the epidemic. In other words, since the issue is of little hedonic relevance to the perceiver, the amount of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> is low, and is therefore unlikely to produce attitude-consistent actions. Geographic distance and cultural differences are also a factor in attitude importance. Tragic circumstances {{halfway around the world}} or shocking behaviors by members of a culture different from the perceiver, will most likely never result in attitude change. The physical distance or cultural difference of an occurrence directly correlates to the <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> of the perceiver. Things too far away or customs perceived to be too strange will almost never trigger a <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Vested</b> <b>interest</b> theory (VIT), first {{investigated}} {{on environmental}} risk, {{suggests that the}} hedonic relevance of an attitude object moderates relations between attitudes, intentions, and responses to danger. Emphasizing <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> may maximize impacts of risk communications. Study 1 (N= 215) assessed differences between inhabitants of two flood-risk areas in Italy on past experience, risk perceptions, concerns, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Objectively, higher risk areas' residents reported more experience, and greater perceived risk and concern, while no preparedness differences were found (both at "between cities" and "within city" levels). Study 2 (N= 444) looked at the moderating role of VIT-based risk communication messages {{on the relationship between}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and behavioral intentions. Components of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> moderate attitude-intention consistency, suggesting a new method of developing effective risk announcements. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|This paper recognizes <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> {{as one of}} {{the primary}} {{premises}} that reduce the effectiveness of privatization policy, stall its momentum and produce structural problems in the long-run. Both exogenous and endogenous drawbacks are cited, but the main focus is put on the dynamism of vested interests’ character, interconnectedness and evolution. Policy makers have been long aware of the existence of activities rooted in <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> including empire building behaviors, creation of sinecures or extravagant management style. Hence, the fundamental effort here is put on the identification of emerging <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> that were typically not considered by scholars. The channels through which conventional <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> have snowballed over time are emphasized. This includes casting a closer glance at family employment, as well as at sports sponsorship arrangements, which emerge as the favorite domain of marketing activity for Polish state-owned enterprises. The research of available literature is performed, along with its application to the Polish case, and insightful observations concerning the anatomy of privatization-related reluctance.

5000|$|The concept called <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> by Crano {{is called}} self-interest by Sears (1997). It seems that [...] "self-interest" [...] {{is the more}} widely {{recognized}} term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> involves perceived personal consequences (p. 490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything [...] "strong" [...] is [...] "salient".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vested</b> <b>{{interest}}</b> is {{the special}} interest in an existing system, arrangement, or institution for particular personal reasons, is a communication theory that seeks to explain how influences affect behavior. As defined by William Crano, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> refers to the amount that an attitude object is deemed ally relevant by the attitude holder. In Crano's theory of <b>vested</b> <b>interest,</b> he states that [...] "an attitude object that has important perceived personal consequences for the individual will be perceived as highly vested. Highly vested attitudes will be functionally related to behavior". Simply put, when people have more at stake with {{the result of an}} object (like a law or policy) that will greatly affect them, they will behave {{in a way that will}} directly support or defy the object for the sake of their own self-interest.|$|R

40|$|In social interactions, {{individuals}} may sometimes {{pursue their own}} interests {{at the expense of}} their interaction partner. Such self-interested behaviors impose a threat to the interaction partner’s freedom to act. The current article investigates this threat in the context of interdependence and reactance theory. We explore how <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> influence reactance process stages of an advisor-client interaction. We aim to explore the interactional process that evolves. In two studies, participants took the perspective of a doctor (advisor) or a patient (client). In both studies we incorporated a <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b> In Study 1 (N= 82) we found that in response to a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> of their interaction partner, patients indicated a stronger experience of reactance, more aggressive behavioral intentions, and more biased cognitions than doctors. A serial multiple mediation revealed that a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> engendered mistrust toward the interaction partner and this mistrust led to an emerging reactance process. Study 2 (N= 207) further demonstrated that doctors expressed their reactance in a subtle way: They revealed a classic confirmation bias when searching for additional information on their preliminary decision preference, indicating stronger defense motivation. We discuss how these findings can help us to understand how social interactions develop dynamically...|$|R
