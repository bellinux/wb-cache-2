50|$|The LST {{proved to}} be a remarkably {{versatile}} ship. A number of them were converted to become landing craft repair ships (ARL). In this design, the bow ramp and doors were removed, and the bow was sealed. <b>Derricks,</b> <b>booms,</b> and winches were added to haul damaged landing craft on board for repairs, and blacksmith, machine, and electrical workshops were provided on the main deck and tank deck.|$|R
50|$|Two graving docks at Hunter's Point {{that could}} {{accommodate}} the largest ocean-going vessels, five floating drydocks, eight marine railways, four shearleg derricks and ten floating <b>boom</b> <b>derricks</b> were available.|$|R
25|$|On 10 August the {{engineers}} {{working on the}} Cherbourg quays saw {{a new kind of}} ship steaming into the harbor. She was the Junior N. Van Noy, the first engineer port repair ship sent overseas. A converted Great Lakes steamer displacing only 3,000 tons, the ship had machine shops, storage bins, and heavy salvage equipment aboard. Her decks bristled with <b>derricks</b> and <b>booms</b> for lifting sunken ships and other debris. Manning the ship was the sixty-member 1071st Engineer Port Repair Ship Crew.|$|R
50|$|A Chicago <b>boom</b> <b>derrick</b> is a <b>derrick</b> with a <b>boom</b> {{which is}} {{attached}} to an external structure. The external upright member of the structure serves as the mast, and the boom is stepped in a fixed socket clamped to the upright. The boom is connected to at least three pulley systems to control {{the position of the}} boom. For example, a pulley system is connected {{to the top of the}} boom and the higher area of the external structure and two pulley systems near the top of the boom connected on either side of the boom to the external structure. The position of the top of the boom can be controlled by manipulating these pulley systems. The load is lifted from a separate pulley system that is connected to the top of the boom.|$|R
50|$|Junior Van Noy sailed for the European Theater in late July 1944 from Halifax in Convoy number HXS300 {{arriving}} in August. The {{arrival of the}} ship is noted in The Corps of Engineers: The War Against Germany: CHAPTER XVI Developing Beaches and Reconstructing Ports:On 10 August the engineers working on the Cherbourg quays saw {{a new kind of}} ship steaming into the harbor. She was the Junior N. Van Noy, the first engineer port repair ship sent overseas. A converted Great Lakes steamer displacing only 3,000 tons, the ship had machine shops, storage bins, and heavy salvage equipment aboard. Her decks bristled with <b>derricks</b> and <b>booms</b> for lifting sunken ships and other debris. Manning the ship was the sixty-member 1071st Engineer Port Repair Ship Crew.|$|R
50|$|A {{breast derrick}} is a <b>derrick</b> without a <b>boom</b> with a mast {{constructed}} from two upright members. The upright members are more spread at their bottom ends than their top ends. There are crossbars {{to join the}} two members from the bottom to the top to form a mast. Without the use of boom, the top crossbar {{is also used to}} connect to a sheave or a block that is used for lifting the load. The mast is prevented from tipping forward by guys connected to its top.|$|R
50|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, {{a method}} for delivering supplies to the point had to be developed. Due {{to the lack of}} good roads from the Nawiliwili harbor, {{the decision was made to}} bring the materials in by sea.The lighthouse tender Kukui would anchor offshore and then dispatch small boats with supplies to a cove near the point. Since there was no beach landing, the boats would anchor to cleats cemented into the lava rocks at the point. A <b>boom</b> <b>derrick,</b> constructed on a ledge above the water, would pluck the supplies from the boats and place them on a loading platform 110 ft above the water.|$|R
50|$|Gin {{pole derrick}} (also known as {{standing}} derrick or pole derrick) is a <b>derrick</b> without a <b>boom</b> with single tower or mast supported by 4 guy wires (two side guys, fore guy and rear guy). Its guys are so arranged from its top as to permit leaning the mast in any direction. The {{base of the}} tower is hinged {{and the top of}} the tower is connected to a pulley system for load lifting. As this is a simple derrick system, it is considered to be used by some agencies as an improvised rescue derrick in an emergency situation where no suitable rescue derrick or crane is available.|$|R
50|$|The Stiffleg derrick, {{also known}} as a Scotch derrick, is a <b>derrick</b> with a <b>boom</b> similar to a guy derrick, but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of {{resisting}} either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the sills behind the stifflegs in heavy load lifting. Stiffleg derrick on a vessel is called a floating stiffleg derrick. Derricks are especially useful for high rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to the street/pedestrian traffic is a concern.|$|R
50|$|A basket derrick is a <b>derrick</b> {{without a}} <b>boom</b> that is {{supported}} by a rope-and-pole system that forms a basket. The basket is constructed from a group of poles to form a polygon. There are crossbars between the pole members to strengthen their support. The supporting ropes are tied {{to the top of the}} basket poles on one end and joined together on the other end at a lower elevation than the top of the basket poles to form the base for the derrick tower. The derrick tower can be a mast or a post with the bottom hinged at the base where all ropes meet. The top of the tower is secured with multiple reeved guys to position the top of the tower to the desired location by varying the length of the upper guy lines. The load is lifted using a pulley system connected to the top of the tower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{headquarters}} of M. D. Moody was first established at ACL Warehouse No. 2 Riverside Viaduct in 1913 until 1951. In 1951 M.D. Moody moved to 4652 Philips Highway and became incorporated as M. D. Moody & Sons, Inc. The company {{was one of}} the world’s largest crane dealers, both in units sold and in its rental fleet that included crawler cranes, rough terrain cranes, hydraulic truck cranes, <b>derricks,</b> and lattice <b>boom</b> cranes. The fleet ranged in sizes up to 450 ST. The firm has provided cranes for some of Florida’s biggest lifts and road and bridge construction across the southeast. M.D. Moody & Sons, Inc. was a Terex dealer for the southeast region of distribution as well as American Hoist & Derrick. Along with distributing heavy equipment there was also a parts department for a variety of cranes and heavy construction equipment. The parts department of M. D. Moody is currently owned by MOBRO Marine, Inc..|$|R
50|$|Guy derrick (also {{known as}} <b>boom</b> <b>derrick)</b> is a fixed guyed mast derrick {{that can be}} rotated and {{connected}} to a boom. The mast is in upright position with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not to be lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of the boom. The boom extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of the boom is a pulley system that {{is connected to the}} top of the mast to control how far the boom is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, the connected boom is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected {{to the top of the}} boom. In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the mast is fixed without being rotated, but the boom can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of the boom with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of the boom to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of the boom is lashed to secure them together. Another lashing is between the fork area and the mast at a higher position to support the weight of the boom. The fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of the boom is rested on the mast without permanently fixed to it. The fork prevent the boom to come off the mast while swinging up to 180 degrees.|$|R
