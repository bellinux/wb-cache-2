5|$|In the 20th century, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{led to the}} consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there.

25|$|Iceland already {{converts}} its {{surplus electricity}} into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, {{primarily for the}} production of ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% of the cost of ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it. Iceland is also developing an aluminium-smelting industry. Aluminium costs are driven primarily by the cost of the electricity to run the smelters. Either of these industries could effectively export all of Iceland's potential <b>geothermal</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and <b>geothermal)</b> and national <b>electricity</b> usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|R
25|$|The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims {{to improve}} air {{quality in the}} US and reduce {{dependence}} on foreign oil supplies. There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes by 2020. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, <b>geothermal</b> <b>electricity</b> and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{renewable}} power {{sources such as}} wind and solar, geothermal energy is dispatchable, meaning that it is both available whenever needed, and can quickly adjust output to match demand. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), {{of all types of}} new electrical generation plants, geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor, a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity. The EIA rates new geothermal plants as having a 92% capacity factor, comparable to those of nuclear (90%), and higher than gas (87%), or coal (85%), and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind (34%) or solar photovoltaic (25%). While the carrier medium for <b>geothermal</b> <b>electricity</b> (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available, for most intents and purposes, indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} geothermal energy and other energy sources in Turkey. Turkey's primary energy consumption is about 64 Â Mtoe in 2003, mostly provided by fossil fuels (74. 7 %). Renewables collectively provide 25. 3 % of the primary energy, in the form of hydro (14. 6 %), combustible renewable and waste (9 %), geothermal (1. 2 %), and the other renewables (0. 5 %). Although Turkey has a great geothermal potential (Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in geothermal energy potential), it uses only about 4 % of this potential efficiently. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy is clean and much cheaper compared to the other fossil fuels and other renewable energy sources for Turkey. Therefore, it is a promising alternative and development studies and investments in this sector should be supported. <b>Geothermal</b> energy <b>Electricity</b> Direct use Renewables Energy prices...|$|R
