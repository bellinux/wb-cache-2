40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the reduction in appetite and slowing of gastric emptying in older persons are poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of aging on small intestinal regulation of appetite, GI hormone release, and gastric myoelectrical activity. METHODS: Thirteen older (65 - 84 yr) and 13 young (18 - 32 yr) healthy men received isovolumetric, intraduodenal (i. d.) infusions of saline (control), lipid, and glucose for 120 min, on separate days. The energy content of the lipid and glucose infusions was identical at 2. 86 kcal/min. Immediately after the i. d. infusions, each subject was offered a buffet meal, and ad libitum food intake was quantified. Blood glucose and plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide were measured. Gastric myoelectrical activity was measured by surface electrogastrography (EGG). RESULTS: I. d. lipid suppressed food intake in both the young and older men (p < 0. 05), whereas i. <b>d.</b> <b>glucose</b> suppressed food intake only in the older men (p < 0. 05). The blood glucose (p < 0. 01) and insulin (p < 0. 05) responses to i. <b>d.</b> <b>glucose</b> were greater in older than young men. However, there were no differences in glucagon-like peptide 1 or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide responses to any of the infusions. There was a greater increase in the EGG power ratio both during and after i. <b>d.</b> <b>glucose</b> infusion in the young (p < 0. 05) than the older men, and an attenuation of EGG frequency by nutrient infusions in older, but not young, men. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that aging is associated with nutrient-specific changes in appetite, hormonal, and gastric myoelectrical (EGG) responses to i. d. nutrients. An enhanced satiating effect of small intestinal carbohydrates may potentially contribute to the anorexia of agin...|$|E

Shrimp were maintained for 12 d under laboratory conditions. Parasitized and unparasitized shrimp were starved for 15 <b>d,</b> and <b>glucose,</b> glycogen and total lipid concentrations were determined at 0, 24, 72, 168 and 360 h of starvation.

Parasitized shrimp had lower lipid concentrations than unparasitized shrimp, and preferentially metabolized carbohydrates. Bopyrids displayed a similar response, with glycogen depleted {{at the beginning of the}} starvation period followed by subsequent reestablishment. Our results demonstrated that bopyrids affect host energy allocation. The lower initial lipid concentration of parasitized shrimp suggested that the host is disadvantaged from both food deprivation and isopod nutritional demands.

The goal {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of flow velocity and nutrients on biofilm structure. Biofilms were grown in square glass capillary flow cells under laminar and turbulent flows. Biofilms were observed microscopically under flow conditions using image analysis. Mixed species bacterial biofilms were grown with glucose (40 mg/l) as the limiting nutrient. Biofilms grown under laminar conditions were patchy and consisted of roughly circular cell clusters separated by interstitial voids. Biofilms in the turbulent flow cell were also patchy but these biofilms consisted of patches of ripples and elongated 'streamers' which oscillated in the flow. To assess the influence of changing nutrient conditions on biofilm structure the glucose concentration was increased from 40 to 400 mg/l on an established 21 day old biofilm growing in turbulent flow. The cell clusters grew rapidly and the thickness of the biofilm increased from 30 µm to 130 µm within 17 h. The ripples disappeared after 10 hours.

40|$|Inhibition of {{pancreatic}} glucagon secretion during hyperglycemia {{could be}} mediated by (a) glucose, (b) insulin, (c) somatostatin, or (<b>d)</b> <b>glucose</b> {{in conjunction with}} insulin. To determine the role of these factors in the mediation of glucagon suppression, we injected alloxan while clamping the arterial supply of the pancreatic splenic lobe of dogs, thus inducing insulin deficiency localized to the ventral lobe and avoiding hyperglycemia. Ventral lobe insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin outputs were then measured {{in response to a}} stepped IV glucose infusion. In control dogs glucagon suppression occurred at a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and somatostatin output increased at glucose greater than 250 mg/dl. In alloxan-treated dogs glucagon output was not suppressed nor did somatostatin output increase. We concluded that insulin was required in the mediation of glucagon suppression and somatostatin stimulation. Subsequently, we infused insulin at high rates directly into the artery that supplied the beta cell-deficient lobe in six alloxan-treated dogs. Insulin infusion alone did not cause suppression of glucagon or stimulation of somatostatin; however, insulin repletion during glucose infusions did restore the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress glucagon and stimulate somatostatin. We conclude that intra-islet insulin permits glucose to suppress glucagon secretion and stimulate somatostatin during hyperglycemia...|$|E

Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX 6) is a key regulator of cellular redox balance, with the peculiar ability to neutralize peroxides, peroxynitrite, and phospholipid hydroperoxides. In the current study we aimed to define the role of PRDX 6 in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) using PRDX 6 knock-out (-/-) mice. Glucose and insulin responses were evaluated respectively by intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was analyzed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and molecular tools were used to investigate insulin signaling. Moreover, inflammatory and lipid parameters were evaluated. We demonstrated that PRDX 6 (-/-) mice developed a phenotype similar to early-stage T 2 D caused by both reduced glucose-dependent insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance. Impaired insulin signaling was present in PRDX 6 (-/-) mice, leading to reduction of muscle glucose uptake. Morphological and ultrastructural changes were observed in islets of Langerhans and livers of mutant animals, as well as altered plasma lipid profiles and inflammatory parameters. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PRDX 6 is a key mediator of overt hyperglycemia in T 2 <b>D</b> <b>glucose</b> metabolism, opening new perspectives for targeted therapeutic strategies in diabetes care...|$|E

Recent evidence has suggested that miR- 30 d may be acted as a novel antioncogene (Li et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2012).

The release of insulin recorded {{in the absence of}} D-glucose or at a non-stimulatory concentration (2. 5 mM) of the hexose is significantly enhanced when the islets are incubated {{in the presence of the}} meglitinide analogue A- 4166 (20 μM) or at a high concentration (30 mM) of extracellular K+. Nevertheless, even in the presence of A- 4166 or at the high K+ concentration, increasing concentrations of D-glucose, up to 20 mM, still enhance, in a sigmoidal manner, the secretion of insulin, with a 15 fold or greater increment in insulin output relative to the value found in the absence of the hexose. These findings indicate that D-glucose provides a concentration-related signal for insulin release, that cannot be attributed solely to either the closing of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, the depolarization of the plasma membrane, or the role of D-glucose as a nutrient to cover the energy expenditure in the islet cells.

Healthy normal-weight men were treated with olanzapine (10 mg/d; n = 7) or haloperidol (3 mg/d, n = 7) for 8 <b>d.</b> Endogenous <b>glucose</b> production, whole body glucose disposal (by [6, 6 -(2) H(2) ]glucose dilution), lipolysis (by [(2) H(5) ]glycerol dilution), and substrate oxidation rates (by indirect calorimetry) were measured before and after intervention in basal and hyperinsulinemic condition. Olanzapine hampered insulin-mediated glucose disposal (by 1. 3 mg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)), whereas haloperidol did not have a significant effect. Endogenous glucose production was not affected by either drug. Also, the glycerol rate of appearance (a measure of lipolysis rate) was not affected by either drug. Olanzapine, but not haloperidol, blunted the insulin-induced decline of plasma free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations. Fasting free fatty acid concentrations declined during olanzapine treatment, whereas they did not during treatment with haloperidol. Short-term treatment with olanzapine reduces fasting plasma free fatty acid concentrations and hampers insulin action on glucose disposal in healthy men, whereas haloperidol has less clear effects.

A kinetic analysis of the transfer of D galactose to N acetyl D glucosamine and to β(1 → 4) linked N acetylglucosamine oligomers, suggested that the active site region of the enzyme contains more than one binding site for acceptor molecules. Furthermore, experiments with N acetylglucosamine β(1 → 4) N acetylmuramic pentapeptide isolated from Micrococcus luteus indicated {{that the presence of}} a peptide chain does not enhance enzymic activity, as compared with the corresponding free disaccharide. Similar results were obtained using ovalbumin and the ovalbumin glycopeptide (which have similar apparent K(m) values for A protein) as galactose acceptors. In contrast to its ability to inhibit N acetyllactosamine production, α lactalbumin did not inhibit the transfer of D galactase to the N acetylglucosamine oligomers or the glycopeptides. Although α lactalbumin can switch the specificity of A protein from N acetyl D glucosamine to <b>D</b> <b>glucose</b> resulting in the production of lactose, no transfer of galactose was observed to β(1 → 4) linked glucose oligomers or to a collagen glycopeptide, D glucopyranosyl α(1 → 2) D galactopyranosyloxy β(1 → 5) lysine. It therefore appears that α lactalbumin can only modify human A protein for monosaccharide acceptors. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of oligofructose as a dietary fiber decreases the serum concentration and the hepatic release of VLDL-triglycerides in rats. Because glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and gut peptides [i. e., glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) ]) are factors {{involved in the}} metabolic response to nutrients, this paper analyzes their putative role in the hypolipidemic effect of oligofructose. Male Wistar rats were fed a nonpurified diet with or without 10 % oligofructose for 30 <b>d.</b> <b>Glucose,</b> insulin, IGF-I and GIP concentrations were measured in the serum of rats after eating. GIP and GLP- 1 contents were also assayed in small intestine and cecal extracts, respectively. A glucose tolerance test was performed in food-deprived rats. Serum insulin level was significantly lower in oligofructose-fed rats both after eating and in the glucose tolerance test, whereas glycemia was lower only in the postprandial state. IGF-I serum level did not differ between groups. GIP concentration was significantly higher in the serum of oligofructose-fed rats. The GLP- 1 cecal pool was also significantly higher. In this study, we have shown that cecal proliferation induced by oligofructose leads {{to an increase in}} GLP- 1 concentration. This latter incretin could be involved in the maintenance of glycemia despite a lower insulinemia in the glucose tolerance test in oligofructose-fed rats.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic {{activities of the}} aqueous preparation of Kalanchoe pinnata (K. pinnata) leaves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MethodsDiabetes mellitus was induced in rats by a single administration of streptozotocin (60 mg/Kg). Diabetic rats were then treated with aqueous K. pinnata for 30 <b>d.</b> Serum <b>glucose,</b> proteins, lipid composition, liver and kidney function indices, inflammatory markers, and key enzymes of hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were determined. ResultsThe untreated and treated diabetic groups lost weight and consumed less food compared to the normal group. We noted 37. 9 % decrease in fasting blood glucose in the treated diabetic group compared to 13. 2 % and 17. 0 % increases in normal and untreated diabetic groups respectively. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced in the treated diabetic group compared to the untreated diabetic group. Blood urea nitrogen was significantly (P< 0. 05) elevated in the untreated and treated diabetic groups compared to the normal group. Serum alkaline phosphatase and hepatic pyruvate kinase activities were significantly (P< 0. 05) elevated in the treated diabetic group. Serum albumin level was significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced in the untreated diabetic group. Serum IL- 6 was significantly (P< 0. 05) depressed in the treated diabetic group. ConclusionsThe observed decrease in body weight, blood glucose and cholesterol level suggests that the aqueous K. pinnata preparation consumption may be beneficial {{in the management of}} diabetes mellitus. The observed adverse effect on alkaline phosphatase activity {{may be due to the}} combined effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and K. pinnata preparation administration...|$|R

We hypothesized {{that the degree of}} insulin resistance would predict protein catabolism in non-diabetic CHD patients. We examined the relationship between Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and fasting whole-body and skeletal muscle protein turnover in 18 non-diabetic CHD patients using primed-constant infusions of L-(1 - 13 C) leucine and L-(ring- 2 H 5) phenylalanine. Mean±s. <b>d.</b> fasting <b>glucose</b> and body mass index were 80. 6 ± 9. 8 mg/dl and 25. 4 ± 4. 4 kg/m 2, respectively. Median (interquartile range) HOMA was 1. 6 (1. 4, 3. 9). Mean±s. e. m. skeletal muscle protein synthesis, breakdown, and net balance were 89. 57 ± 11. 67, 97. 02 ± 13. 3, and - 7. 44 ± 7. 14 μg/ 100 ml/min, respectively. Using linear regression, a positive correlation was observed between HOMA and skeletal muscle protein synthesis (R 2 = 0. 28; P= 0. 024), and breakdown (R 2 = 0. 49; P= 0. 001). An inverse association between net skeletal muscle protein balance and HOMA was also noted (R 2 = 0. 20; P= 0. 066). After adjustment for C-reactive protein, only the relationship between HOMA and skeletal muscle protein breakdown persisted (R 2 = 0. 49; P= 0. 006). There were no significant associations between components of whole-body protein turnover and HOMA. This study demonstrates that insulin resistance is evident in non-diabetic dialysis patients, is associated with skeletal muscle protein breakdown, and represents a novel target for intervention in uremic wasting...|$|R
40|$|Taurine is a conditionally {{essential}} amino acid for human that {{is involved in the}} control of glucose homeostasis; however, the mechanisms by which the amino acid affects blood glucose levels are unknown. Using an animal model, we have studied these mechanisms. Mice were supplemented with taurine for 30 <b>d.</b> Blood <b>glucose</b> homeostasis was assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Islet cell function was determined by insulin secretion, cytosolic Ca 2 + measurements and glucose metabolism from isolated islets. Islet cell gene expression and translocation was examined via immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Insulin signaling was studied by Western blot. Islets from taurine-supplemented mice had: (i) significantly higher insulin content, (ii) increased insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose concentrations, (iii) significantly displaced the dose-response curve for glucose-induced insulin release to the left, (iv) increased glucose metabolism at 5. 6 and 11. 1 -mmol/L concentrations; (v) slowed cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) oscillations in response to stimulatory glucose concentrations; (vi) increased insulin, sulfonylurea receptor- 1, glucokinase, Glut- 2, proconvertase and pancreas duodenum homeobox- 1 (PDX- 1) gene expression and (vii) increased PDX- 1 expression in the nucleus. Moreover, taurine supplementation significantly increased both basal and insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in skeletal muscle and liver tissues. Finally, taurine supplemented mice showed an improved IPGTT. These results indicate that taurine controls glucose homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, taurine enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Recent studies suggest that oxidative stress may {{play a major role}} in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the association of vitamin D with oxidative stress is still not known in PCOS. Objective: The goal of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and oxidative stress markers in PCOS group compared to control group. Materials and Methods: 60 PCOS women (20 - 40 yr old) and 90 healthy women as control group were participated in this case-control study. Fasting serum level of 25 -hydroxy vitamin D 25 (OH) <b>D,</b> <b>glucose,</b> insulin, calcium, malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), also homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FGIR) were measured. Results: It was found that the mean of serum 25 (OH) D was lower in the PCOS group (10. 76 ± 4. 17) than in the control group (12. 07 ± 6. 26) but this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 125). Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and MDA were significantly higher in the PCOS patients as compared to the controls, whereas PC level did not differ for the two groups (p= 0. 156). No significant correlations were found between 25 (OH) D levels and oxidative stress markers (MDA and PC).

Methods and results: We examined the effects of a daily intake of milk enriched with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) for 5 months, on several cardiovascular (CVD) risk biomarkers in healthy children aged 8 - 14 years. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a total of 107 children of both genders were assigned to two study groups: 1) a supplemented group (SG, n= 53) who consumed 0. 6. L/day of an enriched dairy product, and 2) a control group (CG, n= 54) who consumed 0. 6. L/day of standard whole milk. Both groups consumed the dairy drinks for 5 months, in addition to their usual diet. Serum levels of adhesion molecules as indices of vascular endothelial cell activation were assessed in both groups at 0 and 5 months as well as white blood cell counts, lipid profile, serum proteins, total serum calcium, 25 -OH vitamin <b>D,</b> <b>glucose,</b> insulin and adiponectin. In the enriched dairy drink supplemented group, adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM- 1 as well as lymphocyte levels decreased while plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and serum calcium concentrations increased. In the control group, serum total protein, transferrin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations decreased.

This study examined the effect of TUDCA on cardiomyocyte function in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Adult mice were fed low or high fat diet for 5 months prior to treatment of TUDCA (300 mg/kg. i. p., for 15 <b>d).</b> Intraperitoneal <b>glucose</b> tolerance test (IPGTT), cardiomyocyte mechanical and intracellular Ca(2 +) property, insulin signaling molecules including IRS- 1, Akt, AMPK, ACC, GSK- 3 β, c-Jun, ERK and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) as well as ER stress and intracellular Ca(2 +) regulatory proteins were examined. Myocardial ultrastructure was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High-fat diet depressed peak shortening (PS) and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthenin as well as prolonged relengthening duration. TUDCA reversed or overtly ameliorated high fat diet-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction including prolongation in relengthening. TUDCA alleviated high-fat diet-induced decrease in SERCA 2 a and phosphorylation of phospholamban, increase in ER stress (GRP 78 /BiP, CHOP, phosphorylation of PERK, IRE 1 α and eIF 2 α), ultrastructural changes and mitochondrial permeation pore opening. High-fat diet feeding inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK and promoted phosphorylation of GSK- 3 β. TUDCA prevented high fat-induced dephosphorylation of AMPK but not GSK- 3 β. High fat diet promoted phosphorylation of IRS- 1 (Ser(307)), JNK, and ERK without affecting c-Jun phosphorylation, the effect of which with the exception of ERK phosphorylation was attenuated by TUDCA. These data depict that TUDCA may ameliorate high fat diet feeding-induced cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca(2 +) defects through mechanisms associated with mitochondrial integrity, AMPK, JNK and IRS- 1 serine phosphorylation...|$|R

40|$|MALDI-TOF MS is used {{successfully}} in investigating in vitro glycation of normal and variant hemoglobins (Hbs). Singly glycated, doubly glycated, and/or multiply glycated glycoisoforms of the alpha-globin, beta-globin, and gamma-globin of Hbs are observed. Different glycation rates are observed for normal and variant Hbs, with the normal Hb A having the slowest rate. The normal Hb A is {{more stable than}} the Hb C, Hb E, Hb F, Hb Leiden, and Hb San Diego upon condensation with glucose at 37 °C. Data reveal that with longer incubation time (up to 5 <b>d),</b> higher <b>glucose</b> concentration (up to 1 M), and higher temperature (up to 37 °C), the number of glycated amino acid residues of Hbs increase. The extent of the glycation of both Hb A and Hb F increases upon changing the solvent from PBS (pH 7. 4) to carbonate buffer (pH 10). However, this pH change has a lesser effect on the glycation of the Hb C, Hb E, or Hb Leiden. In this study, higher concentration of the glucose is used to increase the reaction rate of the less reactive residues, and higher pH is used to alter the structures of proteins and consequently expose the reactive amino acid residues. However, incubation time is kept relatively short. Results obtained in this study {{could lead to the}} inference that effects of the incubation time, glucose concentration, temperature, and pH on the linkage of Hbs with glucose would be similar under the diabetes conditions in vivo (~ 37 °C, ~neutral pH, ~ 0. 007 M glucose concentration).
