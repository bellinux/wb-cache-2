40|$|Postinflammatory {{hyperpigmentation}} is {{a common}} sequelae of inflammatory dermatoses that tends to affect darker skinned patients with greater frequency and severity. Epidemiological studies show that <b>dyschromias,</b> including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, {{are among the most}} common reasons darker racial/ethnic groups seek the care of a dermatologist. The treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation should be started early to help hasten its resolution and begins with management of the initial inflammatory condition. First-line therapy typically consists of topical depigmenting agents in addition to photoprotection including a sunscreen. Topical tyrosinase inhibitors, such as hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, arbutin, and certain licorice extracts, can effectively lighten areas of hypermelanosis. Other depigmenting agents include retinoids, mequinol, ascorbic acid, niacinamide, N-acetyl glucosamine, and soy with a number of emerging therapies on the horizon. Topical therapy is typically effective for epidermal postinflammatory hyperpigmentation; however, certain procedures, such as chemical peeling and laser therapy, may help treat recalcitrant hyperpigmentation. It is also important to use caution with all of the above treatments to prevent irritation and worsening of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation...|$|R

Understanding the differences in the basic science of skin and hair is imperative in addressing their unique needs. Despite the paucity of conclusive data on racial and ethnic differences in skin of color, certain biologic differences do exist, which affect the disease presentations of several cutaneous disorders in pigmented skin. While the overall pathogenesis and treatments for acne in women of color are similar to Caucasian men and women, individuals with darker skin types present more frequently with <b>dyschromias</b> from acne, which can be difficult to manage. Melasma is an acquired pigmentary disorder seen commonly in women with darker skin types and is strongly associated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, genetic factors, and hormonal influences.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Case {{study of}} a CNS {{impairment}} lacking in presumptive cause; case presents with a clinical phenotype encompassing multiple differently expressed and combined symptoms, {{as well as a}} subtle skin defect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 6 -year-old male with apparently isolated mental delay, speech delay, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, and subtle and insignificant skin <b>dyschromias.</b> The patient underwent a systematic evaluation, including clinical history; medical, neurological and ophthalmologic examinations. Skin, teeth, nails, hair and sudation were examined for defects. Routine laboratory tests for blood, urine, were performed. The proband had thyroid function tests, electrocardiography, genitourinary system and abdominal examinations. Special examinations pertaining to mental performance, biochemistry, chromosome studies, imaging and electrodiagnostic studies, and skin biopsy were also performed. RESULTS: Investigators ruled out genetic syndromes, congenital infections, fetal deprivation, perinatal insults, intrauterine exposure to drug abuse, and postnatal events such as CNS infections as possible common causes of brain impairment. Being all further test negative, the patient exhibited an ultrastructural defect of the skin, identical to that previously described [Buoni S, Zannolli R, de Santi MM, Macucci F, Hayek J, Orsi A et al. Neurocutaneous syndrome with mental delay, autism, blockage in intracellular vesicular trafficking and melanosome defects.

CONCLUSIONS: This new devasting, ultrastructural phenotype accompanied by apparently unspecific and mixed neurological symptoms should represent a future challenge to finally discover the pathogenesis of many childhood CNS symptoms, that currently seem to lack any apparent caus...|$|R
40|$|Lymphangioma, a rare benign {{malformation}} of lymphatic channels, {{is among}} the surgically treatable diseases of the lymphatic vessels. However, damage to surrounding structures together with incomplete resection due to adjacent organ infiltration and a high recurrence rate have encouraged the search for alternative treatments. This study aimed to identify the best therapeutic management for this difficult-to-treat disease. This report describes a case of congenital lymphangioma in the gluteal region in a young woman. First, sclerotherapy of the lymphangioma was performed and then surgical excision of residual lesions. Finally, as a third therapeutic step, the patient also was subjected to a cycle of laser therapy {{with the aim of}} further improving the appearance of the gluteal region. Pulsed dye laser was used to remove cutaneous <b>dyschromias,</b> and an erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser was used to remove surface irregularities and obtain better skin smoothness. The outcome assessments included standardized photography, the physician's global assessment, the patient's satisfaction scores, and magnetic resonance imaging of the gluteal region. All the lesions of lymphangioma were removed. After the last laser treatment, the skin of the entire treated region was eutrophic and uniform in color, and it appeared to be smooth and soft when palpated. The patient was satisfied with the clinical and aesthetic results achieved. The combination of sclerotherapy with surgery can be a good solution for the treatment of lymphangioma. The authors also propose laser therapy as an additional therapeutic approach that may follow surgery or sclerotherapy with the aim of improving the skin trophism and the appearance of the affected region.

40|$|Introduction: Fractional laser {{technology}} is a new emerging technology to improve scars, fine lines, dyspigmentation, striae and wrinkles. The technique is easy, safe to use and has been used effectively for several clinical and cosmetic indications in Indian skin. Devices: Different fractional laser machines, with different wavelengths, both ablative and non-ablative, are now available in India. A detailed understanding of the device being used is recommended. Indications: Common indications include resurfacing for acne, chickenpox and surgical scars, periorbital and perioral wrinkles, photoageing changes, facial <b>dyschromias.</b> The use of fractional lasers in stretch marks, melasma and other pigmentary conditions, dermatological conditions such as granuloma annulare has been reported. But further data are needed before adopting them for routine use in such conditions. Physician qualification: Any qualified dermatologist may administer fractional laser treatment. He/ she should possess a Master&#x 2032;s degree or diploma in dermatology and should have had specific hands-on training in lasers, either during postgraduation or later at a facility which routinely performs laser procedures under a competent dermatologist or plastic surgeon with experience and training in using lasers. Since parameters may vary with different systems, specific training tailored towards the concerned device at either the manufacturer&#x 2032;s facility or at another center using the machine is recommended. Facility: Fractional lasers {{can be used in}} the dermatologist&#x 2032;s minor procedure room for the above indications. Preoperative counseling and Informed consent: Detailed counseling with respect to the treatment, desired effects and possible postoperative complications should be provided to the patient. The patient should be provided brochures to study and also adequate opportunity to seek information. A detailed consent form needs to be completed by the patient. Consent form should include information on the machine, possible postoperative course expected and postoperative complications. Preoperative photography should be carried out in all cases of resurfacing. A close-up front and 45 -degree lateral photographs of both sides must be taken. Laser parameters: There are different machines based on different technologies available. Choice parameters depend on the type of machine, location and type of lesion, and skin color. Physician needs to be familiar with these requirements before using the machine. Anesthesia: Fractional laser treatment can be carried out under topical anesthesia with eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. Some machines can be used without any anesthesia or only with topical cooling or cryospray. But for maximal patient comfort, a topical anesthetic prior to the procedure is recommended. Postoperative care: Proper postoperative care is important in avoiding complications. Post-treatment edema and redness settle in a few hours to a few days. A sunscreen is mandatory, and emollients may be prescribed for the dryness and peeling that could occur...|$|R

Hemo chromatosis gene mutations were investigated. The levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and blood cell counts were analyzed. The presence of hemosiderin was investigated through periulcerous and ulcer fundus biopsies carried out at baseline and 30 days after treatment with Lactoferrin. The severity of the injuries (CEAP classification) was evaluated at the beginning of and throughout the whole 3 -month treatment period. No patient had received compression treatment during the three months previous to this therapy. Significant improvement in these injuries, with a reduction in the dimensions of the brown spot (9 of 9) at Day 90, and complete scarring with a closure time ranging from 15 to 180 days (7 of 9) were observed.

While the vascular alterations of poikiloderma of Civatte can be effectively treated with lasers or intense pulsed light, a successful treatment of <b>dyschromia,</b> skin laxity and wrinkles is still difficult to achieve. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-ablative fractional 1540 erbium glass laser {{for the treatment of}} aged neck skin, also by means of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). Methods: A prospective study for neck resurfacing in 18 women with aged neck skin. Six laser treatments were performed in 4 -week intervals with a 1540 -nm erbium-glass fiber laser. Results: By using a 6 -point grading scale, the mean score (±SD; range) at baseline was 3. 6 (± 1. 5; 1 - 6) for skin <b>dyschromia,</b> 2. 9 (± 1. 4; 1 - 6) for laxity and 3. 3 (± 1. 3; 1 - 5) for wrinkles. Three months after the last laser session, we found a significant clinical improvement of <b>dyschromia</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 0002; Wilcoxon test), and wrinkles (p[*]=[*] 0. 0004; Wilcoxon test), with a mean (±SD) reduction of 2. 5 (± 1. 0) and 1. 9 (± 1. 1) points in the 6 -point grading scale, respectively. No change was observed in laxity. These results were also supported by structural changes documented by RCM. Conclusion: Non-ablative fractional 1540 erbium glass laser was both safe and effective for the treatment of <b>dyschromia</b> and wrinkles, but not effective for the laxity {{of the neck}} skin...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background: Hydroxychloroquine {{may result in}} cutaneous <b>dyschromia.</b> Older individuals who {{are the victims of}} elder abuse can present with bruising and resolving ecchymoses. Purpose: The features of hydroxychloroquine-associated hyperpigmentation are described, the mucosal and skin manifestations of elder abuse are reviewed, and the mucocutaneous mimickers of elder abuse are summarized. Case Report: An elderly woman being treated with hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus developed drug-associated black and blue pigmentation of her skin. The <b>dyschromia</b> was misinterpreted by her clinician as elder abuse and Adult Protective Services was notified. The family was eventually cleared of suspected elder abuse. A skin biopsy of the patient’s <b>dyschromia</b> confirmed the diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine-associated hyperpigmentation. Conclusion: Hyperpigmentation of skin, mucosa, and nails can be observed in patients treated with antimalarials, including hydroxychloroquine. Elder abuse is a significant and underreported problem in seniors. Cutaneous findings can aid in the discovery of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and self-neglect in elderly individuals. However, medication-associated effects, systemic conditions, and accidental external injuries can mimic elder abuse. Therefore, a complete medical history and appropriate laboratory evaluation, including skin biopsy, should be conducted when the diagnosis of elder abuse is suspected...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantification}} of the discriminative {{power of}} the visual features of a skin lesion {{by means of an}} information theoretical approach Introduction: In dermatology, the ability to recognize and interpret skin lesions is of fundamental importance for the diagnostic process. In this process, there is a considerable role for the visual features of a skin lesion. An interesting question regarding the diagnostic pro-cess is related to the discriminiative power of each of these features; how heavily should the decision concerning a diagnosis be influenced by the red colour or the round shape of a skin lesion? The answer could be of added value for the diagnostics of skin lesions. Objective: To quantify the discriminative {{power of the}} visual features of a skin lesion by means of an information theoretical approach. Material and Method: A dataset is made up from 400 manually selected images of 10 very common skin diseases (40 images per skin disease). The images, derived from the digital image archive of the department of Dermatology of the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG), are diagnose verified. The aspects Part of the body, Spatial arrangement, Size (number and size), Shape (two- and threedimensional), Boundary sharpness, Colour, Morpho-logical group and Surface are used to annotate the skin lesions on the images, each aspect excisting out of more features. Per aspect, only one feature is assigned to a skin lesion. The probabilities of occurence of 81 features in total among the 10 skin diseases are determind. The entropy of these probability distributions is calculated and used in order to define a meas-ure which expresses the discriminative power of each feature. The discriminative power takes its values between 0 and 1. The power equals 0 if a certain feature is equally likely (not) to be observed among the different skin diseases. The power equals 1 if a certain feature does (not) occur 40 times for one single skin disease only. Results: The discriminative power of the features varies between 0 and 0. 275. A circi-nar spatial arrangement, the presence of more than 10 lesions, the 3 D-shape raised edge, the colour red, the morphological groups ulcerous dermatoses, erythema(papulo) squamous der-matoses and the <b>dyschromias</b> and the surfaces verrucous and papillomatous belong to the most discriminative features. The features are ranked on their discriminative power and used in a naive Bayesian classifier. The perfomance of the classifier confirms the soundness of the used method. Conclusion: The defined measure seems to be a reliable way of expressing the dis-criminative power of the visual features of a skin lesion. It could be of added value for the diagnostic process in daily practice {{as well as for the}} development of computer-aided diagno-sis systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The novel {{concept of}} non-ablative {{fractional}} photothermolysis {{was introduced to}} the market in 2003 as an answer to the need for effective, yet low risk, resurfacing techniques. Unlike conventional ablative and non-ablative lasers, fractional ablative and non-ablative photothermolysis treats {{only a fraction of the}} skin, leaving up to a maximum of 95 % of the skin uninvolved. The undamaged surrounding tissue allows for a reservoir of viable tissue, permitting rapid epidermal repair. Non-ablative fractional photothermolysis is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pigmented lesions, periorbital rhytides, skin resurfacing, melasma and soft tissue coagulation, acne and surgical scars, and actinic keratoses. However, its off-label use is clearly more extended.

The authors treated 15 patients (11 female and 4 male) for perioral rhytides with Voltaic arc dermoabrasion technique. Patient ages ranged between 30 and 65 years and the majority (90 %) of these perioral areas had class II and III wrinkle scores. Voltaic arc dermoabrasion (PLEXR, GMV s. r. l. Grottaferrata, Italy) were used to remove the keratinized layer for point perioral area. Treatment is minimally painful and in the authors’ experience require no anesthesia. No discomfort should be expected once the voltaic arc dermoabrasion treatment is concluded. The perioral dermis appears as a pale, erythematous, dull surface. Bleeding is not seen unless excessive abrading occurs with the saline-moistened gauze. No hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, erythema, ecchymosis, pain, itching, outbreaks of herpes, infectious processes and scarring was observed. In conclusion fine rhytides, particularly in the perioral areas may be completely eradicated with voltaic arc resurfacing; deeper creases are also improved, probably secondary to a general tightening effect...|$|E
40|$|Fractional lasers {{were first}} {{developed}} based on observations of lasers designed for hair transplantation. In 2007, ablative fractional laser resurfacing was introduced. The fractionation allowed deeper tissue penetration, leading to greater tissue contraction, collagen production and tissue remodeling. Since then, fractional erbium:YAG resurfacing lasers {{have also been}} introduced. These lasers have yielded excellent results in treating photoaging, acne scarring, and <b>dyschromia.</b> With the adjustment of microspot density, pulse duration, number of passes, and fluence, the surgeon can adjust the treatment effects. These lasers have allowed surgeons to treat patients with higher Fitzpatrick skin types (types IV to VI) and greater individualize treatments to various facial subunits. Immunohistochemical analysis has demonstrated remodeling effects of the tissues for several months, producing longer lasting results. Adjuvant treatments are also under investigation, including concomitant face-lift, product deposition, and platelet-rich plasma. Finally, there is a short recovery time from treatment with these lasers, allowing patients to resume regular activities more quickly. Although there is a relatively high safety profile for ablative fractionated lasers, surgeons {{should be aware of}} the limitations of specific treatments and the associated risks and complications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Autologous plasma-rich {{platelet}} (PRP) {{is a human}} platelet concentrated product {{which is}} in low volume of plasma. Using PRP in rejuvenation and resolution of some cosmetic problems has been already popular in many countries and also in Iran. As no study performed in this field in Iran and regarding the high prevalence of using PRP in society with no validate references {{in the case of}} skin rejuvenation, we are trying to research clinical effects of PRP facial rejuvenation.   Materials and Methods:  In this clinical trial, 30 volunteer persons with Glogau score of II and III were participated. Appropriate amount of blood obtained in two sessions with 3 months interval and used in order to produce plasma-rich platelet. Immediately after production of platelets, platelet concentrated product injected in sterile condition and 4 ˚C by an expert physician. Injections were 1 cc in upper zone of face, 1 cc in cheeks and 1 cc in lower zone of face and were sub-dermal and intra-dermal (Threading technique). Injections were done in two sessions with 3 months interval. Before the beginning and after the end of treatment, digital photography of patients provided. Evaluation of wrinkle improvement was done on the basis of personal judgment of patient and observation of before and after treatment photography by therapeutic physician and a dermatologist who is unaware of order of photos. Results: Mean age of patients was 45. 1 ± 6. 89 years and in the range of 35 to 55 years. In 3 and 6 months follow-ups, most of patients reported moderate to excellent improvement in periorbital darkness, periorbital wrinkle, nasolabial fold and skin rigidity. Also, in general evaluation of patients in 3 and 6 months follow-ups, most of the patients reported moderate to excellent improvement and only 17 % of patients reported no improvement or mild improvement. In therapeutic physician assessment, in 3 and 6 months follow-ups, mild to moderate improvement in periorbital wrinkle and <b>dyschromia</b> in most of the patients reported. But in nasolabial fold assessment, no improvement reported in most of them. In second physician assessment, no improvement or mild improvement was observed in periorbital wrinkle in 3 and 6 months follow-ups. For <b>dyschromia,</b> mild to moderate improvement and for nasolabial fold, no improvement were reported in most of the patients. Conclusion:  In this study, patients’ improvement in the assessments of the patients, therapeutic physician and second physician (unaware of study) observed variably which was the most in patients’ satisfaction evaluation. Additionally, best effects of PRP in rejuvenation were specified to improvement of periorbital darkness and decreasing skin wrinkle. Keywords: Facial skin rejuvenation, Plasma-rich platelet. ...|$|E
40|$|In Italy the {{economic}} crisis has caused changes in behavior in daily as well as leisure activities. For instance, night clubs have changed both their scenography {{and what they can}} offer. From simply providing a place to dance, they can now offer more complex scenography with spectacular fireworks and lit cocktails. While this can be amazing for all of us it can also be another cause of burn injuries. We conducted a retrospective study of all burns patients admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department at CTO Hospital in Turin from 2009 to 2013, after a night clubbing. A total of five patients were identified with an average age of 20 years old: four were burned by flaming cocktails and one was burned by a firework. Two received outpatient treatment, while orotracheal intubation and admission were needed for three, and two required surgical debridement and resurfacing with split skin graft. All patients had permanent sequelae caused by pathologic scarring and/or <b>dyschromia.</b> Our findings show that the risk of burn injuries is higher at weekends, mainly in summer, if all correct safety procedures are not followed. Meanwhile it is important to highlight that the promotion of inappropriate behavior at night clubs during firework displays and the passing of flaming cocktails should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} {{increased}} sun exposure, oral contraceptives, and phototoxic drugs {{has led to}} an in-creased prevalence of conditions such as <b>dyschromia,</b> melasma, rhytides, and other signs of photoaging over the past few decades. Through the application of selective photothermolysis, laser surgery has attempted to create therapeutic options for these medically recalcitrant conditions. To date, however, this technology has been met with limited success, due to a high incidence of posttreatment side effects, inability to treat off the face, and a safety profile tailored to Fitzpatrick skin types I to III. More recently, a novel approach coined ‘‘fractional photothermolysis’ ’ was developed in an attempt to overcome these limitations. This new laser treatment modality has allowed for effective treatment of a diverse array of dermatologic conditions on and off the face with a wider therapeutic index and improved safety profile independent of Fitzpatrick skin type. This review sheds light on the technical aspects, biologic mech-anisms, and clinical effects of fractional photothermolysis that help set it apart from previous modes of laser surgery. Basil M. Hantash, MD, PhD, has applied for patents in the use of fractional photothermolysis. Until recently, selective photothermolysis (SP) represented the most efficacious mode of sur-gical laser treatment for conditions such as melasma...|$|E
