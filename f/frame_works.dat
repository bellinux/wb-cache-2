6000|$|At 2 P.M. {{the caravan}} started along the Fiumara course {{in rear of}} the deserted kraal, and after an hour's ascent Rirash {{informed}} us that a well was near. The Hammal and I, taking two water skins, urged our mules over stones and thorny ground: presently we arrived at a rocky ravine, where, surrounded by brambles, rude walls, and tough <b>frame</b> <b>works,</b> lay the wells-- three or four holes sunk ten feet deep in the limestone. Whilst we bathed in the sulphureous spring, which at once discolored my silver ring, Rirash, baling up the water in his shield, filled the bags and bound them to the saddles. In haste we rejoined the caravan, which we found about sunset, halted by the vain fears of the guides. The ridge upon which they stood was a mass of old mosques and groves, showing that in former days a thick population tenanted these hills: from the summit appeared distant herds of kine and white flocks scattered like patches of mountain quartz. Riding in advance, we traversed the stony ridge, fell into another ravine, and soon saw signs of human life. A shepherd descried us from afar and ran away reckless of property; causing the End of Time to roll his head with dignity, and to ejaculate, [...] "Of a truth said the Prophet of Allah, 'fear is divided.'" [...] Presently we fell in with a village, from which the people rushed out, some exclaiming, [...] "Lo! {{let us look at}} the kings!" [...] others, [...] "Come, see the white man, he is governor of Zayla!" [...] I objected to such dignity, principally on account of its price: my companions, however, were inexorable; they would be Salatin--kings--and my colour was against claims to low degree. This fairness, and the Arab dress, made me at different times the ruler of Aden, the chief of Zayla, the Hajj's son, a boy, an old woman, a man painted white, a warrior in silver armour, a merchant, a pilgrim, a hedgepriest, Ahmed the Indian, a Turk, an Egyptian, a Frenchman, a Banyan, a sherif, and lastly a Calamity sent down from heaven to weary out the lives of the Somal: every kraal had some conjecture of its own, and each fresh theory was received by my companions with roars of laughter.|$|E

50|$|Art {{scientists}} have linked Horst Gläsker with the category “Individual Mythology” coined by Harald Szeemann or grouped {{him with the}} “Junge Wilde” ("wild youth"). The closest definition of his art is perhaps {{the idea of the}} “Gesamtkunstwerk”. Harald Falckenberg (see: Collection Falckenberg), the Hamburger art collector, businessman, lawyer and art theorist, described him as ”bird of paradise and holy fool” and saw him in a reference to the newer development of the “pictorial turn” and the ancient tradition of the grotesque. Besides the relation of his art to music, there is the connection with architecture. This began in the 80s with space filling painting on wallpapers, self built and repainted architectural pieces, and space <b>frame</b> <b>works</b> like columns, candelabra, cupolas, and pavilions etc. Following on from that there were numerous “art in architecture” applications and projects, for example murals, mosaics, fountains and floor designs. The art theorist and curator Manfred Schneckenburger named Gläsker, in relation to his carpet and wallpaper paintings, the European founder of the Pattern Art and wrote that he developed his own particular new, idea of the ornament, “as if the hard verdict of Adolf Loos “ornament is a crime” had never existed".|$|E

50|$|By 1860, {{the volume}} of ore shipped through the Soo Locks had {{increased}} to 114,401 tons, only to fall again to 49,909 tons in 1861 after the American Civil War broke out. However, by 1862, an additional wooden dock had been constructed at Marquette, this time featuring an elevated railway trestle for ore jennies to discharge ore into pockets. In 1911 another iron ore loading dock was built, where the wooden frame work was replaced with a concrete and steel frame work. The new iron ore loading dock at Marquette, was 1200 feet long; 75 feet high; and 60 feet wide. Four railroad tracks ran across the top and there was storage space inside the bottom concrete part for 60,000 tons of iron ore. The new iron ore loading dock incorporated a concrete bottom half with and a light steel frame work on top; doing away with the wooden supports used in previous iron ore docks. While more expensive than previous iron ore loading docks, that used both iron and wood <b>frame</b> <b>works,</b> the builders claimed the new construction would hold up far longer than the old construction method. Schooners now started to feature regularly spaced hatch covers, speeding up loading. However steamers of the day were not well adapted for bulk cargoes such as iron ore. They did not have hatches through their decks. Instead they had gangways through the sides. So ore shipments were loaded via wheelbarrows through the gangways. The docks had provisions for this by having a flat surface {{on one side and}} moorings directly under the pockets for schooners to receive the ore directly, while steamers moored {{on the opposite side of}} the dock. However, unloading was still a laborious hand-powered affair.|$|E
