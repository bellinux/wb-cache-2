As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E

The server lifetimes {{are assumed to}} be geometrical and the server repair times are arbitrarily distributed. We study the Markov chain underlying the considered queueing system and present its stability condition as well as some performance measures of the system in steady-state. Then, we derive a stochastic decomposition law and as an application we give bounds for the proximity between the steady-state distributions of our system and the corresponding system without retrials. Also, we introduce the concept of generalized service time and develop a recursive procedure to obtain the steady-state distributions of the orbit and system size. Finally, we prove the convergence to the continuous-time counterpart and show some numerical results.
