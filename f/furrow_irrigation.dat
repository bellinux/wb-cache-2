25|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{irrigation}} {{that can be}} used in viticulture depending on the amount of control and water management desired. Historically, surface irrigation was the most common means using the gravity of a slope to release a flood of water across the vineyard. In the early history of the Chilean wine industry, flood irrigation was widely practiced in the vineyards using melted snow from the Andes Mountains channeled down to the valleys below. This method provided very little control and often had the adverse effect of over-watering the vine. An adaption of method was the <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> system used in Argentina where small channels ran through the vineyard providing irrigation. This provide slightly more control since the initial amount of water entering the channels could be regulated, however the amount that each vine received was sporadic.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{many areas}} of the central U. S. Great Plains {{irrigation}} well capacities are decreasing due to declines in the Ogallala aquifer. Many producers using <b>furrow</b> surface <b>irrigation</b> are faced with a decision on whether they should convert to a higher efficiency center pivot sprinkler irrigation system. An irrigation scheduling model using 27 years of climatic data for western Kansas was combined with a corn yield production function and economic model to simulate crop yields and economics under four combinations of irrigation system and application efficiency for six different irrigation capacities. Center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems were found to give higher corn yields and greater profitability than <b>furrow</b> surface <b>irrigation,</b> particularly when system flow rates were less than 40 L/s. Sprinkler irrigation systems with application efficiencies of 100, 95, and 85 % and a <b>furrow</b> surface <b>irrigation</b> system with 70 % application efficiency produced simulated crop yields of 12. 3, 12. 2, 12. 1, and 11. 3 Mg/ha, respectively, when irrigation capacity was 6. 35 mm/day. Reducing the irrigation capacity to 2. 54 mm/day reduced yields to 9. 4, 9. 2, 8. 9, and 8. 3 Mg/ha for the respective irrigation systems. Net annual returns for a 65 ha field were increased by US$ 1000 to $ 4000 with center pivot sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> compared to <b>furrow</b> surface <b>irrigation</b> for system flow rates between approximately 20 and 40 L/s. Labor savings with sprinkler irrigation are a significant factor in profitability, but increased crop yields are also very important, particularly at lower system flow rates of approximately 20 – 30 L/s...|$|R

25|$|Historically, flood {{irrigation}} {{was the most}} common method used, whereby large amounts of water are allowed to run across flat vineyard lands. While this method may have been an unwittingly preventive measure against the advance of phylloxera, it does not provide much control for the vineyard manager to limit yields and increase potential quality in the wine grapes. Subsequently, a method of <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> was developed whereby water is funneled into furrow channels that the vines are planted in. While providing a little more control, this method was still more suited to producing high yields. In the late 1990s, drip irrigation started to become more popular. Though expensive to install, this method provides for the maximum level of control by the vineyard manager to facilitate yield control and increase potential quality in the grape by leveraging water stress on the vine.|$|E
25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E

50|$|<b>Furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> is {{conducted}} by creating small parallel channels along the field length {{in the direction}} of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the inflow rate and soil infiltration rate. The spacing between adjacent furrows is governed by the crop species, common spacings typically range from 0.75 to 2 metres. The crop is planted on the ridge between furrows which may contain a single row of plants or several rows {{in the case of a}} bed type system. Furrows may range anywhere from less than 100 m to 2000 m long depending on the soil type, location and crop type. Shorter furrows are commonly associated with higher uniformity of application but result in increasing potential for runoff losses. <b>Furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> is particularly suited to broad-acre row crops such as cotton, maize and sugar cane.

Water leaving from 4 separate irrigation bays, which consisted of 25 <b>furrows</b> per <b>irrigation</b> bay (Expt 1) or 39 <b>furrows</b> per <b>irrigation</b> bay (Expt 2), was monitored over time. The average concentration of endosulfan α and β and bupirimate leaving the irrigation bays {{for the duration of the}} single irrigation event was generally always less for the PAM-treated irrigation bays than the control (control treatment). The addition of PAM to the irrigation water significantly decreased the cumulative runoff losses (g) of total endosulfan by 54 % from 11. 41 to 5. 19 g/ha (P< 0. 05), and of chlorothalonil by 49 % from 53. 65 to 27. 32 g/ha (P< 0. 001). There was no statistical difference in the load of atrazine or bupirimate leaving either treatment. Although the additionofPAMto irrigationwater effectively decreased the off-sitemovement of 2 fairly strongly sorbed pesticides, endosulfan and chlorothalonil, it did not decrease the total load moving off-site of the more weakly sorbed pesticides, bupirimate and atrazine. The addition of PAM as a liquid to irrigation water was not found to increase the infiltration of a soluble pesticide, atrazine, into the soil profile.
