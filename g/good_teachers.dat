Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

The theoretical basis for this essay is the definition of an authentic teacher that which in this essay will be discussed {{from the point of view}} of Fibaek Laursen (2004). A quantitative research method was used and a questionnaire asked for high school students' views on what makes a <b>good</b> <b>teacher.</b> The research revealed two results where the first result showed that amongst other things students valued most in a <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is the fair and unbiased treatment towards students. The second result showed that students consider the characteristics linked to a teacher's profession are of great importance.

2500|$|The best {{indicator}} of teacher quality, according to Dewey, {{is the ability}} to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily <b>good</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] The explanation is simple. [...] They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. [...] Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.36). [...] Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general idea}} of value added {{modeling}} {{has also been}} extended to consider principals and school leaders. [...] While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion {{about the importance of}} school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into the impact of them on student outcomes. [...] Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes. [...] This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. [...] The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. [...] Conservative estimates indicate that an effective school leader improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year. [...] These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining <b>good</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.|$|E
40|$|This {{primarily}} theoretical-philosophical {{study is}} aimed at identifying the main principles according to which a globally relevant core curriculum for teacher education could be devised at a critical juncture in human history. In order to do that, a Weberian ideal type of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is outlined. The notion of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> refers to a teacher role, with the salient associated principles and action capabilities that, by rational criteria, would be relevant to the developmental challenges and possibilities of humanity as an entity, would be acceptable in any societal context across the globe, and would draw on wisdom and knowledge from {{a broad range of}} cultures. Teachers as world makers, implying a teacher role which is based on the most salient task of a teacher being the promotion of societal transformation towards a new cosmopolitan culture, is suggested as the essence of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher.</b> Such a role is enacted in three main aspects of an inspiring driving force, a responsive explorer, and a synergizing harmonizer, each manifested in a set of guiding principles and an action repertoire. Though a theoretical construct, the ideal type of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is shown to have been instantiated in the educational practices of teachers and teacher educators, as well as in national and international policy documents. Based on the characterization of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher,</b> the main elements for developing a globally relevant core curriculum for teacher education are concluded to be transformativity, normativity, and potentiality. The study closes with a discussion of the strategic possibilities for bringing the ideal type of the globally <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> to bear upon the discourses and practices of teacher education...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{make sense}} of {{experience}} through narrative and stories. ?Narratives are a primary embodiment of {{our understanding of the}} world, our experience, and ultimately ourselves? (Kerby, 1991, p. 3). Story enlarges our capacity to understand our actions and our values and lets us talk about them (Novak, 1978, p. 63). Story is a ?mode of thinking and feeling? that facilitates people?s ability to ?create a version of the world in which, psychologically, they can envisage a place for themselves?a personal world? (Bruner, 1996, p. 39). It is also vital to the realization of that world.
