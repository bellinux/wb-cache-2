The lock block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a <b>switch</b> <b>handle</b> of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the <b>switch</b> <b>handle.</b> A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and <b>switch</b> <b>handle.</b> A lock pin is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the <b>switch</b> <b>handle.</b> Once the lock block and the <b>switch</b> <b>handle</b> are connected, the position of the <b>switch</b> <b>handle</b> is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker.

50|$|<b>Handle</b> <b>switches</b> {{are still}} used on modern trams and trains. Pneumatically or {{electrically}} linked dead-man's controls involve relatively simple modifications of the controller handle, the device that regulates traction power. If pressure is not maintained on the controller, the train's emergency brakes are applied. Typically, the controller handle is a horizontal bar, rotated {{to apply the}} required power for the train. Attached {{to the bottom of}} the handle is a rod that when pushed down contacts a solenoid or switch inside the control housing. The handle springs up if pressure is removed, releasing the rod's contact with the internal switch, instantly cutting power and applying the brakes.|$|R

However, for a network that learns a problem from examples using a local learning rule, we prove that the entropy of the problem becomes a lower bound for the connectivity of the network. The current result generalizes a previous result by removing a restriction on the features that are loaded into the neurons during the learning phase...|$|R

Moreover, to investigate whether seeing the stick inside the tube (visual feedback) improves performance, half of the subjects were tested with a transparent apparatus {{and the other half}} with an opaque apparatus. Phase 1 included (a) Training 1 in which each stick had a different handle and (b) Transfer 1 in which the <b>handles</b> were <b>switched</b> among sticks, so that the functional tool had the same length but a different handle than before. The seven chimpanzees and one capuchin that passed Transfer 1 received Transfer 2.

Eight chimpanzees and three capuchins passed Transfer 2.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{discover}} {{the family of}} Fault-Tolerant Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs) that tolerates switch faults with a minimal number of redundant switching stages. While previously known constructions <b>handled</b> <b>switch</b> faults by eliminating complete stages, our approach is to bypass faulty switches by utilizing redundant paths. As a result, {{we are able to}} construct the first known fault-tolerant MINs that are optimal in the number of redundant stages. Our fault model assumes that a faulty switch can be bypassed and our goal is to guarantee arbitrary point to point and broadcast connectivity. Under this model, we show that to tolerate f switch faults the MIN must have at least f redundant stages. We then present the explicit construction of a MIN that meets this lower-bound. This construction repeatedly uses the singleton basis of the n-dimensional vector space as the mask vectors of the MIN. We generalize this construction and prove that an n-dimensional MIN is optimally f [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} Bayesian {{tracking}} models involve auxiliary discrete vari-ables beside the main hidden state of interest. These discrete variables usually follow a Markovian process {{and interact with}} the hidden state either via its evo-lution model or via the observation process, or both. Examples of such auxiliary variables include depth ordering for occlusion <b>handling,</b> <b>switches</b> between different state dynamics, exemplar indices, etc. We consider here a general model that en-compasses all these situations, and show how Bayesian filtering can be rigorously conducted in this general setup. The resulting approach facilitates easy re-use of existing tracking algorithms designed {{in the absence of}} the auxiliary process. In particular we show how particle filters can be obtained based on sampling only in the original state space instead of sampling in the augmented space, as it is usually done. We finally demonstrate how this framework facilitates solutions to the criti-cal problem of appearance and disappearance of targets, either upon scene entering and exiting, or due to temporary occlusions. This is illustrated in the context of color-based tracking with particle filters...|$|R
