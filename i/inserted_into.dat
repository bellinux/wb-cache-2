5|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} costal vein.

CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> a linearised plasmid vector. A short extra sequence {{is added to the}} gene of interest that activates the antitoxin when the insertion occurs. This method ensures orientation-specific gene insertion.|$|E

5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped.

5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts.

One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
