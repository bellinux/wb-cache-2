25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable.

30|$|When the TPA is {{permitted}} in Scenario 3 and Scenario 4, LI will lend surplus LNG receiving capacity to entrant LT. In China, <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> usually have exclusive local distribution channels for natural gas, while SOCs have to transport and distribute natural gas nationwide. <b>Private</b> <b>companies</b> {{can make more}} profit than SOCs by saving distribution cost in LNG trading. The comprehensive production cost (including distribution cost) of SOC (LI) is 0.3 RMB/m 3, while the cost of <b>private</b> <b>company</b> LT is around 0.2 RMB/m 3. Although SOCs own LNG terminals, <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> have the comparative advantage in LNG trading. Therefore, the SOCs have the incentive to obtain extra profit by lending capacity to <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> and collect the rent fee rather than utilizing the capacity by themselves, and the <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> are also willing to allot parts of their profit as renting fee to rent the SOCs’ LNG terminal capacity. A win–win situation is reached, and the utilization ratio of LNG terminals is thus improved.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{earnings}} management in public and <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> within the Netherlands. Because public companies are exposed to various capital market pressures and share prices of public companies are influenced by reported earnings, I expect that public companies engage more in earnings management than <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> This study combines the power of two models frequently used to measure earnings management: (1) The earnings distribution model; and (2) The modified Jones model. By applying both models on my sample of financial data of 77 public companies and 3. 105 <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> between 2000 and 2009, I provide strong evidence of earnings management. The two models show evidence that both public and <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands engage in earnings management. I’m unable to provide convincing evidence that earnings management is applied more in either public or <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> The earnings distribution model shows mixed results, although the evidence of earnings management in <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> is stronger. The modified Jones model shows overwhelming evidence of more earnings management in public companies...|$|R
