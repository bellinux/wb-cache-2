5|$|The Prison in Space by Dick Sharples, {{originally}} titled The Amazons, {{returned to}} the idea of a female-dominated planet last attempted with The Hidden Planet. The Doctor and Jamie were to be imprisoned, and Zoe was to start a sexual revolution and then be brainwashed. The four-part story was commissioned on 4 June 1968 and was intended to inject humour into the show. It was to feature Jamie in drag and end with Jamie <b>deprogramming</b> Zoe by smacking her bottom. The serial was rewritten to accommodate Frazer Hines' desire to leave by introducing a new companion named Nik, and again when he later decided to stay. Scripts for the first two episodes were delivered on 27 August 1968. The production team became unhappy with the serial, and when Sharples refused to perform further rewrites, the serial was dropped. The story was replaced by The Krotons. It was later adapted as Prison in Space by Simon Guerrier for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in December 2010. In 2011, an illustrated scriptbook was released by Nothing at the End of the Lane.|$|E
25|$|Melton is a {{prominent}} critic {{of both the}} anti-cult movement and some Christian countercult organizations. Some of Melton's criticisms concerning the secular anti-cult movement revolve around his rejection {{of the concept of}} brainwashing as an explanation of religious conversion and indoctrination. During the 1970s and 1980s he was {{a prominent}} opponent of the controversial methods of <b>deprogramming.</b> He argued that <b>deprogramming</b> violated civil liberties and the religious freedom principles guaranteed in the US Constitution and that the efficacy of <b>deprogramming</b> or counter-brainwashing stratagems was doubtful.|$|E
25|$|The CFF was {{originally}} {{in favour of}} <b>deprogramming,</b> but distanced itself from the practice in the late 1970s, when it {{changed its name to}} the Cult Awareness Network. Despite this, The Cult Awareness Network also became the subject of controversy, when CAN-associated Galen Kelly and Donald Moore, were convicted in the course of carrying out deprogrammings.|$|E

25|$|The {{descriptions}} of the forcible nature of the kidnapping and <b>deprogramming</b> attempt seemed to have made {{an impact on the}} jury, who awarded $875,000 in compensatory damages to Jason Scott, and punitive damages in the amount of $1,000,000 against CAN, $2,500,000 against Ross, and $250,000 against each of Ross's two co-defendants. The court found that CAN volunteers routinely referred callers to deprogrammers.|$|E
25|$|In January 1991, at {{the time}} of the failed <b>deprogramming</b> attempt, Jason Scott, of Bellevue, Washington, was an 18-year-old member of the Life Tabernacle Church, {{affiliated}} with the United Pentecostal Church International. Scott's mother, Katherine Tonkin, had been a member of the church, but had withdrawn from it. Jason and two younger sons of hers disagreed with her decision and insisted they would remain in the church.|$|E
25|$|The Jason Scott {{case was}} a United States civil suit, brought against {{deprogrammer}} Rick Ross, two of his associates, and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), for the abduction and failed <b>deprogramming</b> of Jason Scott, {{a member of a}} Pentecostalist church. Scott was eighteen {{years old at the time}} of the abduction and thus legally an adult. CAN was a co-defendant because a CAN contact person had referred Scott's mother to Rick Ross. In the trial, Jason Scott was represented by Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{including}} the Branch Davidians, Church Universal and Triumphant, the Church of Satan, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments, the Peoples Temple, Heaven's Gate, and the Unification Church {{are discussed in}} the book. Snow recounts results from a study of 353 former members of 48 cults in the United States, who recounted experiences after leaving their respective groups. After leaving the groups, 23 percent of former members stated they had attempted suicide, 63 percent had suicidal ideation, and 93 percent had experienced anxiety attacks. Snow devotes a chapter to <b>deprogramming</b> and advice on how individuals can avoid joining these groups from the outset.|$|E
25|$|After four days, Scott {{began to}} pretend that he had changed his mind, feigning tears and remorse, {{in the hope that}} this would in due course {{give him a chance to}} escape. The final day of his {{imprisonment}} he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the <b>deprogramming</b> session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross {{about the ways in}} which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the <b>deprogramming</b> had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Others {{have claimed}} that Process Work as a therapy is hard to define and has {{similarities}} with 'faith healing', raising hopes about the healing of physical illness (though it is reported that Mindell explicitly discourages this idea). Like other transpersonal psychologies, process oriented psychology has been identified by critics as a method having 'a mystical or supernaturalistic application, theory, significance, or pedigree.' In 1997, a Japanese scientist involved in <b>deprogramming</b> members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult mentioned process oriented psychology {{as an example of}} recent psychotherapeutic paradigms that draw on Asian philosophy, Gestalt, Jung and transpersonal psychology, and claimed that, while 'these programs are not substantively dangerous', the methods may be used adversely and have {{the potential to be a}} form of 'mind control'. He then clarified that process oriented psychology was not amongst those that were dangerous. Mindell's (1993) book, Leader as Martial Artist, has been critiqued as a use of Eastern belief systems to justify capitalist business practice.|$|E
500|$|Born in the Iraqi Kurdistan in 1983 {{during the}} Iranâ€“Iraq War, she {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} her family and thousands of others from a chemical attack by Saddam Hussein's government troops against the rebellious Kurds when she was five years old. She was captured by Saddam's forces and taken as an orphan by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, who brainwashed her and brought a famed Gurkha sniper to train her to be a child combatant for the government. Three years later, during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, she fled to a Kurdish refugee camp. There, the legendary U.S. Army Special Forces veteran known as Big Boss noticed her extroardinary abilities and brought her with him to the United States, where she received counselling and <b>deprogramming</b> to remove her Iraqi brainwashing, leaving only her fighting abilities with her. Extremely grateful, she thought of Big Boss as a modern Saladin and followed him in whatever he did, until his mutiny and later death at the hands of FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake (as depicted in [...] ). She was then found by Solid Snake's brother Liquid Snake, who convinced her to join a FOXHOUND splinter cell under his command.|$|E
500|$|Chris Turner's book [...] {{describes}} the Movementarians as {{a cross between}} the Church of Scientology and RaÃ«lism, with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Planet Simpson also notes the Simpsons' chant {{at the conclusion of}} the episode as evidence of a [...] "true high-growth quasi-religious cult of our time", referring to television. The book refers to a [...] "Cult of Pop", which it describes as [...] "a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West's social fabric where organized religion used to be". Martin Hunt of FACTnet notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology. [...] "The Leader" [...] physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard; the Movementarians' [...] "trillion year labor contract" [...] alludes to the (Scientology) Sea Org's billion year contract; and both groups make extensive use of litigation. The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called [...] "Springfield joins a cult", comparing the Movementarians' plans to travel to [...] "Blisstonia" [...] to Heaven's Gate's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Haleâ€“Bopp. However, it also notes that [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] is a commentary on organized religion in general, quoting Bart as saying, [...] "Church, cult, cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday." [...] Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons approach to <b>deprogramming</b> in the episode, noting groundskeeper Willie's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to deprogram Homer. Author Chris Turner suggests that Marge should have instead gone with the [...] "Conformco Brain Deprogrammers" [...] used in the episode [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] to convince Bart to leave Mr. Burns and come back home.|$|E
5000|$|In the Simpsons episode [...] "The Joy of Sect", most of Springfield joins a new sect called The Movementarians, led by {{the mysterious}} [...] "Leader" [...] who persuades most {{residents}} {{to give up their}} material possessions to him. A skeptical Marge tries desperately to <b>deprogram</b> her family with the help of Reverend Lovejoy, one of the few town residents not to join the sect, and of Willie (who offers to [...] "kidnap Homer for fifty, <b>deprogram</b> him for a hundred, or kill him for five hundred"). Eventually they kidnap Homer and [...] "deprogram" [...] him with beer. The Leader is then revealed to be a con-artist and the whole town return to normal.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Papapetros {{spoke to}} law-enforcement {{officials}} about the Jim Jones mass-suicide case in Guyana.

50|$|Some of the <b>deprogrammed</b> adults {{sued the}} deprogrammers or the {{relatives}} who had hired them. Also in 1987, psychologist Margaret Singer became unusable {{as an expert}} witness after the American Psychological Association (APA) rejected her Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) report.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{religion}} scholar J. Gordon Melton, {{head of the}} Institute for the Study of American Religion at UC Santa Barbara, [...] "The Scott case virtually brought <b>deprogramming</b> {{to a halt in}} this country" [...] "What this judgment does [...] [...] [...] is cut the communication lines that allow <b>deprogramming</b> to go forward" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jason Scott case in 1995 {{demonstrated}} the ongoing {{involvement of the}} [...] "Old CAN" [...] in <b>deprogramming</b> referrals. Also, in 1993, deprogrammer Galen Kelly's trial following another botched <b>deprogramming</b> attempt had revealed that the [...] "Old CAN" [...] had, contrary to its stated policy, paid Kelly a monthly stipend during the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Nora Hamerman, {{in writing}} about the Dobkowski <b>deprogramming,</b> {{referred}} to CAN as [...] "a clearinghouse for kidnap-for-hire rings", referring to the [...] "financial symbiosis between CAN and coercive deprogrammers".|$|E

50|$|Two of the Al-Qaida spokesmen {{appearing}} in the video identified themselves as former Guantanamo captives, and graduates of the Care rehabilitation center, a Saudi facility intended to <b>deprogram</b> former jihadists.

50|$|After Pearl Harbor, the US {{military}} asked {{pet owners}} to donate their pet dogs {{to the war}} effort. The name of this program was Dogs for Defense. The dogs were trained and used for guard and patrol duties. To encourage the donation, they also advertised a program where the dogs would be <b>deprogrammed</b> after the war.|$|R
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} the <b>deprogramming,</b> Ross {{put together a}} two-man [...] "security team". The three traveled to the grandmother's home, locked the two youngest children in the basement, and following several days of argument and lecturing, the boys gave up their Pentecostal beliefs. For <b>deprogramming</b> Jason, Ross demanded a larger fee, {{in view of the}} fact that he was powerfully built and legally an adult, increasing the risk of prosecution. Ross hired a karate black belt named Clark Rotroff to help with the operation. One evening, as Scott returned to the family residence, he was surprised by Ross's three associates, wrestled to the ground, and dragged into a waiting van.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the criminal trial, a civil suit for damages was filed against Ross, the two convicted associates and CAN by Kendrick Moxon, a long-time member and counsel for the Church of Scientology, on behalf of Jason Scott. Moxon took the case pro bono. The case led to renewed debate on the <b>deprogramming</b> issue. At the trial, the jury was tasked {{to decide whether the}} defendants had violated Scott's civil rights, including the right [...] "to practice and believe in the religion of his choice, free from force, violence, threats, retaliation or intimidation." [...] Anson Shupe appeared in the trial as an expert academic witness for Scott, giving testimony as to [...] "the entrepreneurial nature of <b>deprogramming</b> and its origins in religious intolerance".|$|E
2500|$|Ross's {{defense lawyer}} argued that since Scott was powerfully built, {{it had made}} sense to bring along others [...] "for security", but that Ross's role had been [...] "limited to {{counseling}} and providing information". [...] "Mr. Ross had no physical contact with Mr. Scott," [...] his attorney said. [...] "He did what he was intended to do â€“ provide information." [...] CAN's defense asserted that none of CAN's leaders or employees {{were aware of the}} <b>deprogramming.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Patrick {{attempted}} to <b>deprogram</b> Elma Miller, an Amish {{woman who had}} joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney.|$|R
50|$|Scott later {{reconciled}} with his mother, who had originally hired Ross to <b>deprogram</b> him. Scott terminated his lawyer, Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney, and was persuaded {{by his mother}} to settle with Ross. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, the two agreed that Ross would pay Scott 5,000 and provide 200 hours of his professional services.|$|R
50|$|The Church vehemently {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the trust. They levelled many accusations against it including allegations that the trust was violently attempting to <b>deprogram</b> ex-Scientologists. Scientology hired off-duty police officers, who were paid close to $150,000 over the course of 15 months, to ensure that trust members stayed 10 ft away from Scientology buildings and parishioners at all times.|$|R
