5|$|At 12:00UTC on September4, the NHC {{downgraded}} Fred to {{a tropical}} depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked {{back up to}} tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence. Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance {{a few hundred miles}} east of Bermuda began to erode the southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> circumnavigated for most of its journey. This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September6. Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings. It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00UTC, degenerating into a trough 1,210mi (1,945km) southwest of the Azores and later merging with a frontal boundary nearby.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of September8, an eye began to develop within a central dense overcast. Later that day, Fred intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds estimated at 75mph (120km/h). By the morning of September9, satellite imagery depicted that <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> undergone rapid intensification and attained Category 2 status. This resulted from {{the formation of a}} 12mi (19km) wide eye due to low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. This intensification continued for several more hours, ending with Fred attaining satellite-estimated its peak intensity as a solid Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg), making it the second strongest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred {{displaced}} {{more than}} 50families and caused CVE$250million ($2.5million) in damage, {{mostly to the}} agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane {{to move through the}} islands with documented impacts, as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E

5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

25|$|When {{questioned}} as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose {{claimed she}} and <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> lived separate lives, although this was {{inconsistent with the}} earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at their address. In reference to {{her relationship with her}} eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained, before claiming to the court her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after the girl had left home.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day (26 February), police began excavating {{the section of}} the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had buried his daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human thigh bone protruding from a section of the garden <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> insisted police need not look in. Excavating {{the section of the}} garden where <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> indicated he had buried his daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, although one kneecap and several phalange bones were missing, and her fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via dental records as being that of Heather West.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the 12 confirmed victims, police firmly believe Fred is also responsible for the 1968 disappearance of 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, but to date no body has been found. West's son, Stephen, has said he firmly believes the missing teenager was an early victim of his father, as <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> openly boasted of having committed Bastholm's murder while on remand.

It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts—willing or unwilling—to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for their satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|Trump's {{first big}} deal in Manhattan was the {{development}} of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978 next to Grand Central Terminal. The aging brick facade of the Commodore Hotel was sheathed in glass, and the existing lobby of the hotel was replaced by an atrium. The Commodore was thus presented as a remodeled Hyatt hotel at its opening in September 1980, helping to bring Trump to public prominence. Part of this deal was a $1million loan Fred Trump's Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan credit line <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> arranged for Donald as he built the hotel, as well as a $70million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles, after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Donald the front man in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred's two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project. Donald negotiated a 40-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city, in exchange for a share of the venture's profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.|$|E

Leach testified that through this role, <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> gradually begun to view her as a confidante, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a pact whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being [...] "some of Rose's mistakes". He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. <b>Fred</b> <b>had</b> also confided that although he had actually dismembered the victims, Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, and had personally removed Robinson's unborn child from her womb after her death.
