5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. <b>Ion</b> <b>beam</b> deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.

5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium <b>ion</b> <b>beam.</b> He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L.

Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|To predict if the {{production}} of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to {{the product of the}} number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible {{to go ahead with the}} experiment. The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week half-life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.|$|E

Proton beams have bigger width of the Bragg peak and broader lateral dose distribution than carbon <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> for the same position of Bragg peaks.

40|$|In this work, we {{characterized}} the surface damage layer and sputtering yield of polycrystalline L-leucine films {{before and after}} irradiation with Ar cluster or monomer <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry.

By doing so, it bypasses the Carnot cycle and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40–45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors.

40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CME's) {{are thought}} to result {{from the loss of}} {{stability}} within a magnetically confined coronal structure leading to its radial expansion into interplanetary space. As the CME expands into the corona current sheets will form between the expanding CME and surrounding field lines in the ambient wind. This configuration may lead to reconnection between the CME and adjacemt field lines. Such reconnection may produce double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> as has been observed in the terrrestrial magnetosphere. We examine all 24 distinct signatures of CME's observed by Ulysses during the in-ecliptic portion of the mission. In 5 of these 24 cases the ion spectra were not clear and thus the presence of double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> could not be determined. In 13 of the remaining 19 CME's double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> were found on the leading and/or trailing edge of the CME but not in the interior of the CME. In 3 of the CME's double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> were found throughout the CME while in the remaining 3 CME's double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> were not present near or just inside of the CME. In contrast in a control sample of 19 randomly chosen intervals, double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> were present at the leading and/or trailing edges of the random intervals in only 3 of the 19 cases. There appears to be no correlation between probability of occurrence of double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> and a magnetic cloud or non-cloud configuration of the CME and no correlation between the presence of the double <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> {{at the edges of the}} CME and the CME being a fast or slow CME...|$|R

40|$|Laser cooling of {{relativistic}} heavy <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> of Li-like C$^{ 3 +}$ and O$^{ 4 +}$ {{is being}} in preparation at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe). Recently, a preparatory experiment to test important prerequisites for laser cooling of relativistic $^{ 12 }$C$^{ 3 +}$ <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> using a pulsed laser {{system has been}} performed at the CSRe. Unfortunately, {{the interaction between the}} ions and the pulsed laser cannot be detected. In order to study the laser cooling process and find the optimized parameters for future laser cooling experiment, a multi-particle tracking method was developed to simulate the detailed longitudinal dynamics of laser-cooled <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> at the CSRe. The simulations of laser cooling of the $^{ 12 }$C$^{ 3 +}$ <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> by scanning the frequency of RF-buncher or continuous wave (CW) laser wavelength were performed. The simulation results indicated that a large momentum spread <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> could be laser-cooled by the combination of only one CW laser and the RF-buncher and shown the requirements of a successful laser cooling experiment. The optimized parameters for scanning the RF-buncher frequency or laser frequency were obtained. Furthermore, the heating effects were estimated for laser cooling at the CSRe. The Schottky noise spectra of longitudinally modulated and laser-cooled <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> was simulated to fully explain and anticipate the experimental results. The combination of Schottky spectra from the highly sensitive resonant Schottky pick-up and the simulation methods developed in this paper will be helpful to investigate the longitudinal dynamics of RF-bunched and ultra-cold <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> in the upcoming laser cooling experiments at the CSRe.

25|$|More {{recently}} focused <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> {{methods have}} been used to prepare samples. FIB is a relatively new technique to prepare thin samples for TEM examination from larger specimens. Because FIB can be used to micro-machine samples very precisely, it is possible to mill very thin membranes from a specific area of interest in a sample, such as a semiconductor or metal. Unlike inert gas ion sputtering, FIB makes use of significantly more energetic gallium ions and may alter the composition or structure of the material through gallium implantation.|$|E
25|$|Colloidal {{lithography}} is {{inexpensive and}} can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> bombardment or film evaporation is used to etch away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.|$|E
25|$|Secondary ion mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) {{is a method}} very similar to FAB in that a beam of particles is fired against {{the surface of a}} sample in order to cause sputtering, in which the molecules of the sample ionize and leave the surface, thus allowing for the ions or the sample to be analyzed. The primary difference is that in SIMS, an <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> is fired against the surface, but in FAB, an atom beam is fired against the surface. The other primary difference, of more interest to this page, is that, unlike FAB, SIMS is typically performed on a solid sample with little sample preparation required.|$|E
40|$|Uncertainties {{surround}} the radiobiological consequences {{of exposure to}} charged particles, despite {{the increasing use of}} accelerated <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> for cancer treatment (hadrontherapy). In particular, {{little is known about the}} long-term effects on normal tissue at the beam entrance or in the distal part of the Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP). Moreover, although the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of particle radiation has been traditionally related to the radiation linear energy transfer (LET), it has become increasingly evident that radiation-induced cell death, as well as long term radiation effects, is not adequately described by this parameter. Hence, exploring the effectiveness of various <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> at or around the Bragg peak of monoenergetic <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> can prove useful to gain insights into the role played by parameters other than the particle LET in determining the outcome of particle radiation exposures. In this context, the upgrade of the Tandem irradiation facility at Naples University here described, has allowed us to perform a series of preliminary radiobiological measurements using proton and carbon <b>ion</b> <b>beams.</b> The facility is currently used to irradiate normal and cancer cell lines with <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> such as oxygen and fluorine...|$|R

Time-of-flight (TOF) measurement showed that the peak mass number was approximately 5000 for positive and negative BMIM-PF_ 6 <b>ion</b> <b>beams.</b> This indicated that BMIM-PF_ 6 clusters with a size of a few tens of molecules were produced.

25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, another thing that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E
25|$|The most {{promising}} method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This {{is known as}} coated conductor. Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape itself (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, {{with the aid of}} an <b>ion</b> <b>beam,</b> on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.|$|E
25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and <b>ion</b> <b>beam).</b> The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
