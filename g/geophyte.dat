25|$|Gilliesieae is a {{tribe of}} {{herbaceous}} <b>geophyte</b> plants {{belonging to the}} subfamily Allioideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). Described in 1826, it contains fifteen genera and about eighty species. It has been variously treated as a subfamily or tribe. It is native to the Southern United States, Central and South America, predominantly Chile. Of the three tribes of genera {{that make up the}} subfamily Allioideae, Gilliesieae is the largest and most variable. The tribe was divided into two tribes in 2014, Gilliesiae s.s. and Leucocoryneae, based on differences in floral symmetry and septal nectaries.|$|E
500|$|The Liliaceae {{are widely}} distributed, but {{mainly in the}} {{temperate}} regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The centre of diversity is from southwest Asia to China. Their distribution is diverse, mainly in plains, steppes, and alpine meadows, but also in deciduous forests, Mediterranean scrub and arctic tundra. Tulipa and Gagea provide examples of ornamental <b>geophyte</b> biomorphological types representing continental thermoperiodic zones (Irano-Turanian region), characterised by cessation of underground growth at high temperatures in early summer and requiring low winter temperatures for spring flowering. While some genera are shade-dwelling, such as the Medeoleae, and [...] Streptopoideae, Tricyrtis, and Cardiocrinum, others prefer a more open habitat.|$|E

40|$|Drought {{tolerance}} {{was determined}} in 45 species/cultivars of 29 genera of seven families of <b>geophytes.</b> Salt water irrigation at concentrations of 0, 500, 1000, 5, 000 mgl^ was used. Fourteen species/cultivars with no salt treatment （control） either did not flower or flowered {{at very low}} rates. This was probably because no fiowers were initiated or flower buds aborted at high temperatures of greenhouse. The remaining 29 species/cultivars were classified into eight categories using three fiowering characteristics （flowering rate, plant height and days to flower） to the salt treatments. Flower characteristics were not affected in Muscari armeniacum with 5, 000 mgl^ salt treatment. Thus {{it was the most}} drought tolerant among the <b>geophytes</b> examined. In other <b>geophytes,</b> at least one characteristic was more or less affeeted by the treatment. Generally, 　spring-flowering <b>geophytes</b> tended to be more tolerant than summer-flowering <b>geophytes.</b> However, there were no clear relationships between families, classified categories and the types of storage organs (bulbs, corms, etc.). Salt (drought) tolerance in <b>geophytes</b> appears to be species/cultiver-specific...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{organs of}} 63 geophytic species, {{representing}} eight families of Monocotyledonae and five families of Dicotyledonae, {{native to the}} winter-rainfall region of South Africa, were analysed for their polysaccharide storage components. With respect to type of polysaccharide accumulated in the storage organs the species tested {{can be divided into}} three groups: 1) <b>geophytes</b> storing starch, II) <b>geophytes</b> storing fructan, III) <b>geophytes</b> storing both, fructan and starch. Most of the <b>geophytes</b> tested showed a capacity for storing large to massive amounts of polysaccharides. Starch and/or fructan contribute more than 40 % to total dry mass of the underground storage organs. Within a family or a genus, species cannot naturally be placed in one group, e. g. members of the genus Ornithogalum or Lachenalia store either fructan or a combination of fructan and starch in the underground storage organs. However, all <b>geophytes</b> belonging to group III are members of the Monocotyledonae. In underground storage organs fructan was previously considered to be one alternative to starch: species rich in fructan do not accumulate more than traces of starch and vice versa. This survey demonstrates that this assumption can not be confirmed in the results for the underground storage organs of the South African <b>geophytes.</b> The majority of <b>geophytes</b> belonging to group III accumulated more than 20 % of the total amount of polysaccharides as the minor component. In these <b>geophytes</b> fructan is accumulated in addition to and not as an alternative to starch...|$|R

40|$|In vitro {{flowering}} is advantageous, {{especially for}} species {{with a long}} juvenile period like <b>geophytes.</b> The reviewed studies showed that in vitro conditions significantly shortened the juvenile period in <b>geophytes.</b> Media components, level of plant growth regulators (PGR), and culture conditions affect in vitro flowering, as does the physiological stage of the mother plant and the organ or tissue source of the explant. Thus, in vitro conditions can be manipulated and provide an alternative controlled system necessary to study flower induc-tion, as well as inflorescence and flower morphogenesis. It can also be applied {{as a tool to}} accelerate breeding programs or can be adjusted to commercial production of specific compounds from floral organs. The levels and ratio of promoting and retarding PGR in the medium were found to be strongly correlated with the initia-tion and development of floral organs from buds or callus tissue. Recently, PGR levels were shown to affect gene regulation of floral organ development in vitro. This review covers various aspects of controlling flower induction and development of <b>geophytes</b> in vitro. The review emphasizes the importance of the tissue culture system as a tool to study various aspects of flowering control for the potential advancement of <b>geophytes</b> in the ornamental, food, medicinal, and craft industries...|$|R
