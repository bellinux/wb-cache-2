2500|$|Batteries may {{be harmful}} or <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Small button cells can be swallowed, in {{particular}} by young children. While in the digestive tract, the battery's electrical discharge {{may lead to}} tissue damage; such damage is occasionally serious {{and can lead to}} death. Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus {{is a function of the}} patient's age and battery size. Disk batteries of 16mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year. [...] Older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 21–23mm. Liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery (usually at the anode). Perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth section, {{with orange}} page borders, {{includes}} the actual response guides. Each of the 62 guides provides safety recommendations and directions {{on how to}} proceed during the initial response phase (first thirty minutes) of the incident. It includes [...] "health" [...] and [...] "fire or explosion" [...] potential hazard information (with the more dangerous hazard listed first). For example, [...] "the material gives off irritating vapors, easily ignited by heat, reactive with water"; [...] "highly toxic, may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> inhaled, <b>swallowed</b> or absorbed through skin"; etc. [...] Next this section includes information for responders on appropriate protective clothing and possible evacuation information for either spill or fire is given. It also includes information on fighting fires (example, do not apply water to sodium), warnings for spills or leaks, and special directions for first aid (example, not to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the materials are toxic).|$|R

50|$|Lead oxide may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed</b> or inhaled. It causes {{irritation}} to skin, eyes, {{and respiratory}} tract. It affects gum tissue, central nervous system, kidneys, blood, and reproductive system. It can bioaccumulate in plants and in mammals.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{a primary}} component, in older and original-style {{dishwasher}} detergent powders [...] Highly alkaline salts attack and dissolve grease, but are extremely corrosive (<b>fatal)</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Salts used may include metasilicates, alkali metal hydroxides, Sodium carbonate etc.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Aminopyridine {{can easily}} be absorbed through the skin. It is <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed</b> or absorbed through the skin. High {{concentrations}} can be extremely destructive to the tissues of mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract eyes and skin. Symptoms may also include convulsions and death. It also causes damage to the nervous system. Thermal decomposition leads to evolution of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|However, King Pharmaceuticals voluntarily {{recalled}} Embeda in 2011 after {{complaints from}} the FDA {{in regard to}} King Pharmaceuticals omitting information regarding the potentially <b>fatal</b> reaction <b>if</b> crushed and <b>swallowed</b> and also for making unsubstantiated claims regarding Embeda's reduced abuse potential.|$|R

50|$|Edible printer inks {{have now}} become {{prevalent}} and are {{used in conjunction with}} special ink printers. Ink that is not specifically marketed as being edible may be harmful or <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Edible toner for laser printers is not currently available. Any inkjet or bubblejet printer can be used to print, although resolution may be poor, and care should be taken to avoid contaminating the edible inks with previously used inks. Inkjet or bubblejet printers can be converted to print using edible ink, and cartridges of edible ink are commercially available.|$|E
50|$|According to a manufacturer, {{potential}} hazards include violent reaction {{with water}} {{and the production of}} explosive hydrogen vapors upon contact with most metals; chronic (delayed) and acute (immediate) health hazards if inhaled, ingested, or contacted, including severe eye, flesh and skin burns or even permanent visual loss, inflammation of respiratory membranes, and corrosive burns to all human tissue. It may even be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Due to the vigorous reaction between the acid and water, such acidic drain openers should be added slowly into the pipe to be cleaned.|$|E
50|$|Charcoal {{lighter fluid}} is a {{volatile}} fluid used {{to accelerate the}} ignition of charcoal in a barbecue grill. It can either be petroleum based (e.g., mineral spirits) or alcohol based (usually methanol or ethanol). It can be used both with lump charcoal and briquettes. Lighter-fluid infused briquettes, that {{eliminate the need for}} separate application of lighter fluid, are available. The use of lighter fluid is somewhat controversial as the substance is combustible, harmful or <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed,</b> and may impart an unpleasant flavor to food cooked upon fires lit with it. A traditional alternative to using lighter fluid is a chimney starter.|$|E

50|$|Cyanogen iodide is toxic {{if inhaled}} or {{ingested}} and may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed</b> or absorbed through the skin. Cyanogen iodide may cause convulsions, paralysis and death from respiratory failure. It is a strong irritant and may cause burns to the eyes and skin if contact is encountered. If cyanogen iodide is heated enough to undergo complete decomposition, it may releases toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides, cyanide and iodide. A fire may cause the release of poisonous gas. Cyanogen iodide decomposes when contacted with acids, bases, ammonia, alcohols, and with heating. ICN slowly reacts with water or carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

30|$|All {{products}} scrutinized contain hazardous ingredients. In many cases, {{the concentrations}} of a hazardous chemical in the products were many {{times higher than the}} thresholds for classification. The ‘eye zone cream’ is the only product in the selection that would not need to be classified and labelled. However, it contains 71.9 % water as solvent for the active ingredients. If in the course of application near the eye, half of the water amount evaporated, the product would have to be classified as ‘Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye irritation.’ and labelled with the GHS 07 pictogram (acute hazard). It {{is interesting to note that}} even some liquid products which contain more than 50 % water would need to be classified. There are products where less than 10 % of the ingredients were considered for classification and labelling, the rest being water or substances with unclear toxicity, which would have to be classified as mixture. Two products for the same purpose can be classified very differently, e.g. one insect repellent would have to be classified as ‘Causes serious eye irritation.’ and ‘May cause an allergic skin reaction.’, the other as ‘Suspected of damaging fertility of the unborn child.’ One massage oil is classified as ‘May be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed</b> and enters airways.’, whereas the so-called carbon-free massage oil is classified as ‘May cause an allergic skin reaction.’.|$|E
