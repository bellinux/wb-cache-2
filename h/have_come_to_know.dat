5|$|I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{that there}} is a real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I {{do not believe that the}} German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Endecott's life before his {{association}} with colonisation efforts in the 1620s. He was known to Sir Edward Coke, and may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Roger Williams through this connection. He was highly literate, and spoke French. Some early colonial documents refer to him as [...] "Captain Endecott", indicating some military experience, and other records suggest he had some medical training.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{was a great}} {{showcase}} for not only each of the characters, but the setting of Pawnee as well, and that the episode [...] "illustrated each part of Pawnee that we <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and love so much". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix had the [...] "both the scope and the out-of-control but not frantic style" [...] of [...] "The Harvest Festival". He also enjoyed the scene with Leslie and Ben, and said he believed the show could get great [...] "comic mileage" [...] out of their continued secret relationship together. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin called the episode a [...] "tour de force that expertly wrapped up an excellent season". Garrett said the show's characters were [...] "so vivid and instantly memorable" [...] that the death of Li'l Sebastian really felt like a major event, {{even though he had}} only previously appeared in one other episode. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also enjoyed seeing Tom succeed with his concert, and claimed the Li'l Sebastian funeral scene was surprisingly powerful.|$|E
2500|$|Opening passage. “God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him” (1 Jn 4:16). These {{words from}} the First Letter of John express with {{remarkable}} clarity {{the heart of the}} Christian faith: the Christian image of God and the resulting image of mankind and its destiny. In the same verse, Saint John also offers a kind of summary of the Christian life: “We <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and to believe in the love God has for us”. We have come to believe in God's love: in these words the Christian can express the fundamental decision of his life. (§1) ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 1872, as {{covered by}} the Washington Star, Mosby {{personally}} thanked now-U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for that document. Mosby also told Grant he believed vehemently that election of Horace Greeley (a long-time editor of the New York Tribune detested in the South) would be worse for the South because the men surrounding him were worse than those surrounding his old benefactor Grant. A few days later, Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Butler presented an amnesty bill for former Confederates, as Mosby had suggested in that meeting, and soon President Grant signed it into law. After Greeley became the Democratic party's nominee in July, Mosby became Grant's campaign manager in Virginia, and an active Republican, although he also made sure the Republicans would not run a candidate against his friend and fellow Warrenton attorney Eppa Hunton, who campaigned and won as a Democrat. In his autobiography Grant stated, [...] "Since {{the close of the}} war, I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately. He is a different man entirely from what I supposed. ... He is able and thoroughly honest and truthful." ...|$|E
