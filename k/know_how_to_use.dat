5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself {{in other parts of}} his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

5|$|On their journey, they {{encounter}} Phineas, the blind human who helped Jason, {{leader of the}} Argonauts on his journey, and befriend a harpy named Ella that supposedly torments him. They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber {{with a plan to}} destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant children are being woken, each of whom is matched to fight a their counterpart god. Each Giant has the skills to oppose one god and they can only be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. This proves to be difficult. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their powers and have self-confidence. Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats him with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives setting up the plot for The Mark of Athena.|$|E

Thus these were widely used chiefly because many residents did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Latin alphabet, thus these “runes” were widely employed.

25|$|The {{department}} had serious problems: The dispatching system {{could not identify}} {{the exact location of}} structures like the United States Capitol or the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dispatchers sent crews to the wrong locations or in the wrong directions, firefighters didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> life-saving emergency equipment such as defibrillators, injuries to civilians during fires were on the increase, fire engines and ambulances were having more accidents while responding to calls, and ambulances took twice as long to respond to calls (11 minutes and 21 seconds) than the national average. The training structures at the fire academy were in serious disrepair, trainees were found extensively cheating on tests, there were equipment and employee shortages, and equipment was old and in disrepair. Three firefighters died in 1999 in two months, creating a deep morale problem. (Prior to the incidents, just a single firefighter had died in 11 years.) Few had little experience overseeing the provision of emergency medical care, although 80 percent of calls in D.C. were of that nature. Few was also only the second fire chief hired from outside the department, and had extremely poor relations with the firefighter's union.|$|E

500|$|As the Texians {{struggled}} to find men and supplies, Santa Anna continued to gather men at San Luis Potosi; {{by the end of}} 1835 his army numbered 6,019 soldiers. Rather than advance along the coast, where supplies and reinforcements could be easily delivered by sea, Santa Anna ordered his army inland to Béxar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's defeat. The army began its march north in late December. [...] Officers used the long journey to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the sights of their guns, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the large recoil.|$|E
500|$|More {{than merely}} passive {{resistance}} was expected—or at least hoped for—from the population. Churchill considered {{the formation of}} a Home Guard Reserve, given only an armband and basic training on the use of simple weapons such as Molotov cocktails. The reserve would only have been expected to report for duty in an invasion. Later, Churchill wrote how he envisaged the use of the sticky bomb: [...] "We had the picture in mind that devoted soldiers or civilians would run close up to the tank and even thrust the bomb upon it, though its explosion cost them their lives [...]" [...] The prime minister practised shooting, and told wife Clementine and daughter in law Pamela that he expected them each to kill one or two Germans. When Pamela protested that she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a gun, Churchill told her to use a kitchen butcher knife as [...] "You can always take a Hun with you".

500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E

Leonardi always talked about it. [...] "These people shouldn't have weapons they don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> They should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them. They should carry them properly. Keep them within reach. The radio should be operational, but it doesn't work." [...] For months it {{had been going on}} like this. Marshal Leonardi and lance corporal Ricci did not expect an ambush, because their weapons were placed in the bag and one of the two holsters was even in a plastic liner."

2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the ATM and they're taking forever?
