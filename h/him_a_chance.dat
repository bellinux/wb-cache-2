Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at a comeback.

5|$|In Chains of Olympus, Kratos was {{reluctant}} to help the gods when Helios was kidnapped, and openly abandoned them when Persephone offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to be reunited with}} his daughter. Kratos, however, was forced to reverse his decision when Persephone used the Titan Atlas in a bid to destroy the world and in turn, the spirit of Calliope. Knowing that while intervention would save Calliope, it would separate him from his family forever, a bitter Kratos killed Persephone, imprisoned Atlas, and freed Helios.|$|E

Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a}} dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} he died Rindt had won five of that year's ten Grands Prix, which meant {{that he had a}} {{substantial}} lead in the Drivers' Championship.

At the United States Grand Prix, a race won by Rindt's replacement at Lotus, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing's only posthumous world champion. The championship trophy was handed to his widow Nina by Jackie Stewart on 18 November 1970 in a ceremony near the Place de la Concorde in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Cogan joined Gillingham in June 2007, being tipped by {{new manager}} Ronnie Jepson {{to fill the}} void left by Matt Jarvis, who had joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut for Gillingham in the 3–0 defeat at Watford in the League Cup on 14 August, and scored his first goal for the club in the 3–1 home victory over Leyton Orient on 2 October 2007. Following a string of bad results, Jepson resigned, and Mark Stimson was named as his {{permanent}} replacement in November 2007. Stimson saw Cogan as surplus to requirements, and offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to go out on loan in February 2008. He rejected this initial chance, but subsequently joined Grays Athletic for a month on 14 March 2008, scoring five goals in thirteen Conference National matches. Gillingham released Cogan {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season, after he made just 21 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|It {{was awarded}} the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, {{credited}} to Aaron Sorkin and Rick Cleveland. In the summer of 2001, a public argument broke out between the two on the internet forum mightybigtv.com (later known as Television Without Pity). Cleveland claimed {{to have had the}} original idea, based on the experiences of his father who was a Korean War veteran, and felt offended that Sorkin had not given <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to honor his father’s memory at the award ceremony. Sorkin responded that Cleveland had not contributed significantly, and that writing credits were simply rotated among the staff writers. The argument ended amicably, with Sorkin apologizing for belittling Cleveland's effort and the two writers expressing their admiration for each other.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

In February 2010, DiBiase defeated Mark Henry in an Elimination Chamber qualifying match, earning {{a chance to win}} the WWE Championship. At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, he eliminated Orton from the Elimination Chamber match, but was eliminated by Kofi Kingston soon after. On the February 22 episode of Raw, Orton turned on The Legacy, believing they had a plan to turn on him, and in retaliation, they attacked Orton the following week. As a result, the three competed in a triple threat match at WrestleMania XXVI in which Orton defeated Rhodes and DiBiase.|$|E
5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that {{this is probably the}} longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that {{because there are a lot}} of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May, Drogba helped Chelsea {{to win the}} Premier League {{by scoring}} a hat-trick in an 8–0 win over Wigan Athletic. In doing so, he not only {{collected}} his third League winner's medal but also won the Golden Boot for the season, his second time doing so, by topping the chart with 29 league goals, beating Wayne Rooney to the title who remained on 26 goals. Both players had {{the same number of}} goals (26) before the start of their respective matches. However, during the game, Drogba appeared to be clearly angry with teammate and regular penalty taker Frank Lampard, after Lampard refused to let Drogba take a penalty which would lead Chelsea to go 2–0 up and give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the golden boot. Lampard scored the penalty, but Drogba did not celebrate with his teammates. Later on in the game though Ashley Cole was tripped in the box when Chelsea were already 5–0 up, and this time Lampard allowed Drogba to take the penalty, which he scored to go two goals clear of Rooney.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest {{in the first}} free practice session, run in clear and sunny conditions, lapping {{in a time of}} 1m43.754s, over one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg had set new fastest sector times on his last fast run, but a mistake in {{the last part of the}} track lost <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at the best time. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest for Ferrari, ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Ricciardo changed back to his older specification Renault power unit, after being unsatisfied with the performance of his updated unit at the previous race in Brazil. He finished the session seventh fastest. At Lotus, Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean, but had to sit out most of the session due to a water leak, managing just nine laps.|$|E

Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E
