The city's great financiers, however, were less important in decision making than the policy makers in Washington, and very high wartime taxes were not offset by heavy war spending. New York was not a center of heavy industry and did not see a wartime boom, as defense plants were built elsewhere. FDR refused to make La Guardia a general {{and was unable to}} provide <b>fresh</b> <b>money</b> for the city. By 1944 the city was short of funds to pay for La Guardia's new programs.|$|E
2500|$|Fannie Mae is a {{purchaser}} of mortgages, {{which it}} packages into MBS. Fannie Mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them; it then sells the resultant mortgage-backed security to {{investors in the}} secondary mortgage market, along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investor.. In addition, Fannie MBS, like those of Freddie Mac MBS and Ginnie Mae MBS, are eligible to be traded in the [...] "to-be-announced," [...] or [...] "TBA" [...] market. By purchasing the mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide banks and other financial institutions with <b>fresh</b> <b>money</b> to make new loans. This gives the United States housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity.|$|E
60|$|The {{government}} of Florence had shown a great heart in this urgent need, meeting losses and defeats with vigorous effort, raising <b>fresh</b> <b>money,</b> raising fresh soldiers, but not neglecting {{the good old}} method of Italian defence--conciliatory embassies. And while the scarcity of food was every day becoming greater, they had resolved, in opposition to old precedent, not to shut out the starving country people, and the mendicants driven from the gates of other cities, who came flocking to Florence like birds from a land of snow.|$|E

In all, police say Mittal had ten bank accounts in Ghaziabad.|$|R

He will go through the same business with the customs and the same business with the money. His French money is no further use to him and he must get German. A few more hours and he will arrive on the frontier of Bohemia. Same search for gold. Then customs' examination and change of money again. A few hours more and he will be in Poland. Search for gold, customs, <b>fresh</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

Subsequently, therefore, he turned to Mexico, and accepted a return to Mexican authority. Yucatán was officially reunited with Mexico on 17 August 1848.

50|$|Yucatán had {{considered}} itself an independent nation, {{but during the}} crisis of the revolt had offered sovereignty to any nation that would aid in defeating the Indians. The Mexican government was in a rare position of being cash rich from payment by the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo for the territory taken in the Mexican-American War, and accepted Yucatán's offer. Yucatán was officially reunited with Mexico on 17 August 1848.

In the 23-minute video, Cassidy revealed that Froggy Fresh was indeed a comedic character created after years of struggling to gain attention as a serious rap artist. Despite stating that he truly enjoyed the five years of making videos, Cassidy revealed that it eventually became boring for him and that the friends who populated his videos had gone in different directions in their respective lives. He also expressed his interest in becoming a comedic actor. Despite this statement, Froggy Fresh announced his first tour with the inaugural show held April 28, 2017 in Charlotte, North Carolina with DJ Justin Aswell. Subsequent shows in June 2017 took place in the Southeastern United States and featured Froggy <b>Fresh</b> alongside <b>Money</b> Maker Mike.

Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator - and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with <b>fresh</b> <b>money</b> to invest".|$|E

5000|$|Christopher Hitchens {{wrote on}} TheNation.com: The whole book is an {{exercise}} in self-love, disguised as an exercise in self-abnegation. How could he, asks the author of himself, have possibly gone on so long in telling lies, smearing reputations and inventing facts? The obvious answer—that he adored the easy money and the cheap fame that this brought him—was more than enough to still his doubts for several years. However, his publisher seems to have required a more high-toned explanation before furnishing him with a <b>fresh</b> tranche of <b>money</b> and renown. And Brock's new story—that he was taken in by a vast right-wing conspiracy—is just as much of a lie as his earlier ones.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1980s, Jordan Downs was {{probably}} most famous {{among the general}} public {{as one of the}} homes to the newly prominent street gangs: in this case, the Crip gang named after Grape Street. In 1989, claiming that HACLA had failed to improve quality of life at the project, executive director Leila Gonzalez-Correa announced plans to sell the project to a private developer at market value. The plan was intended to provide a <b>fresh</b> influx of <b>money</b> while preserving the land as low-income housing. The plan was eventually cancelled in the face of opposition from residents and the Los Angeles City Council; potential buyers also noted that the security and insurance risks associated with the project would be likely to make Jordan Downs an unprofitable investment.

5000|$|There is a {{historical}} explanation for the two Caves (Lower and Upper), currently two streets that run almost parallel filled with shops and entertainment venues [...] These originally marked the access holes dug under the wall that allowed access {{in and out of}} the citadel even with the doors closed. In the seventeenth century, merchants coming from different areas around Madrid to sell in the market stayed in inns, taverns and hostelries on these streets. Travellers and their horses stayed in facilities governed by their countrymen. These facilities grew in quality and services creating a leisure shopping framework tailored to these visitors with <b>fresh</b> <b>money</b> and little social control. Only some of these lodges and the entire orientation to leisure dining and tavern activities, among which include the Casa Lucio, La Soleá and many other traditional establishments in Madrid of maximum relevance of its kind, are still preserved.|$|E

Adam and Peter had gone and he had loved them both; he knew he would not meet their like again. Yet he had not lost them altogether.

Look at our congregation at St. Dominic's! Why do they come to hear you talking about Christianity every Sunday? Why, just because they've been so full of business and money-making for six days that they want to forget all about it and have a rest on the seventh, so that they can go back <b>fresh</b> and make <b>money</b> harder than ever!
