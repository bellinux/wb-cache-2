25|$|The {{division}} of the major psychoses into manic <b>depressive</b> <b>illness</b> (now called bipolar disorder) and dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) was made by Emil Kraepelin, who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th century psychiatrists, by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term 'manic depressive insanity' to describe the whole spectrum of mood disorders, in a far wider sense than it is usually used today.|$|E
25|$|The thirty-one {{years during}} which Huxley {{occupied}} {{the chair of}} natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life.

He resigned {{the presidency of the}} Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months' leave.

40|$|In this article, the {{contribution}} of hereditary factors in the onset of depressive diseases is analysed. Primary depressive diseases may be now separated into two groups: one includes bipolar depressive syndromes (i. e. of manic depressive type), and the other the monopolar depressive syndromes (i. e. of depressive type). A short review of twin studies and family studies in the manic depressive type bipolar <b>depressive</b> <b>illnesses</b> is made. From these studies, a discussion about genetic hypotheses concerning manic <b>depressive</b> <b>illnesses</b> and that of a dominant X-linked disease was made. Genetic factors are also reviewed {{in regard to the}} heterogeneous group of monopolar depressive diseases, emphasizing the different depressive subgroups of this large category. Finally, the authors also consider the possible relationship between bipolar manic depressive syndromes and schizophrenia, trying to classify the dysthymic schizophrenias.

In 1931, he had a nervous breakdown that was linked to difficulties in a rubber industry concern. After a second breakdown following service with the Home Guard in the Second World War, {{he became one of the}} early pioneers to undergo electro-convulsive therapy (ECT). He had by this time retired to Bicknoller in west Somerset, whose most famous resident was another Somerset cricketer, Harold Gimblett, who similarly suffered from <b>depressive</b> <b>illness</b> and underwent ECT.|$|E

He spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition. In 1973, Barnes died at his home in Collaroy, one of Sydney's northern beach suburbs, from barbiturate and bromide poisoning. Although the medications were certainly self-administered, the coroner could not [...] "determine intent".|$|E
500|$|During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier {{performed}} Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, {{and sang}} in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She {{returned to the}} Netherlands in January 1949 {{for a series of}} recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a <b>depressive</b> <b>illness</b> that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated [...] "this abominable accompanist" [...] who deserved [...] "a kick in the pants". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: [...] "What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.|$|E
40|$|This {{book will}} focus on {{intervention}} strategies for treating anxiety and depression in people with intellectual disabilities (ID). The rationale for this theme {{is the lack of}} an adequate evidence base for assessment and intervention approaches for this population. For example, although anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in the general population, very little is known about their incidence and manifestation in people with ID. Furthermore, research evidence indicates a high prevalence of depression and related illnesses in this population, and the nature and manifestation of <b>depressive</b> <b>illnesses</b> in people with ID warrant an in-depth examination to highlight the knowledge base of appropriate assessments and intervention strategies. This book explores the full range of anxiety and <b>depressive</b> <b>illnesses</b> in relation to people with ID, captures their nature and manifestation, and describes assessment and intervention approache...|$|R

In the biography, Foot writes of discovering the depth and the variety of Gimblett's different hatreds: [...] "The hate– his uncompromising word– was spread over a wide area."

Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of World War I, Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft [...] "it will not be long before those planes are flying over England". In 1913 Huxley had a nervous breakdown after the break-up of his relationship with 'K', and rested in a nursing home. His depression returned the next year, and he and his brother Trevelyan (two years his junior) ended up in the same nursing home.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to provide a contemporary review of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practice in Far North Queensland, Australia.

Results: <b>Depressive</b> <b>illnesses</b> were the most common indicator for treatment. However, psychotic illnesses also made up a large proportion of treated cases. The technical aspects of treatment were commensurate with previous Australian findings except for the higher incidence of bifrontal ECT and maintenance treatment. Conclusions: Further research is needed across Australia to determine whether the findings of the current study represent changes in Australian ECT practice...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the mental impairment (insanity) defense in the Australian state of Victoria and argues that the defense is successful only when offenders suffer from psychotic mental illnesses.
