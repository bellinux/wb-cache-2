5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain {{more than a handful}} of successes against the Gothas.|$|E

CBS dropped {{the show in}} 1964, citing Benny's lack of appeal to the younger {{demographic}} the network began courting, {{and he went to}} NBC, his original network, in the fall, only to be out-rated by CBS's Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. The network dropped Benny {{at the end of the}} season. He continued to make occasional specials into the 1970s, the last one airing in January 1974.|$|E
25|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, then-Lieutenant Arnold {{made his way}} to Pearl Harbor under fire. After quite a bit of trouble convincing the crew of a {{whaleboat}} to take him to Ford Island, his normal duty station, he <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the island. There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he fired up the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member crawled up on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, get off my wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E
25|$|Cage persuaded {{his parents}} that {{a trip to}} Europe would be more {{beneficial}} to a future writer than college studies. He subsequently hitchhiked to Galveston and sailed to Le Havre, where he took a train to Paris. Cage stayed in Europe for some 18 months, trying his hand at various forms of art. First he studied Gothic and Greek architecture, but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it. He then took up painting, poetry and music. It was in Europe that, encouraged by his teacher Lazare Lévy, he first heard the music of contemporary composers (such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith) and <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he had not experienced before.|$|E

25|$|While the 2nd New Zealand Division {{attacked}} the western slopes of Ruweisat Ridge, the Indian 5th Brigade made small gains on Ruweisat ridge to the east. By 07:00, word was <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> 2nd Armoured Brigade which {{started to move}} north west. Two regiments became embroiled in a minefield but the third was able to join Indian 5th Infantry 5th Brigade as it renewed its attack. With {{the help of the}} armour and artillery, the Indians were able to take their objectives by early afternoon. Meanwhile, the 22nd Armoured Brigade had been engaged at Alam Nayil by 90th Light Division and the Ariete Armoured Division, advancing from the south. While—with help from mobile infantry and artillery columns from 7th Armoured Division—they pushed back the Axis probe with ease, they were prevented from advancing north to protect the New Zealand flank.|$|E
25|$|The Dragons <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} a one-day league match, and also recorded their first win of the season, winning a shortened match at Trent Bridge by four runs, and following {{it up with}} a C Trophy victory over Suffolk on 4 May. That was followed up with two more Championship losses, against Gloucestershire and then Surrey, and the streak of defeats continued as eventual champions Essex beat them by five wickets in the National League. The defending champions of one-day league cricket then got knocked out of the C Trophy with a six-wicket defeat at home to Hampshire, and their fifth successive Championship loss also came at the hands of Hampshire, before they rounded off the month as it started by beating Worcestershire Royals in a day/night National League game at Sophia Gardens. They finished May bottom of the First Division of the Championship.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 One Day Cricket in England {{was given}} a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for day/night cricket in England. For the first time Day/Night matches were played in the than known C Trophy {{although}} as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl. Also 2006 saw {{the launch of the}} NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed to home and away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced because the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 but for one thing. On 10 September 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord's <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stage its first game under floodlights with a match between Middlesex and Derbyshire, a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals bullpen faced {{another long}} outing. They {{stretched}} their streak of scoreless innings {{in the series}} to 14⅓, but with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the fifth inning, Reynaldo López became the first Washington reliever to give up a run in the series when Reddick singled and Pederson drove him in with an RBI double, giving Los Angeles a 5-2 lead. The Nationals′ offense, meanwhile, <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Kershaw, staging a comeback in the top of the seventh inning. Shortstop Danny Espinosa, who had gone 0-for-10 with nine strikeouts in the series, singled for his first hit of the 2016 postseason. He was still on first with two outs when Trea Turner singled and Harper walked to load the bases, driving Kershaw out of the game after throwing 110 pitches. Dodgers reliever Pedro Baez then hit Werth with a pitch to force Espinosa home, and Los Angeles reliever Luis Avilán gave up a single to Murphy that scored Turner and Harper, tying the game at 5-5, with all five Nationals runs charged to Kershaw. Kershaw′s day ended with a 6.17 ERA in his two outings against the Nats.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there was}} general {{agreement}} that property {{law should be}} reformed the process was made more difficult by the various vested interests involved; the Law Society, for example, was opposed to the changes because it would reduce the fees dedicated property solicitors could earn by {{making it possible for}} more solicitors to understand that area of law and become involved. After intense negotiation Schuster and the Law Society representative agreed that a [...] "period of probation" [...] lasting three years would be included in the bill, which Charles Brickdale the Chief Registrar of HM Land Registry considered [...] "a very good bargain". When the bill <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the House of Commons it met additional opposition from Members of Parliament who were also members of the Law Society and Bar Council, as well as Lord Cave who later became Lord Chancellor. After further negotiations the bill was passed on 8 June 1922, with Birkenhead taking the credit, and it became the Law of Property Act 1922.|$|E
500|$|Because fevers and colitis {{were still}} a problem, Javsicas {{performed}} ultrasound and found a problem area in his colon, thus surgery was required.

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it."

500|$|In January 1930, Hergé {{introduced}} Quick & Flupke (Quick et Flupke), a new {{comic strip}} about two street kids from Brussels, {{in the pages}} of Le Petit Vingtième. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, {{at the time it was}} un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales. For the third adventure, Tintin in America, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology. Although the Adventures of Tintin had been serialised in the French Catholic Cœurs Vaillants ("Brave Hearts") since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too. Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed [...] "conservative young man" [...] dedicated to his work.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On {{television}} broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what they were going to do at Wembley, and when they <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours.
