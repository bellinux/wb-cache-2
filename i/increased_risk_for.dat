5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been established that the ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions and neurites observed in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) contain the TAR DNA-binding protein, TDP- 43. It {{is not uncommon for}} genetic variation of genes that encode proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative conditions to <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> disease. We therefore examined whether variation of the TDP- 43 locus was associated with an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of disease in the Manchester FTLD cohort. We found no evidence of TDP- 43 variation <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> FTLD in this cohort. These data suggest that TDP- 43 accumulation is a consequence of the disease process underlying FTLD...|$|R

5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|M. A. The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{is a major}} nemesis in South Africa. The rates of infection among adolescents is increasing {{at an alarming rate}} and one of the key factors identified as <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection is substance abuse. This paper is aimed at reviewing studies that have been conducted on international and national levels, regarding the theories and factors that <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> substance abuse and HIV infection. Although the review by Parry et al (2002) documents the incidence and trends of substance abuse in South Africa, this paper was predominantly quantitative in nature and is indicative of the dire need for intervention and prevention strategies. A qualitative analysis however would guide prevention and intervention programs. Thus it is imperative to explore those factors that <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> substance abuse and HIV infection among adolescents. Moving beyond this there is even greater need to investigate these factors among Black adolescents since Rocha- Silva (1998) has reported that heavy drug use has spread to poor, rural, disadvantaged communities and most local studies have focused on White adolescents...|$|R
