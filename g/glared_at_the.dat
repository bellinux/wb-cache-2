2500|$|In 208, {{following}} Liu Biao's death, Cao Cao {{started a}} campaign aimed at wiping out opposing forces in southern China. When his armies arrived in Jing Province, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, Liu Cong, surrendered to Cao Cao. Liu Bei evacuated Xinye County and headed south with his followers towards Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which {{was controlled by}} Liu Biao's elder son, Liu Qi. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei, and they {{caught up with him}} at Changban (長阪), Dangyang (當陽). Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, with only Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and a small number of soldiers accompanying him. Zhang Fei led 20 horsemen to cover Liu Bei's retreat. After having a bridge destroyed, he stood guard at one end (facing the enemy), brandished his spear, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> enemy, and shouted, [...] "I'm Zhang Yide. You can come forth and fight me to the death!" [...] Cao Cao's soldiers were all afraid and did not dare to approach him. Liu Bei and his followers were hence able to retreat safely.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{too much}} to hope for that Alec Bedser would dismiss Arthur Morris cheaply {{for the third time in}} a row, but he did in his second over and the Australian vice-captain was taken by Len Hutton in the slips for 2. Neil Harvey (42) came in at 6/1 and Australia were 67/1 at lunch despite the bowling of Bedser (who bowled {{unchanged}} throughout the morning) and Bailey and surprisingly good English fielding. Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball was constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that Godfrey Evans snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto Ken Archer (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and Australia were 89/3. Keith Miller, whose matinée idol looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by Cyril Washbrook in the covers and Reg Simpson on the boundary-fence and he was trapped lbw by Freddie Brown (1/28) to bring Australia down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day. Lindsay Hassett played a careful captain's innings of 52, adding 84 in an hour and a half with Sam Loxton (32). Brian Close was a short-leg to Hassett and kept on edging closer until he was almost face-to-face. He was brought on to rest Bedser and Bailey before the new ball was taken and Loxton was given [...] "not out" [...] when he appeared to give Hutton a straightforward catch in the gully. Soon after Loxton was out to a catch by Evans off Close when he didn't make contact and he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> umpire; [...] "Tha' were lucky once, Sam" [...] said Hutton [...] "so don't grouse" [...] and Australia were 177/5, which soon became 177/6 when Bedser yorked Hassett while loosening up with the old ball. The new ball was taken and Bedser (4/37) and Bailey (4/40) promptly cleared up the tail for 17 runs and Australia were all out for 194 at stumps.|$|E
