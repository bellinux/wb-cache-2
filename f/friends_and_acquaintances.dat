At the time, Croly was writing his influential book The Promise of American Life, in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances,</b> including former president Theodore Roosevelt. Croly's ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt's politics, influencing his advocacy of New Nationalism {{and the development of}} Progressivism.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P.

The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that {{it would be difficult to}} get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances.</b> Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E

The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E

He ceased to be lonely, making a number of <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances,</b> principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E

5|$|Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, {{which he}} entered {{before he was}} six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his {{occasional}} long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances</b> in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually {{all of which are}} for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op.35) and all the minor keys (Op.39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits of his <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances,</b> he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 {{of which were}} shown during his lifetime. Portraiture {{was seen as a}} vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E

Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintances</b> to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E

This study is a survey, studied population {{of which is the}} shareholders of Tehran stock market; 384 people had been selected randomly and had been questioned. We had analyzed the result using variance analysis method. The findings show that, there are some social networks which effect participating of shareholders in stock market including: social networks of <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintance,</b> social network of relatives and kinsfolk, social network of Internet, social group of ethnicity. They had the strongest effect. The strongest networks which affect decision-making about selling and buying the shares are, respectively: social network of coworkers in stock market, social network of <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>acquaintance,</b> social network of relatives and kinsfolk. We concluded that social and economic policy-makers in course of stock market expansion, can support the effective social networks of stock market and equip them with information, or, establish (virtual informative) networks in stock market...|$|R
