5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, <b>discussions</b> <b>and</b> designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

Limousins when they reach 15/16 Limousin content.

5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop.

After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E

While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with <b>discussions</b> <b>and</b> publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E

Smallpeice initially attempted to resolve the financial position of the company by embarking on a merger with another shipping line. Ocean Steamship Company had previously asked that they have first refusal on a merger with Cunard. Ocean Steamship brought P into the <b>discussions,</b> <b>and</b> a three-way merger at one point looked feasible, but neither party could see any benefit in a deal involving Cunard, and backed out of proposed deal.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to move them to French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to move them to the USA where they would be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of <b>discussions</b> <b>and</b> the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E

To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year.

The Catholic students had regular prayers. Although the college did not require students to be Catholic, Soegija was pressured by his Catholic classmates, leading to several fights. Feeling dissatisfied, Soegija complained to his teacher that the Dutch priests were like merchants, thinking only of money. The priest replied that the teachers were unpaid and only hoped for the students' good. This led Soegija to better respect the priests, and when van Rijckevorsel told the other students that Soegija {{did not want to be}} Catholic, they stopped pressuring him.|$|E
