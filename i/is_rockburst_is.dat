40|$|<b>Rockburst</b> <b>is</b> {{a kind of}} {{artificial}} earthquake induced by human activities, such as mining excavations. The mechanism of rockburst induced by mining disturbance is revealed in terms of energy in this context. For understanding the rockburst mechanism, two necessary conditions for the occurrence of <b>rockburst</b> <b>are</b> presented: (1) the rock mass has the capability to store huge amount of energy and possesses a strong bumping-prone characteristic when damaged; and (2) the geological conditions in the mining area have favorable geo-stress environments that can form high-stress concentration area and accumulate huge energy.

(2) The critical overburden depth of rockburst in the transportation tunnel is 600 m, and the length of the continuous occurrence section of <b>rockburst</b> <b>is</b> smaller than 25 m. The damaged depth of the rockburst has the tendency to increase with the increasing overburden depth, and the maximum damaged depth is over 3. 5 m. (3) From east to west (west to east) in Jinping II hydropower station, the rockburst usually takes place in the right (left) side of tunnel working face, and then the left (right) or roof of the tunnel.

40|$|Stability of {{underground}} excavations {{is a prerequisite}} for the proper functioning of all other systems in a mining environment. From a safety point of view, the lives of people working underground rely on how well the support systems installed underground are performing. The ground control engineer cannot design an effective support system unless the area of the rock mass around the opening, prone to failure, is well identified in advance, even before the excavation of the tunnel. Under high stress conditions, usually experienced at deep mining levels, stress-induced rock failure is {{the most common type of}} instability around the underground openings. This thesis focuses firstly on the use of the finite difference numerical tool FLAC to simulate brittle rock failure under static in-situ stresses. Brittle failure of the rock mass around underground openings is a particular type of stress-induced failure, which can result in notch-shaped breakouts around the boundary of the tunnel. Generation of these breakout zones is a discontinuum process and approximating this process using FLAC, which is a continuum tool, requires careful consideration of the stress conditions and the stress related behavior of rock material. Based on plasticity theory, this thesis makes an effort to estimate the breakout formation using an elastic – brittle - plastic material model. Due to seismic challenges that deep mining operations <b>are</b> currently experiencing, <b>rockbursting</b> <b>is</b> a major hazard to the stability {{of underground}} structures. Therefore in this research, brittle failure of rock in the vicinity of the underground excavations is approximated also under dynamic loading conditions. The numerically modeled results of two different material models iv are compared with each other along with a previously developed empirical graph.

40|$|Rockbursts {{may cause}} damages to {{underground}} openings and to equipment, and constitute a major hazard {{to the safety}} of mine workers. One method {{that can be used to}} evaluate if there <b>is</b> a <b>rockburst</b> potential <b>is</b> to compare the stiffness of the failed rock with that of the surrounding rock mass. This method has been applied successfully in the past to rockbursts involving fracturing of the rock mass. This thesis deals with the development of a similar approach for rockbursts involving a violent slip along major geological discontinuities. To evaluate the post-peak shear stiffness of a discontinuity, a new non-linear constitutive model for rock joint was developed. This model is based on two exponential formulations expressing the two phenomena taking part in the shearing process: friction resistance along surfaces and shearing of asperities. Compared with test results, the model showed a correlation factor (R 2) of 0. 90. The model was then implemented in an existing boundary element code to evaluate the interaction between underground openings and nearby geological discontinuities. Verification of the implementation was done by reproducing direct shear tests on a discontinuity. Parametric analyses were performed on the new model that highlighted the most important parameters. Methods to obtain the different stiffnesses involved in the violent slip process were developed. Examples of applications were given to illustrate the proposed methods. Finally, an alternative method to evaluate the fault-slip <b>rockburst</b> potential <b>was</b> developed. This new method relies on a linear analysis and the calculation of a new index called the Out-of-Balance Index or OBI. The OBI showed some agreement with the stiffness approach...|$|R

Based on theoretical analysis, laboratory experiment, numerical simulation and field test, the characteristics of coal bumps occurrence in China's coal mines were described, and the difference between coal bumps and <b>rockbursts</b> <b>was</b> also discussed. In addition, three categories of coal bumps induced by “material failure” were introduced, i. e. hard roof, floor strata and tectonic structures, in which the mechanism of coal bumps induced by geological structures was analyzed. This involves the bump liability and microstructure effects on bump-prone coal failure, the mechanism of coal bumps in response to fault reactivation, island face mining or hard roof failure. Next, the achievements in the monitoring and controlling methods of coal bumps were reviewed. These methods involve the incorporated prediction system of micro-seismicity and mining-induced pressure, the distributed micro-seismic monitoring system, energy absorption support system, bolts with constant resistance and large elongation, and the “multi-stage” high-performance support. Finally, an optimal mining design is desirable for the purpose of coal bump mitigation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNumerical {{analysis}} of the total energy release of surrounding rocks excavated by drill-and-blast (D&B) method and tunnel boring machine (TBM) method {{is presented in the}} paper. The stability of deep tunnels during excavation in terms of energy release is also discussed. The simulation results reveal that energy release during blasting excavation is a dynamic process. An intense dynamic effect is captured at large excavation footage. The magnitude of energy release during full-face excavation with D&B method is higher than that with TBM method under the same conditions. The energy release rate (ERR) and speed (ERS) also have similar trends. Therefore, the rockbursts in tunnels excavated by D&B method are frequently encountered and more intensive than those by TBM method. Since the space after tunnel face is occupied by the backup system of TBM, prevention and control of <b>rockbursts</b> <b>are</b> more difficult. Thus, <b>rockbursts</b> in tunnels excavated by TBM method with the same intensity are more harmful than those in tunnels by D&B method. Reducing tunneling rate of TBM seems to be a good means to decrease ERR and risk of rockburst. The rockbursts observed during excavation of headrace tunnels at Jinping II hydropower station in West China confirm the analytical results obtained in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImpact {{rockburst}} test on sandstone samples with {{a central}} hole is carried out under true triaxial static loads and vertical dynamic load conditions, and rock fragments after the test are collected. The fragments of sandstone generated from strain rockburst test and uniaxial compression test are also collected. The fragments are weighed and the length, width and thickness of each piece of fragments are measured respectively. The fragment quantities with coarse, medium, fine and micro grains in different size ranges, mass and particles distributions are also analyzed. Then, the fractal dimension of fragments is calculated by the methods of size-frequency, mass-frequency and length-to-thickness ratio-frequency. It is found that the crushing degree of impact <b>rockburst</b> fragments <b>is</b> higher, accompanied with blocky characteristics observably. The mass percentage of small grains, including fine and micro grains, in impact <b>rockburst</b> test <b>is</b> higher than those in strain rockburst test and uniaxial compression test. Energy dissipation from <b>rockburst</b> tests <b>is</b> more than that from uniaxial compression test, as the quantity of micro grains generated does...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental study}} on rockbursts {{that occur in}} deep underground excavations. To begin with, the boundary conditions for excavation in deep underground engineering were analysed and elastic adaptive boundary is {{an effective way to}} minimize the boundary effect of geomechanical model test. Then, in order to simulate an elastic adaptive loading boundary, Belleville springs were used to establish this loading boundary. With the aforementioned experimental set-ups and fabrication of similarity models for test, the phenomena of strain mode <b>rockbursts</b> <b>were</b> satisfactorily reproduced in laboratory. The internal stress, strain, and convergences of the openings of the model were instrumented by subtly preembedded sensors and transducers. Test results showed that, with an initial state of high stress from both upper layers’ gravitational effects and in situ stress due to tectonic movements, the excavation brings a dramatic rise in the hoop stress and sharp drop in radial stress, which leads to the splitting failure of rock mass. Finally a rockburst occurred associated with the release of strain energy stored in highly stressed rock mass. In addition, the failure of the surrounding rock demonstrated an obvious hysteresis effect which supplies valuable guide and reference for tunnel support. Not only do these results provide a basis for further comprehensive experiments, but also the data can offer assisting aids for further theoretical study of rockbursts...|$|R
40|$|The {{depth of}} mining {{in the gold}} mines of the Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa is {{continuously}} increasing, with several mines already stoping at depths exceeding 3500 m. Due to the high stresses imposed on the rock mass in these deep level mines, a high potential for rockbursts exists. Rockbursts cause injuries and deaths to the workers and lost production time. One of the techniques for reducing the severity of damage of face-bursts (a class of rockbursts where the mining face is ejected into the excavation) is preconditioning. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is used to quantify the change in fracture pattern with preconditioning. It is found that both the intensity and depth to which fracturing occurs ahead of the mining face increased, thereby delineating the area of influence of the preconditioning blast. This allowed {{the establishment of the}} optimum preconditioning methodology. To further enhance the understanding of the controlling factors involved, a <b>rockburst</b> <b>was</b> simulated in the tunnel sidewall of a crosscut in a deep level mine. GPR is again used to depict the fracture pattern before and after the synthetic rockburst. The radar scans show a new set of blast-hole parallel fractures, whilst nearer the sidewall, dilation and a slight increase in length of pre-existing fractures occurred. In both cases it is shown that GPR represents a useful tool for rock mechanics practitioners in defining the most suitabl...|$|R
