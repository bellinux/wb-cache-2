5|$|Paxata is {{a privately}} owned {{software}} company headquartered in Redwood City, California.

It is used to combine <b>data</b> from different sources, then check it for <b>data</b> quality issues, such as duplicates and outliers. Algorithms and machine learning automate certain aspects of <b>data</b> preparation and users work with the software through a user-interface similar to Excel spreadsheets.|$|E

5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic <b>data</b> to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with <b>data</b> which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic <b>data)</b> from the LBAs with <b>data</b> which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static <b>data).</b> If the <b>data</b> is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic <b>data</b> (which caused the rewrite initially) and static <b>data</b> (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of <b>data</b> that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the <b>data</b> will enable static <b>data</b> to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that <b>data.</b> The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static <b>data</b> because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
5|$|Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, {{audio and}} auxiliary <b>data</b> using three different packet types, called the Video <b>Data</b> Period, the <b>Data</b> Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video <b>Data</b> Period, the pixels {{of an active}} video line are transmitted. During the <b>Data</b> Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary <b>data</b> are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and <b>Data</b> Island periods.|$|E

25|$|<b>Data</b> mining {{requires}} <b>data</b> preparation {{which can}} uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through <b>data</b> aggregation. <b>Data</b> aggregation involves combining <b>data</b> together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level <b>data</b> deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not <b>data</b> mining per se, but a result of the preparation of <b>data</b> before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the <b>data,</b> once compiled, cause the <b>data</b> miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled <b>data</b> set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the <b>data</b> were originally anonymous.|$|E

25|$|Before <b>data</b> mining {{algorithms}} can be used, {{a target}} <b>data</b> set must be assembled.

A common source for <b>data</b> is a <b>data</b> mart or <b>data</b> warehouse. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the multivariate <b>data</b> sets before <b>data</b> mining. The target set is then cleaned. <b>Data</b> cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing <b>data.</b>|$|E

25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definitions}} above, if one already has price and quantity <b>data</b> (or, alternatively, price and expenditure <b>data)</b> for the base period, then calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period requires only new price <b>data.</b> In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) for a new period requires both new price <b>data</b> and new quantity <b>data</b> (or, alternatively, both new price <b>data</b> and new expenditure <b>data)</b> for each new period. Collecting only new price <b>data</b> is often easier than collecting both new price <b>data</b> and new quantity <b>data,</b> so calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices for a new period.|$|E
