40|$|The {{effect of}} various factors upon the {{hemolytic}} action of lysolecithin with washed rabbit erythrocytes {{is described in}} this paper. Wilbur and Collier (1943) used a photoelectric method to investigate the hemolytic action of lysolecithin; and the present investigation {{is a continuation of}} their work, with improved methods. The term "lysolecithin " has been used to describe the hemolytic substance formed by the action of snake venoms on egg yolk; but as pointed out by Levene, Rolf, and Simms (1924) the product contains a small proportion of lysocephalin as well as lysolecithin. Throughout the present paper the abbreviation LL will be used to designate this mixture of lysolipids. Methods Lysolipid was prepared by the action of rattlesnake venom upon egg yolk, according to the method of <b>King</b> and <b>Dolan</b> (1933). The reprecipitated and dried product had a total phosphorus content of 5. 16 per cent, as compared with the range of 5. 19 to 5. 72 per cent found by <b>King</b> and <b>Dolan</b> in their various fractious.

40|$|T N SPITE of {{the fact}} that micromethods for •* • {{quantitative}} determination of silica in or-ganic material have been available for twen-ty years, no data {{have been reported in the}} literature concerning the silica content-of human blood in individuals of various ages. The results of analyses of protein-free fil-trates of whole blood from five normal sub-jects have been reported by <b>King</b> and <b>Dolan</b> (2), who found an average silica (Si O 2) concentration of 0. 80 mg. per cent. In a later publication (1) King reports lower values, however, the silica concentration in a short series of analyses ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 63 mg. per cent. These latter samples wer...|$|R
50|$|A Distant Shore: African Americans of D-Day is a {{television}} documentary {{program that was}} produced for The History Channel by Flight 33 Productions in 2007.

40|$|SecA {{is found}} in Escherichia coli both tightly {{associated}} with the cytoplasmic membrane where it functions as a translocation ATPase during protein export and free in the cytosol (R. J. Cabelli, <b>K.</b> M. <b>Dolan,</b> L. Qian, and D. B. Oliver, J. Biol. Chem. 266 : 24420 - 24427, 1991; D. B. Oliver and J. Beckwith, Cell 30 : 311 - 319, 1982; W. Wickner, A. J. M. Driessen, and F. -U. Hartl, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 60 : 101 - 124, 1991). Here we show that SecA can be immunoprecipitated from the cytosol in complex with both fully elongated and nascent species of the precursor of maltose-binding protein, an exported, periplasmic protein. In addition, under conditions in which the distribution of SecA between the cytosolic and membrane-bound states changes from that normally observed, the distribution of precursor maltose-binding protein changes in parallel. These results {{support the idea that}} cytosolic SecA plays a role in export. With the aim of determining the roles of the multiple binding sites for ATP on SecA, we compared the export defect in a culture of E. coli expressing a temperature-sensitive allele of secA with the defect in a culture treated with sodium azide. The results indicate that the mutational change and treatment with sodium azide inhibit export by affecting different steps in the cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis by SecA...|$|R
50|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 1971 primaries, Dolan {{continued}} as director for Committee on Natural Resources {{until his retirement in}} the late 1970s. Dolan spent the remainder of his life in Ipswich, digging clams and enjoying time with his grandchildren and a great-grandson who was named in his honor. Dolan also wrote a series of historical articles for the Ipswich Chronicle in the 1990s. One of his grandsons is Samuel <b>K.</b> <b>Dolan,</b> an Emmy Award winning documentary producer with Flight 33 Productions. John F.

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2011, the National Geographic Channel aired a 1-hour pilot episode for a new {{documentary}} series called [...] "Navajo Cops". The program was developed by Flight 33 Productions & was written & produced by Samuel <b>K.</b> <b>Dolan</b> (who pitched the concept). The pilot, which followed the officers of the Navajo Nation Police and the Navajo Rangers was filmed in 2010 and premiered on Wednesday, May 11, 2011 to positive ratings. In the Summer of 2011 {{it was announced that}} the series had been picked up for 6 additional episodes. The series, which highlights the hard work and daily sacrifices of the men & women of the Navajo Nation Police Department, premiered in March of 2012. It was filmed primarily in the Window Rock, Chinle, Kayenta and Tuba City Police Districts, with some segments also filmed in Shiprock & Crownpoint, New Mexico. Louis Tarantino and Douglas Cohen are the Executive Producers (for Flight 33 Productions) & Tim Evans served as Supervising Producer, while Dolan served as Senior Producer and also directed several episodes. The series was written by Dolan and Steffen Schlachtenhaufen.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), {{individuals}} are typically considered {{by the general public}} to be asexual. Handicapped women have more problems with socio-sexual adaptation, stemming from low self-confidence, low self-esteem, and the absence of spontaneity. Aims: To determine changes in the sexual lives of women after SCI. Methods: A self-constructed questionnaire was used to map sexual function after SCI. We retrospectively compared sexual function in 30 women with SCI with that in 30 without SCI who led an active sexual life. Descriptive and inductive statistics were applied using the Student paired and non-paired t-tests and the Levene test. Main Outcome Measures: The main variables were presence vs absence of sexual dysfunction in a group of women after SCI and a comparison of the incidence of sexual dysfunctions in women after SCI with that of a control group. Results: A significant difference was ascertained in women with SCI in sexual desire (P <. 001), lubrication (P <. 001), and reaching orgasm before and after injury (P =. 030). A comparison of the two groups showed {{a significant difference in the}} realization of coital sexual activity (P <. 001), erotogenous zones of the mouth (P = . 016), nipples (P =. 022), and genitals (P <. 001), and in the ability to reach orgasm (P =. 033). The negative impact of incontinence on the sexual life of women with SCI proved significant (P <. 001). Negative factors for sexual activity in women with SCI were lower sensitivity in 16 (53 %), spasms and mobility problems in 12 (40 %), lower desire in 11 (36 %), pain in 4 (13 %), and a less accommodating partner in 3 (10 %). Conclusion: Intercourse was the preferred sexual activity in women with SCI. Compared with the period before injury, there was significant lowering of sexual desire, impaired lubrication, and orgasmic ability after SCI. A comparison of the two groups showed a difference in erotogenous zones and in reaching orgasm. Sramkova T, Skrivanova <b>K,</b> <b>Dolan</b> I, et al. Women's Sex Life After Spinal Cord Injury.
