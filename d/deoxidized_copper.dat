40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the causes}} of the early corrosion failure of phosphorus <b>deoxidized</b> <b>copper</b> tubes which formed part of an air-conditioning unit. The failure of the tubes occurred after 2 - 3 months service time. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques were used. Corrosion tests were also performed at the laboratory using three types of uncorroded copper tubes, 40, 80 and 100 % relative humidities, 20 and 40 °C temperature, and two commercial lubricant oils. Organic acids, chloride and sulphur were found as sources of corrosion failure. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH,. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{discusses}} {{laser cutting}} of non-ferrous metals using fiber YbYag laser {{and evaluation of}} the roughness of cutting edge samples. To manufacture samples of aluminium Al 99, 5, <b>deoxidized</b> <b>copper</b> Cu – DHP and brass CuZn 37 were used combinations of process parameters according to Taguchi statistical method. Samples were subsequently evaluated, according to the ČSN EN ISO 9013 standard and sorted into roughness cathegories, and by technical and economical evaluation, the most economical process parameter combinations were found. Experimantal part is preceded by description of general methods of cutting, description of laser types, process parameters and their influence on the occurrence of the cutting edge defects and description of roughness measurement and standard ČSN EN ISO 9013...|$|E
50|$|High {{electrical}} conductivity coppers are distinct from <b>coppers</b> <b>deoxidized</b> {{by the addition}} of phosphorus in the smelting process. Oxygen-free phosphorus-containing copper (CuOFP) is typically used for structural and thermal applications where the copper material will be subject to temperatures high enough to cause hydrogen embrittlement or more exactly steam embrittlement. Examples include welding/brazing rods and heat exchanger tubing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{difference}} in annealing characteristics of oxygen free <b>copper</b> (OFC) and <b>deoxidized</b> low-phosphorous <b>copper</b> (DLP) processed by ARB was studied. The copper alloys processed by eight cycles of the ARB were annealed for 10 minutes at various temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 °C. The variation of microstructure and mechanical properties with annealing was significantly different in both copper alloys. In case of OFC, the ultrafine grained (UFG) structure {{formed by the}} ARB still remained up to 200 °C, and above 200 °C it was completely replaced with a coarse grained structure due to an occurrence of the conventional recrystallization. However, in case of DLP, the recrystallization did not occur even at 350 °C. The strength of the OFC also decreased significantly at annealing temperatures above 200 °C, while the hardness of the DLP did not decrease so largely up to 350 °C. These differences in annealing characteristics in both copper alloys were {{discussed in terms of}} purity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to assess the effect of phosphorus addition on copper- tin alloys. However, the effect {{of an increase in}} phosphorus above 0. 25 % has received little or no attention. Much effort has been expended only to study the effect of phosphorus as a <b>deoxidizing</b> agent on <b>copper</b> and its alloys. In this study, a new approach of casting phosphorus tin-bronze using an improvised vacuum crucible pots, made of clay mould was adopted. This method offers low cost and consumes less energy. The various microstructures that result from the slow cooling rate during the casting process enhance mechanical properties and were carefully examined. It was observed that the hardness and tensile strength increases as phosphorous content is increased from 0. 1 % to 1. 0 %. An optimum value of 0. 9 % phosphorus was obtained with corresponding hardness and tensile strength of 140 HB and 912. 26 MPa respectively...|$|R
40|$|Kuparin ja kupariseosten hitsaus eroaa merkittävästi esimerkiksi terästen hitsauksesta. Suuri lämmönjohtavuus, lämpölaajeneminen, pehmeneminen ja kuparin taipumus liuottaa kaasuja sulaan asettavat hitsaukselle haasteita. Kuparia on perinteisesti hitsattu kaasuhitsaamalla ja kaasukaarihitsausprosesseilla, mutta uudemmat menetelmät kuten laserhitsaus, elektronisuihkuhitsaus ja FSW-hitsaus tarjoavat uudenlaisia käyttökohteita korkealla laadulla. ISO 3834 - 2 asettaa noudatettavat vaatimukset hitsaustoiminnalle laatuvaatimusten ollessa kattavia. Ydinvoimalaitoksella hitsauksessa tulee lisäksi noudattaa Säteilyturvakeskuksen YVL-ohjeita, joissa on määritetty lisävaatimuksia liitosten materiaalivalinnoille, pätevöittämiselle ja tarkastamiselle. Tässä työssä tutkittiin kuparimetallien hitsauksen mahdollisuutta Loviisan ydinvoimalaitoksella juottamisen sijasta siten, että kattavat laatuvaatimukset täyttyisivät. Hitsauskokeissa ja laboratoriotutkimuksissa testattiin hitsausta erilaisilla hitsausaineilla ja hitsausprosesseilla. Koetulosten pohjalta toteutettiin hitsausmenetelmä deoksidoidun kupariputken ja tinapronssilaipan TIG-hitsaukselle. Welding {{of copper}} and copper alloys is {{significantly}} different from, for example, welding of steel. High thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, softening and copper's tendency to dissolve {{gases in the}} molten weld set challenges for welding. Copper has traditionally been welded using gas welding and {{gas shielded arc welding}} processes but newer methods, such as laser welding, electron beam welding and FSW welding, offer a new range of applications with high quality. ISO 3834 - 2 sets requirements to be complied during welding operations when quality requirements are comprehensive. In nuclear power plants, welding must also comply with the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority's YVL guides which set additional requirements for material choices, qualification and testing. In this thesis, the possibility of welding of copper and copper alloys with comprehensive quality requirements instead of brazing in Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant is examined. In welding experiments and laboratory studies, welding with different welding materials and welding processes were tested. On the basis of the test results, a welding procedure was carried out for TIG welding of <b>deoxidized</b> <b>copper</b> pipe and tin bronze flange...|$|E
