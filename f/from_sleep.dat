5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> deprivation.|$|E
5|$|When {{suffering}} <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> deprivation, active immunizations {{may have}} a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him <b>from</b> <b>sleep.</b> Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

25|$|Animals that {{hibernate}} {{are in a}} {{state of}} torpor, differing <b>from</b> <b>sleep.</b> Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it. Some hibernating animals end their hibernation a couple of times during the winter so that they can sleep. Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.|$|E

His mother, however, tells him that the children are not his, a malicious lie that she tries to corroborate by bribing a male kitchen servant to enter the empress's bed while she is asleep. Octavian is taken to the room, sees the boy, kills him at once and holds his severed head in stark accusation before his terrified wife as she wakes <b>from</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} and signs that suggest {{a rise in}} ICP including headache, vomiting without nausea, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. The headache is classically a morning headache which may wake them <b>from</b> <b>sleep.</b> The brain is relatively poorly supplied by oxygen {{as a result of}} mild hypoventilation during the sleeping hours, and also cerebral edema may worsen during the night due to the lying position. The headache is worse on coughing / sneezing / bending, and progressively worsens over time. There may also be personality or behavioral changes.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to {{how difficult it}} is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking <b>from</b> <b>sleep.</b> A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{experience}} episodes of OSA {{for only a}} short period. This can {{be the result of}} an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe infectious mononucleosis. Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of bruxism: one occurs during sleep (sleep bruxism) and one during {{wakefulness}} (awake bruxism). Dental damage may be similar in both types, but the symptoms of sleep bruxism tend to be worse on waking and improve {{during the course of}} the day, and the symptoms of awake bruxism may not be present at all on waking, and then worsen over the day. The causes of bruxism are not completely understood, but probably involve multiple factors. Awake bruxism is thought to have different causes <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> bruxism, and is more common in females, whereas males and females are affected in equal proportions by sleep bruxism. Several treatments are in use, although there is little evidence of robust efficacy for any particular treatment.|$|E

25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E
25|$|When {{melatonin}} receptor agonists activate their receptors {{it causes}} numerous physiological processes. MT1 and MT2 receptors {{may be a}} target {{for the treatment of}} circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. The SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging <b>from</b> <b>sleep</b> to immune functions. Melatonin receptors have been identified in the cardiovascular system. Evidence from animal studies points to a dual role of melatonin in the vasculature. Activation of MT1 receptors mediates vasoconstriction and the activation of MT2 receptors mediates vasodilation. Melatonin is involved in regulating immune responses in both human and animals through activation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors. MT1 and MT2 receptors are widespread in the eye and are involved in regulating aqueous humor secretion, which is important for glaucoma, and in phototransduction. This is not a complete list since many of the possible processes need further confirmation.|$|E
25|$|After {{his arrival}} at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish {{officers}} in his force assassinated {{him on the}} night of February 25. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter Butler and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers Adam Trczka, Vilém Kinsky, Christian Illov and Henry Neumann while the latter attended a feast at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers. A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of Gordon), and kicked open the bedroom door. Devereux then ran his halberd through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused <b>from</b> <b>sleep,</b> is said to have asked in vain for quarter.|$|E
