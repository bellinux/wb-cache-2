5|$|Before talks could begin, Coalition armies {{crossed the}} Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to {{celebrate}} Christmas with his wife's family before travelling {{to the new}} Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly {{over the fate of}} France intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January. Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; fortunately, he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich's other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon, as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau. This relieved Metternich's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.|$|E
5|$|In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller {{was awarded}} {{the man of the}} match after earning two {{penalties}} which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig. It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game {{in the early stages of}} the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal. Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award. On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0) and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt. Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory. On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg. On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards.

Müller said that although he was dissatisfied <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at Bayern.

500|$|At {{the time}} of filming [...] "The Five", the actors who played Watson and Griffin had not been cast yet. The {{producers}} would later cast Peter Wingfield as Watson.

[...] At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Division I Championship, he helped France to a third-place finish, the first time the French under-18 team had ever won a medal in an IIHF tournament.

Palacios lost the election, so Pablo had to remain with Atlético. His agent spoke out in his defence, confirming that Pablo had not asked to leave Atlético, and the Palacios faction were {{taking advantage of a}} contractual clause allowing him to leave if an offer of €15m were received (the club claimed the figure was only a basis for negotiation). He also disingenuously suggested that joining the hated rival was no different from joining a big club abroad. Atlético coach Javier Aguirre made it clear they still wanted and needed [...] "the best centre-back in Spain", and the player apologised to the fans, insisting <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at Atlético and admitting he had made a mistake in accepting Real's offer.|$|E
500|$|He {{played for}} only 32 minutes against Groningen, after a display which lacked creativity. He said {{afterwards}} {{he was tired}} and was carrying a slight injury during the match, but Koeman criticised Mido saying he was not giving everything. He revealed in September 2002 {{that he wanted to}} leave Ajax in the transfer window in late December. However, Mido soon apologised to Koeman and Leo Beenhakker regarding the transfer comments, saying he was [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "unthoughtful". He was handed a fine and suspended from Ajax's game against Olympique Lyonnais. In December of that year, he revealed that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at Ajax. He scored for Ajax during their 6–0 defeat of Willem II in February 2003, but Koeman again criticised Mido, commenting negatively on his performance against Roda in the KNVB Cup. He was dropped for Ajax's next game against Feyenoord, only featuring as an unused substitute. He suffered a muscle strain in his upper thigh after a friendly for Egypt, and was ruled out of Ajax's game against Groningen. Mido was relegated to the Ajax reserve team for disciplinary reasons, surrounding a perceived lack of effort in training. His situation at the club led to interest from Serie A clubs Juventus and Lazio and he later admitted to have thrown a pair of scissors at Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović following an argument in March 2003.|$|E
500|$|Middleton was {{the only}} {{commander}} that VIII Corps had ever had in combat. [...] He had been {{away from home for}} over 1200 days since departing in January 1942, and had logged 480 days in combat, more time than any other American general officer during World War II. [...] Near the end of May 1945 groups of general officers, other officers and enlisted men were sent to several major cities across the United States to appear in parades. Middleton was part of a group headed by Courtney Hodges that went to Atlanta, where he and his son reunited with his wife and daughter (his son, Lieutenant Troy Middleton Jr. had been with him in Europe) and where they were treated to a reception held by the mayor. [...] From Atlanta the family flew to Baton Rouge where Middleton took 15 days of leave, after which he went to Washington D.C. to meet with General Marshall. [...] Marshall told Middleton that he could either return to Germany to be with his corps, or he could wait at home until the unit returned to the states, Middleton opting for the latter. Marshall also told Middleton that VIII Corps was being ticketed for Japan. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Middleton went back to Washington, and this time Marshall told him he doubted any more units would be sent to the Pacific. Asked if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the army, Middleton's reply was that he had retired in 1937, and he intended to be returned to retired status once he was no longer needed as a combat commander.|$|E

500|$|The Celtics were {{ahead by}} nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain {{had left the}} game with an injured leg. West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked {{to return to the}} game. However, Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept Chamberlain on the bench {{until the end of the}} game, saying later that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the lineup {{responsible}} for the comeback. The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years. At age 35, Russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last NBA game. After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West (who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team), clasped his hand and tried to soothe him. Days later, 30,000 enthusiastic Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes, but Russell was not there: the man who said he owed the public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics. It came as so surprising that even Red Auerbach was blindsided, and as a consequence, he made the [...] "mistake" [...] of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center. Although White became a standout Celtics player, the Celtics lacked an All-Star center, went just 34–48 in the next season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1950. In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed, because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for $10,000 to Sports Illustrated. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the winter}} months of the 2007–08 season, Gilberto started {{a limited number of}} games for the Gunners, though he kept his place in the Brazil team, {{starting}} several games for A Seleção. After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel [...] "totally useless" [...] by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto's frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in Brazil's Olympic team in Beijing during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his UK Citizenship test, and that he would subsequently apply for a British passport. April saw Gilberto's season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts – a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 – even managing to score a goal. The goal came against Reading on 19 April, and despite its deflective nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League's Dubious Goals Committee eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. However, Gilberto's return to favour did not stop Arsenal's 2007–08 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less likely to leave the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and possibly even renew his contract at Arsenal. Gilberto finished the 2007–08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.|$|E
