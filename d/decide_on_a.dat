5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini had to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{place for the}} premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could {{take place at the}} Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clich√©d, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|Recently widowed {{housewife}} Evelyn (Judi Dench) must {{sell her}} home to cover huge debts left by her late husband. Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a high-court judge who had spent his first eighteen years in India, abruptly decides to retire and return there. Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) seek a retirement they can afford, having lost most of their savings through investing in their daughter's internet business. Muriel (Maggie Smith), a retired housekeeper prejudiced against Indians, needs a hip replacement operation which can be done far more quickly and inexpensively in India. Madge (Celia Imrie) is hunting for another husband, and Norman (Ronald Pickup), an aging Lothario, is trying to recapture his youth. They each <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> retirement hotel in India, based on pictures on its website.|$|E

5|$|While {{spending}} time with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum realizes {{that she needs to}} leave for a science convention in the Veggie Village. She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too hard with the plant, killing it. They then <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death that he said hello.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win behind one of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E

5|$|The {{referendum}} {{that was}} held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by {{a majority in the}} ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar's dual {{proposal}} for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press {{they could no longer}} publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. Unfortunately, an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a short trip to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.|$|E
