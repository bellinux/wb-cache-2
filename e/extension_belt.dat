More than 50 % of the HP-UHP Orogenic Belt was significantly reworked by Early Cretaceous extensional tectonics. This Early Cretaceous event with a fast cooling period, at 130 - 120 Ma, superimposed on the Early Mesozoic HP-UHP orogenic belt and intensively changed the architecture of this orogen. Each individual segment documents different Early Cretaceous extensional structures, namely the central Tongbaishan domain is a metamorphic core complex (MCC) represented by an A-type non-cylindrical antiform; the central Dabieshan domain is a typical Cordilleran-type migmatite-cored MCC; the Southern Sulu UHP domain is a “wedge-shaped” structure exhumed by a simple detachment fault. These late stage extensional structures expose the previous HP-UHP orogenic belt as fragments along the NCB-SCB boundary.

However, before such systems become commonplace, a number of barriers must be overcome. This paper outlines a number of commonly perceived barriers to FMIPCC application, together {{with a number of}} suggested solutions. The paper advances a design approach for specifying FMIPCC systems for deep pit metalliferous applications. A novel FMIPCC configuration is advanced using a hydraulic excavator in backhoe configuration. Because of the requirement to minimise <b>belt</b> <b>extensions,</b> a mine planning approach is presented based on a series of parallel and radial belt conveyor moves. The FMIPCC system does not fully replace truck-shovel systems. In the proposed mine plan, sinking is undertaken with truck-shovel systems using a series of box cuts, whereas pit ‘widening’ activities are accomplished via the FMIPCC system. Because of inherent differences in mine sequencing, the net present value derived from the FMIPCC mine will differ markedly from that derived from traditional, nested-pit, truck-shovel mining approaches. Therefore, any comparison of the FMIPCC and truck-shovel approaches must take into account radically different mine planning approaches...|$|R

The distinctive mineralogy and geochemistry of the rock and its Sm-Nd and Pb isotopic signatures 1) indicate that it represents a juvenile Grenville-age addition to the crust, 2) support a correlation with the Grenville magmatic province of the western United States, and 3) set a unique pivotal point for a precise reconstruction of Rodinia.

The ensemble mean change in the zonal wind at 500 hPa over eastern Atlantic and Western Europe (EAWE) is characterized by an eastward <b>extension</b> of the <b>belt</b> of zonal winds. Due to the thermal wind relation this is connected to {{changes in the}} tropospheric temperature profile characterized by a warming in the subtropical upper troposphere and a relative surface cooling in the mid-latitudes. The subtropical upper tropospheric warming is related to the downward branch of the mean meridional circulation, whereas the mid-latitude lower tropospheric relative cooling is caused by ocean processes that cool the surface. Differences in the simulated change of the zonal wind over the eastern Atlantic and Western Europe by the CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 models can to a large extend be related to differences in the upper tropospheric subtropical warming and the mid-latitude lower tropospheric relative cooling. Because of the large control of sea surface temperatures (SST) on the tropospheric temperature profile, the simulated change of the zonal wind over the EAWE region by the CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 models can also to a large extend be related to the meridional SST gradient...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{analysis}} and field mapping together with simple geometrical and flexural elastic models, document that two styles of Quaternary extensional tectonics characterized the Gran Sasso range (central Apennines, Italy). In {{the western part}} of the range, extension took place on 10 – 15 -km-long range-front normal faults with associated 600 – 1000 -m-high escarpments showing evidence of Late Glacial–Holocene activity. This topography has been reproduced with a thin elastic plate subjected to the isostatic forces induced by the movement along high-angle (55 °– 65 °) planar normal faults. In the eastern part of the <b>belt</b> <b>extension</b> occurred on shallow-dipping normal faults (30 °– 35 °) which reactivated progressively deeper pre-existing thrusts. In this area antithetic "domino" faults formed to accommodate the mechanical adjustment of the hanging-wall over a variably dipping major fault surface. The eastward increase in shortening, due to the earlier compressional phase, documented in the Gran Sasso belt by previous authors, accounts for the more developed zones of weakness and high topographic relief in the eastern sector. This setting could explain the different styles of extension and the more advanced northeastern limit of normal faulting in the eastern sector. This work suggests that normal faults can originate either with low- or high-angle geometry in the upper crust according to the pre-existing tectonic setting and that topography could be important in controlling the geometry and pattern of migrating normal faulting...|$|R
40|$|The N–S {{trending}} {{belt with}} Grenvillian-age rocks developed in central western Argentina represents {{the basement of}} an allochthonous terrane derived from Laurentia during the Early Paleozoic. The Las Matras pluton (36846 0 S, 67807 0 W) {{is located at the}} southern <b>extension</b> of this <b>belt</b> in the Las Matras Block. It consists of a low-Al tonalitic to trondhjemitic facies characteristic of an arc magmatism. Isotopic studies yielded Grenvillian Rb–Sr (1212 ^ 47 Ma) and Sm–Nd (1188 ^ 47 Ma) ages which, due to the undeformed and non-metamorphosed character of the pluton, are interpreted to represent a crystallization age of around 1200 Ma. Although this age is slightly older than available dates from other exposures of the same belt, and the undeformed feature is also distinctive for Las Matras, the depleted Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of the pluton agree with those from other magmatic rocks involved in that belt. The differences found between Las Matras and the northern exposures indicate that this belt with Grenvillian-age rocks comprises regions of non-homogeneous evolution. Although the correlation of the Lower Paleozoic platform carbonates from the sedimentary cover of the Grenvillian-age basement rocks suggests the surroundings of the Southern Grenville Province (Texas and northern Mexico) as the probable detachment site for the Argentine belt, comparison of magmatic and tectonic processes involved in these basement rocks does not indicate similar evolutions.

These data provide {{an assessment of the}} kinematics and mode of lithospheric extension that the western U. S. Cordillera has experienced in the last 5 - 10 million years. Strain and deformation rates were determined by the seismic moment tensor method using historic seismicity and fault plane solutions. By subdividing the Great Basin into areas of homogeneous strain it was possible to examine regional variations in the strain field. Contemporary deformation of the Great Basin occurs principally along the active seismic zones: the southern Intermountain Seismic Belt - 4. 7 mm/ a maximum deformation rate, along most of the western boundary, the Sierra Nevada front - 28. 0 mm/ a maximum deformation rate, and along the west central Nevada seismic belt - 7. 5 mm/ a maximum deformation rate.

40|$|Two high-penetration seismic {{profiles}} {{across the}} continental margin of north Sicily (southern Tyrrhenian Sea) have been interpreted {{to construct a}} crustal section across the margin {{and to provide a}} three-dimensional perspective on the upper crustal setting of the Solunto High and its structural relationships with the adjacent Cefalù Basin. Crystalline rocks of the Kabilian-Calabrian Units (KCU) are recognized in the Solunto High region and farther to the north. The KCU body is tectonically superimposed onto sedimentary rocks pertaining to the Sicilian-Maghrebian Units (SMU) and the Solunto High corresponds to the thrust sheet culmination. Its occurrence in the Solunto High demonstrates that the Drepano Thrust Front is continuous from the Elimi Chain in the west to the Calabrian-Peloritani in the east. At the crustal scale, the continental margin of north Sicily shows tectonics features typical of most subduction zones and of rifted continental margins. Continental collision was achieved in the (?) Oligocene-early Miocene and caused the superposition of the KCU crystalline rocks on the deep-water carbonate resting on the African continental margin. Contractional deformation persisted until the late Miocene resulting in the tectonic superposition of deep- onto shallow-water carbonates and the formation of the Sicilian-Maghrebian fold-and-thrust <b>belt.</b> <b>Extension</b> began in late (?) Tortonian times, lasted till the early (?) Messinian and caused the opening of the Cefalù Basin and other basins further to the north. Late (?) Messinian-early Pliocene contractional and/or transpressional deformation reactivated previously formed oblique ramps in the inner sector of the thrust belt. This event was responsible for uplift of the KCU in the Solunto High region. In the middle-late Pliocene, renewed extension determined further opening and subsidence of the Cefalù basin. Lithospheric breakup took place in the late Pliocene. Presently, the north Sicily offshore is a zone of compressive stress and the area north of Solunto High is a zone of weakness. © 2005 Elsevier B.

The N.

The architecture of the North Gondwana margin results of three main tectonic-metamorphic events that follow an early Late Silurian (ca 415 Ma) high-pressure metamorphism whose associated structures are poorly documented. The Early Devonian D 1 event is responsible for top-to-the-SW nappes coeval with migmatization and exhumation of high-pressure rocks around 385 - 380 Ma. The Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous D 2 event is a top-to-the-NW shearing coeval with an intermediate pressure-temperature metamorphism dated around 360 - 350 Ma. The Visean D 3 event is a top-to-the-south shearing widespread in the south Massif Central whereas in north Massif Central, D 3 corresponds to the onset of synorogenic <b>extension.</b> The Variscan <b>Belt</b> is also characterized by a widespread magmatism.

40|$|The full vehicle {{simulation}} on durability proving grounds is a {{well established}} technique in the pre-development process of passenger car manufacturers. The respective road surfaces are designed to generate representative spindle loads and typically include events {{that will result in}} large tire deformations. Depending on manufacturer and the combination of vehicle size and wheel properties, these deformations can be so large that the tire belt and/or sidewall have contact with the rim crown (protected by the tire sidewall). The current tendency to low-aspect ratio tires reduces the available deformation capability of the tire while simultaneously introducing larger nonlinearities in the sidewall behavior. This paper is based on a co-development project between Fraunhofer LBF and Honda R&D and is dealing with the development of a tire model, which can accurately handle very large deformations of the tire up to misuse-like applications. The model is based on the LBF tire model CDTire, where several nonlinear <b>extensions</b> of the <b>belt</b> and sidewall model have been implemented to accurately capture the large deformation behavior. These model extensions are also taking the belt/sidewall and sidewall/rim contact into account.

The main innovations are related to the implementation of a new dynamic test rig specially designed by Fraunhofer LBF for large deformation tire testing. With this test rig, new impulses could be derived for the modeling and for the parameter identification procedure. Additionally, first full vehicle simulation results of a very severe event are shown to validate the method of approach, with comparisons to both the respective measurements and the simulation results without the model extensions.

This analysis allowed to distinguish four sectors within the Apennine belt: northern Apennine, central Apennine (including the Umbria-Marche Apennine), southern Apennine, and Calabrian Arc. For each sector an Euler pole of rotation relative to the Sardinia-Corsica block was determined starting from the identified morphostructures. The temporal range associated to each stage pole and the rotation angles were determined on the basis of geologic constraints and closure of the kinematic circuit. The model is presented through a series of reconstructions illustrating the genesis of the structures bounding the Apennine sectors, which were associated with different directions of extension within the Tyrrhenian basin. The main geologic implications of the model are represented by the compatibility of the tectonic structures predicted along the boundaries of the Apennine sectors during the rotation and the lateral structural variations that can be observed along the <b>belt.</b> <b>Extension</b> results from diverging directions of migration between two sectors, whereas compression is associated with converging directions. In this model extension along a sector boundary is responsible for the transverse structures which are known as “AntiApennine faults”, for the formation of transverse wedge-top basins, for low-angle faulting not compatible with the Tyrrhenian directions of extension, and for the exhumation of deep parts of thrust belts. Conversely, converging directions of migration between the central and southern sectors of the Apennine chain, which are associated with the kinematic of extension within the Vavilov Basin, form the contractional structures that can be observed along the Ancona-Anzio and Volturno-Sangro lineaments...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages {{from the}} upper Pleistocene part of Hole 1087 A (0 to 12. 1 meters below seafloor) are {{investigated}} to assess the role of global and local climate changes on surface circulation in the southern Benguela region. The benthic stable isotope record indicates that the studied interval {{is representative of the}} last four climatic cycles, that is, down to marine isotope Stage (MIS) 12. The species assemblages bear a clear transitional to subpolar character, with Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (d), Globorotalia inflata, and Globigerina bulloides, in order of decreasing abundance, as the dominant taxa. This species association presently characterizes the mixing domain of old upwelled and open ocean waters, seaward of the Benguela upwelling cells. Abundance variation of the dominant foraminiferal species roughly follows a glacial-interglacial pattern down to MIS 8, suggesting an alternation of upwelling strength and associated seaward <b>extension</b> of the <b>belt</b> of upwelled water as a response to global climate changes. This pattern is interrupted from ~ 250 ka down to MIS 12, where the phase relationship with global climate is ill defined and might be interpreted as a local response of the southern Benguela region to the mid-Brunhes event. Of particular interest is a single pulse of newly upwelled waters at the location of Site 1087 during early MIS 9 as indicated by a peak abundance of sinistral N. pachyderma (s). Variable input of warm, salty Indian Ocean thermocline waters into the southeast Atlantic, a key component of the Atlantic heat conveyor, is indicated by abundance changes of the tropical taxon Globorotalia menardii. From this tracer, we suggest that interocean exchange was hardly interrupted throughout the last 460 k. y., but was most effective at glacial terminations, particularly during Terminations I and II, as well as during the upper part of MIS 12. This maximum input of Indian Ocean waters around the southern tip of Africa is associated with the reseeding of G. menardii in the tropical Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|We present field, petrographic, {{major and}} trace element data for komatiites and komatiite basalts from Sargur Group Nagamangala greenstone belt, western Dharwar craton. Field evidences such as crude pillow {{structure}} indicate their eruption in a marine environment whilst spinifex texture reveals their komatiite nature. Petrographic {{data suggest that}} the primary mineralogy has been completely altered during post-magmatic processes associated with metamorphism corresponding to greenschist to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The studied komatiites contain serpentine, talc, tremolite, actinolite and chlorite whilst tremolite, actinolite with minor plagioclase in komatiitic basalts. Based on the published Sm-Nd whole rock isochron ages of adjoining Banasandra komatiites (northern <b>extension</b> of Nagamangala <b>belt)</b> and further northwest in Nuggihalli belt and Kalyadi belt we speculate ca. 3. 2 – 3. 15  Ga for komatiite eruption in Nagamangala belt. Trace element characteristics particularly HFSE and REE patterns suggest that most of the primary geochemical characteristics are preserved with minor influence of post-magmatic alteration and/or contamination. About 1 / 3 of studied komatiites show Al-depletion whilst remaining komatiites and komatiite basalts are Al-undepleted. Several samples despite high MgO, (Gd/Yb) N ratios show low CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios. Such anomalous values could be related to removal of CaO from komatiites during fluid-driven hydrothermal alteration, thus lowering CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios. The elemental characteristics of Al-depleted komatiites such as higher (Gd/Yb) N (> 1. 0), CaO/Al 2 O 3 (> 1. 0), Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 (18) together with higher HREE, Y, Zr suggest their derivation from shallower upper mantle without garnet involvement in residue. The observed chemical characteristics (CaO/Al 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2, MgO, Ni, Cr, Nb, Zr, Y, Hf, and REE) indicate derivation of the komatiite and komatiite basalt magmas from heterogeneous mantle (depleted to primitive mantle) at different depths in hot spot environments possibly with a rising plume. The low content of incompatible elements in studied komatiites suggest existence of depleted mantle during ca. 3. 2  Ga which in turn imply an earlier episode of mantle differentiation, greenstone volcanism and continental growth probably during ca. 3. 6 – 3. 3  Ga which is substantiated by Nd and Pb isotope data of gneisses and komatiites in western Dharwar craton (WDC) ...|$|R
