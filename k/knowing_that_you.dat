The lighting is kept low, drawing attention to the visuals on the LED curtains used throughout the tour and obscuring much of the band members' facial features in shadow. Courtes and Fougerol explained: [...] "we wanted to reflect the mood we've seen at the concerts, so we played with that lighting <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are more blinded from a light if it was darker before".|$|E
500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't do a damn thing about it before your lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E

In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1970 {{review of}} memory research, Tulving and Madigan {{concluded}} that {{advances in the}} study of memory might require the experimental investigation of “one of the truly unique characteristics of human memory: its knowledge of its own knowledge”. It was around the same time that John H. Flavell coined the term [...] "metamemory" [...] in a discussion on the development of memory. Since then, numerous metamemory phenomena have been studied, including judgments of learning, feelings of knowing, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know, and know vs. remember.|$|E
2500|$|One day, Jonathan met two gulls {{who took}} him to a [...] "higher plane of existence" [...] in which there was no heaven but a better world found through {{perfection}} of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him [...] "pretty well a one-in-a-million bird." [...] In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang says, is to [...] "begin by <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have already arrived." [...] Not satisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like him, to bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1955 investigation, Moseley {{found other}} flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed {{several of the}} people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these {{witnesses}} contradicted Adamski's claims. One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard [...] "a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc." [...] several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a [...] "planned operation." [...] Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: [...] "Now you know the [...] picture connected to your name is in the book (Flying Saucers Have Landed) too. And with people <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are connected with flying saucers...you could do yourself a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E
