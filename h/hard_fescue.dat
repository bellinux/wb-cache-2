40|$|Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as an alternative to}} perennial ryegrass, particularly in conditions of moisture limitation, but there is little comparative information on the plant characteristics influencing regrowth in the two species, particularly under continuous stocking. The objectives of this study were to :i) examine the response of tall fescue to continuous stocking in terms of tillering activity, leaf growth and competition, and ii) determine which physiological or morphological factors are important in influencing regrowth after defoliation, using perennial ryegrass as a reference standard. Experiments were undertaken in field, glasshouse and controlled environment conditions. In the field sown swards of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cv. 'Grassland Roa') and white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv. 'Grassland Tahora'), with volunteer grasses mainly consisting of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. cv. 'Grassland Nui') were continuously stocked with varying numbers of sheep to maintain sward surface heights 90 - 100 mm (Lax, L), 50 - 60 mm (Medium, M) and 30 - 4 0 mm (Hard, H). Measurements were made on areas with and without clover by removal of white clover with clopyralid. Tiller population density, tiller weight, and leaf growth and productivity of tall fescue were all reduced under <b>hard</b> grazing. Tall <b>fescue</b> was susceptible to competition from companion species, particularly perennial ryegrass, and tended to be replaced by other species under hard grazing. Under glasshouse conditions individual plants of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass were defoliated to stubble heights of 100 mm (Lax, L), 60 mm (Medium, M), 30 mm (Hard 1, H 1) and 30 mm (Hard 2, H 2) 9 times with 5 day intervals over a period of 4 5 days. Treatments L, M, and H 1 were initiated at an average of 1 1 tillers per plant for each species; treatment H 2 commenced at 6 tillers per plant. Both species showed sensitivity to severe cutting treatments by reduction in tiller number, tiller weight, leaf growth and less shoot and root growth. Tall fescue showed lower leaf growth, tillering activity and herbage harvested per plant than perennial regress, but it produced larger tillers. The comparative response of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass to leaf defoliation was studied under controlled environment conditions at both the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth. The oldest leaf lamina was defoliated regularly to maintain four, three, two or only one live leaf per tiller for six or seven leaf appearance intervals. In both species repeated removal of older leaves had little effect on tiller production, tiller weight, leaf growth rate and consequently total accumulated shoot and root weight, and mean shoot and root relative growth rates. Removal of all fully expanded leaves resulted in significant reduction in the above components, though leaf elongation rate was little affected. Leaves were shorter, narrower and lighter under hard defoliation, but leaf appearance rate was not affected. Hard defoliation affected tall fescue tiller weight more than perennial ryegrass. Water soluble carbohydrate concentrations in stem bases of plants decreased with increasing severity of defoliation especially for tall fescue. Leaf photosynthetic capacity per unit area was not influenced by defoliation intensity, but photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf weight increased under hard defoliation. Hard defoliation decreased the proportion of root mass to shoot mass, and increased the proportion of leaf mass to shoot mass. Plants showed relatively similar sensitivity to defoliation at vegetative and reproductive phases of growth. At both phases tall fescue again produced larger tillers with longer leaves and had a longer leaf life-span than perennial ryegrass, but it had lower leaf growth and appearance, and produced fewer tillers per plant. Photosynthetic activity per unit leaf area was similar for the two species, but tall fescue often had lower photosynthetic rate per unit leaf weight than perennial ryegrass. In conclusion, hard defoliation intensity reduced both tiller population density and tiller weight and consequently decreased pasture regrowth through a reduction in LAI, life-span of leaf area, photosynthetic efficiency, and shortage of carbohydrate reserves. The factors that resulted in the regrowth of tall fescue being less responsive to hard defoliation than perennial ryegrass were slower leaf turnover, slower leaf appearance rate, lower tillering capacity and longer leaf lifespan. These resulted in lack of plasticity in tiller population density of tall fescue in response to hard defoliation...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe differences in tillering patterns in <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> and Chewings fescue in response to various post harvest residue management treatments. Burn and crewcut (clip and vacuum) post harvest residue management treatments were applied on two different dates.

A number of alternative grass species, not widely used as turf, show significant potential {{for use as}} turf in the United States northern Midwest. Many alternative species have also exhibited better adaptation to low-maintenance conditions than traditionally used species, {{and it is also}} probable that these alternative species may have superior tolerance to common turf pests, specifically diseases. Yet, the use of alternative grass species as a novel integrated pest management strategy has not been explicitly evaluated. In this research, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of alternative turfgrass species as an integrated pest management strategy in Minnesota. The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate the field performance of four alternative turfgrass species including <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca trachyphylla (Hackel) Krajina), colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.), and prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.), under different low-input management regimes in Minnesota. Species were evaluated for turfgrass quality, weed cover, live cover, and disease resistance at two locations in Minnesota over two years. Fertilizer treatment and mowing height significantly affected species performance, and the results indicate that alternative grasses, specifically <b>hard</b> <b>fescue,</b> can be excellent options for lower-input landscapes. Two additional experiments were conducted to determine the economic viability of using alternative grass species as a pest management strategy. First, a choice experiment with real products was conducted to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) of Minnesota homeowners for maintenance attributes of turfgrasses. Homeowners were willing to pay significant premiums for turfgrasses with reduced irrigation and mowing requirements. Secondly, conjoint analysis was used to further investigate the consumer preferences of Minnesota homeowners for aesthetic and maintenance attributes of turfgrasses, as well as identify potential market segments in the residential turfgrass market. The results suggest that maintenance attributes significantly influence consumer purchasing behavior, and they also identify a strong consumer preference for reduced irrigation and mowing requirements. The analysis also identified four potential consumer segments: the “Price Conscious” segment (consumers who value low cost), the “Shade Adaptation” segment (consumers who value grasses that can grow in the shade), the “Mowing Conscious” segment (consumers who value reduced mowing requirement), and the “Water Conscious” segment (consumers who value grasses with reduced water-use requirements).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate early establishment characteristics and germination pattern of fine-textured fescues (FF) under natural room temperature and to analyze differences between alternative and natural conditions for a practical application. Six cultivars from Chewings fescue (CF), creeping red fescue (CRF), <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> (HF) and sheep fescue (SF) were evaluated in the study. Daily and cumulative germination pattern were measured and analyzed. Significant differences were greatly observed in germination pattern, days to the first germination, days to 60 % germination, and germination percentage with environments, species and cultivars. Final germination rate was 29. 7 to 80. 0 % under natural conditions. The first germination was initiated between 8 and 10 DAS (days after seeding) under natural conditions, being 3 to 4 days later as compared with ISTA conditions. Days to the 60 % germination were 12. 1 to 19. 0 DAS, being 3. 0 to 4. 2 days slower than that under ISTA conditions. CF ‘Jamestown II ’ was the fastest cultivar, while the slowest CRF ‘Audubon’. Turf establishment speed was faster with CRF < SF < HF and < CF in order.

Several species that are not currently included in the MnDOT recommendations for these sites have performed well in low-input turfgrass evaluations in Minnesota and warranted evaluation for salt tolerance and suitability for roadside environments. The goal of this project was to develop a recommended mixture or a set of mixtures that provide salt-tolerant sod for roadsides. In {{the first part of this}} research, cultivars of cool-season turfgrass were assessed for their ability to establish and survive on roadsides in Minnesota. Concurrently, these grasses were evaluated in a hydroponic system in the greenhouse for salinity tolerance. Together, these studies identified several species and cultivars that were promising for use on Minnesota roadsides. These top-performing grasses were then evaluated in a series of mixtures in three research trials: (1) a roadside evaluation at two locations in Minnesota; (2) a sod strength trial planted at two locations in Minnesota; and (3) an acute drought evaluation utilizing an automated rainout shelter.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of using various molecular methods of genetic fingerprinting for species, sub-species and cultivar identification of fine fescues, a cool-season turfgrass, was investigated because currently used morphological markers do not easily distinguish among them.

RAPD based markers proved to be superior to minisatellite markers in identifying species and subspecies RAPD analysis was less successful in distinguishing varieties within a species. Human probes yielded nonspecific hybridization patterns which prevented the identification of useful fingerprinting markers. The M 13 probe gave rise to specific hybridizations, {{in contrast to the}} human probes, but was unable to distinguish between plants even at the species level. The microsatellite (GATA) n proved to be the most versatile probe, since it could distinguish between varieties as well as between germplasm accessions, thus proving its potential use in genetic and other fingerprinting studies. ^ We used RAPD-based molecular markers to study the inheritance of endophytic Acremonium association with turfgrass, an important turf trait.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major. Applied Plant Sciences. Advisors: Dr. Brian Horgan and Dr. Eric Watkins. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 166 pages. Roadsides present significant challenges to maintaining functional and sustainable vegetation {{due to the}} presence of multiple stresses that can be extreme. These stresses may include drought, heat, disease, and in cold-weather climates exposure to deicing salts used during winter road maintenance practices. Mixtures of cool-season turfgrasses can be used to create high quality roadside vegetation that can withstand these stresses. The current specification for roadside turfgrass in Minnesota included outdated cultivars and was in need of reassessment. The purpose of this research was to identify the best cultivars for use on roadsides in Minnesota and to create a suitable mixture of those cultivars that would maximize establishment and survival. In {{the first part of this}} research, cultivars of cool-season turfgrass were assessed for their ability to establish and survive on roadsides in Minnesota. This was accomplished by visually assessing fall-seeded plots on roadsides for establishment and, subsequently, survival the following spring. Successful establishment and survival were related to edaphic characteristic; specifically, soil compaction and moisture. In cold weather climates like that in Minnesota, salt tolerance is a required trait of roadside vegetation due to the application of deicing salts in the winter. As such, the same cultivars were directly assessed for salt tolerance in nutrient solution culture amended with sodium chloride to 4, 14, and 24 dS m - 1. Assessment of salt tolerance was accomplished using digital image analysis to quantify percent green tissue remaining following the different severities of salt exposure. Following exposure to the lowest level of salt stress, no significant differences were observed between cultivars in the trial. Following moderate salt stress, significant differences were identified between cultivars of turfgrass, including between cultivars within species. Specifically, between cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). However, under extreme salt stress no significant differences existed between cultivars within any given species, and trends among the mean tolerance of each species were dominant. Overall, cultivars of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and slender creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. ssp. litoralis) retained the greatest amount of green tissue. An improved method of evaluating turfgrass seed mixtures was needed before creation of an ideal mixture for Minnesota roadsides was possible. A novel approach to design and analysis of seed mixture experiments was introduced. The method used a plant community-level approach to identify the optimal species mixture. To demonstrate the method, a simple four-species mixture experiment was established in a growth chamber using a simplex-centroid design of seed mixture proportions. Polynomial regression analysis and augmented Lagrangian numerical optimization were used to predict a mixture that would maximize total dry clippings biomass over 19 wk. From this experiment, the method was proven successful as the predicted optimal mixture of 83 % perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) - 17 % <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> [Festuca trachyphylla (Hack.) Krajina], by seed count, was shown to produce a similar or greater amount of clippings biomass as compared to all of the design point mixtures. That plant community-level approach to seed mixture design and analysis was applied to mixtures of nine turfgrass species on roadsides with the additional requirement that each mixture contain more than two species. A single cultivar was chosen to represent each species based on the previous evaluations of roadside establishment and survival as well as direct evaluation of salt tolerance. Mixtures were established at two roadside locations and evaluated for green canopy cover and weed encroachment over two years. Data from digital image analysis and grid-intersect counts indicated that inclusion of tall fescue in the seed mixture significantly decreased the probability of retaining at least 60 % cover after two years. In contrast, inclusion of <b>hard</b> <b>fescue,</b> sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L.), and slender creeping red fescue each increased the probability of retaining at least 60 % cover.

A two year test was conducted on a closely mowed Tifgreen bermudagrass turf which was infected with visual symptoms of necrotic patches of turf, and various degrees of blighting. The test included a broad representation of turf species for overseeding {{in an effort to}} (1) determine selected specie/cultivar susceptibility and disease expression to rapid blight in the field and (2) survey and assess the association of laboratory isolate detection from field sampling, with disease occurrence and severity of expression of field maintained overseed turf. Over a two year period, Rapid blight, caused by Labyrinthula terrestris was capable of infesting most cool season grasses in this test. In year one, Dawson CRF, SRX 555 slender creeping red fescue, and SR 105210 slender creeping red fescue showed no positive lab detection results from field plots. In year two (2003 - 2004), only SRX 555 SLQ had only 1 plot known to carry Labyrinthula throughout the main infestation season. In year two, essentially all turf plots showed some symptomology of disease expression. This was confirmed by lab identification. Tiller infection rates varied from 2 % to 80 % infection in the lab from field samples. The relationship between tiller infection rates and field plot disease expression was determined by Pearson’s product and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients.

With golf course water, fertilizer, and pesticide {{restrictions on the}} rise and labor costs continuing to increase, golf course superintendents {{are looking for ways}} to reduce maintained Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) rough. The objective of this study was to (i) compare several methods for converting Kentucky bluegrass roughs to no-mow, low-input grasses and (ii) determine the best turfgrass species that provides a playable and aesthetically pleasing turfgrass stand for this type of conversion. Five grass species and five conversion methods were evaluated at two locations in Minnesota (Maple Grove, MN and St. Paul, MN). Data collected included visual stand quality, tendency for lodging, inflorescence counts, biomass production, Kentucky bluegrass regrowth, and broadleaf weed invasion. At Maple Grove, the fumigation treatment provided the highest visual stand quality ratings and the sod removal treatment at St. Paul provided the highest visual stand quality. Only sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L.) was able to provide acceptable visual stand quality by Year 2 and only at St. Paul. Chewing’s fesuce (Festuca rubra L. ssp. commutata Gaudin) and strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra) were best at resisting broadleaf weed invasion at both locations. <b>Hard</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca brevipila Tracey) was best at resisting lodging along with strong creeping red fescue in Year 2 at both locations. Due to its perennial nature and rhizomatous growth habit, it may be difficult to obtain complete control of Kentucky bluegrass when converting to a no-mow, low-input area. Selective removal of Kentucky bluegrass regrowth may be needed when converting to low-maintenance grasses. Previous studies have shown that fine fescues (Festuca spp.) have a high tolerance to the herbicide sethoxydim (2 -[1 -(ethoxyimino) butyl]- 5 -[2 -(ethylthio) propyl]- 3 -hydroxy- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one) and it may provide the answer when needing to selectively remove Kentucky bluegrass from fine fescue. The objectives of this second study were (i) to compare the tolerance of cool-season turfgrass species and cultivars to sethoxydim and (ii) determine species tolerance at different application rates. Four herbicide rates (0. 0, 1. 315, 2. 630, and 5. 26 L·ha- 1) were applied to fifteen coolseason grasses (5 Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, 3 tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa [L. ] Beauv.) cultivars and selections, ‘Gator’ perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), ‘Plantation’ tall fescue, (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), a native prairie junegrass breeding line (Koeleria macrantha [Ledeb. ] Schult.), and 4 species of fine fescues.

In the cool-season {{region of the}} United States, golf courses traditionally grow high-input grasses like creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera, L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis, L.), annual bluegrass (Poa annua, L.), and/or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) on fairways. Grass species exist that are more sustainable than those currently being used for golf course fairway turf. Low-input fine fescue species could be able to withstand the pressure from typical turfgrass disease and stresses while producing acceptable turf and excellent playing quality with fewer overall inputs of pesticides, water, and fertilizer. Little {{research has been conducted}} on these species in a fairway setting, so golf course managers have been hesitant to use fine fescues. This project conducted research to overcome these barriers and thus begin using low-input fine fescues for fairways on golf courses throughout the northern United States. The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate fine fescue species’ performance as fairway turfgrass under an acute drought. Field trials were conducted at two locations under a rainout shelter. Mixtures that contained large proportions (> 33 %) of Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra ssp. commutata (Thuill.) Nyman] had the greatest green cover {{at the end of the}} drought period. The marginal effects summary revealed no significant differences among species success after drought. Overall, this study found that fine fescues can provide acceptable turf quality and playability on golf course fairways resulting in lower irrigation inputs. The objectives of the second project were to determine the effect of the plant growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl on the performance of fine fescue mixtures when managed as a golf course fairway and identify fine fescue mixtures that perform well under traffic stress. The marginal effects summaries showed <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> [Festuca trachyphylla (Hack.) Krajina], slender creeping red fescue [Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis (G. F. W. Meyer) Auquier. ], strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra ssp. rubra Gaudin), and sheep fescue (Festuca ovina, L.) had the greatest component effect on visual turfgrass quality, and were all statistically similar. Strong creeping red fescue was more susceptible to dollar spot disease (caused by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett) than the other species. The third experiment evaluated fine fescue species and mixtures for snow mold resistance on three golf courses in Minnesota. In the spring of 2013, 2014, and 2015, there was no damage from snow mold. These grasses may be resistant to the pathogens; however, our observations in higher cut fine fescue suggest that snow mold and snow scald diseases can be a problem in these grasses. Although the objective to determine if fine fescue fairways require fungicides at currently-recommended application rates to survive winter snow mold pressure was not accomplished, turf quality data taken over 2 years was analyzed. Mixtures maintained significantly better turfgrass quality than any of the five species alone...|$|E

The development of low-input turfgrasses has been challenging for plant breeders. Turfgrasses typically lack resources for crop improvement {{that are common}} in other crops, such as a fully sequenced genome. New tools are needed to study turfgrass and decrease its environmental impact. Two approaches were developed and utilized in this project: investigating the rhizosphere associated with low-input turfgrasses and quantifying silica body deposition in various turfgrass species. Understanding how microorganisms associate with different species and cultivars of turfgrass may in the future provide researchers the ability to breed for turfgrass plants that form better mutualistic and beneficial relationships with soil microorganisms. In some plants, plant genotype {{seems to have a}} significant influence on shaping the microbial community structures. Previous research in Poaceae has shown that a plant genotype has the ability to influence the rhizosphere microbial community structure. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if turfgrass species affects soil microbial community structure and (2) identify differences in soil microbial community structure of turfgrasses based on nitrogen fertility regime. Rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples were taken from six species of turfgrass, prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), <b>hard</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca trachyphylla (Hackel) Krajina), colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.), as well as tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.) and DNA isolated from each sample was then amplicons were pair end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at a read length of 2 x 150 base pairs. Data was analyzed using WinSCP, Putty and Mothur. Our results show that the rhizosphere community structure is influenced by location, fertility, and genotype. iii We also found that Thermodesulfobacteria and Thaumarchaeota are associated with fertilized turfgrass soils. Weed incidence, a measure of turf performance, was found to associate to the Actinobacteria, Verrumicrobia, and Bacteroidetes. Results from this research will inform turfgrass researchers about the impacts of turfgrass species and nitrogen fertility on soil microbial communities. The deposition of silicon into epidermic cells of grass species is thought to be an important mechanism that plants use to defend against pests and environmental stresses. Turfgrass cultivars within the same species exhibit different tolerances under traffic stress and some of these differences may be attributed to silica bodies. There are a number of techniques available to study the size, density and distribution pattern of silica bodies in grass leaves. None of those techniques, however, can provide a high-throughput and accurate analysis, especially for a great number of samples. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a high-throughput method that uses the fluorescence-emitting nature of silica bodies along with fluorescence microscopy and image software to investigate the size, density, and distribution patterns of these bodies in the perennial grass Koeleria macrantha. Dry ashing, followed by fluorescent microscopy, was utilized to image silica bodies in prairie junegrass. ImageJ was used to analyze the images for size, number and orientation. We found that dry-ashing and fluorescent microscopy can be combined with ImageJ to create a high throughput method to study silica bodies in turfgrass. Our results indicated that abaxial and adaxial deposition in turfgrasses are significantly different and that turfgrass genotypes showed significant differences in number of carbon inclusions and silica body deposition...|$|E
