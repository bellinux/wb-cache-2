5000|$|With {{all this}} {{internal}} investment, Watson was, in essence, gambling on the future. It was IBM's first ‘Bet the Company’ gamble, but the risk paid off handsomely. Watson's factories, running full tilt {{for six years}} with no market to sell to, created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment, straining IBM's resources. To reduce the cash drain, the struggling Dayton Scale Division (the <b>food</b> <b>services</b> <b>equipment</b> business) was sold in 1933 to Hobart Manufacturing for stock. [...] When the Social Security Act of 1935 - labeled as [...] "the biggest accounting operation of all time" [...] - came up for bid, IBM was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment. Watson's gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. IBM's successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders, {{and by the end}} of the decade IBM had not only safely negotiated the Depression, but risen to the forefront of the industry. Watson's Depression-era decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities, education to expand the breadth of those capabilities, and his commitment to the data processing product line laid the foundation for 50 years of IBM growth and successes.|$|R

40|$|Mergers and Acquisitions {{research}} often {{focuses on}} the prices paid, as a multiple of earnings or cash flow, by strategic acquirers for their targets. These multiples are salient to this body of research, as they {{form the basis of}} company valuation on a theoretical and practical level. A variety of factors influence the size of these multiples, including prevailing macroeconomic conditions, the particular industry of the target company, the target’s profitability, and company-specific factors such as the market’s perceived risk of the target. This paper analyzes the relationship between multiples paid in strategic acquisitions and prevailing macroeconomic conditions, as well as accounting measures of the target company, with the goal of assessing whether or not macroeconomic conditions or company-specific characteristics play a role in determining the multiple paid. Our research contributes to the existing literature by using forecast P/E and EBITDA multiples, which provide a more forward-looking picture of how targets are valued.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess <b>food</b> <b>service</b> organizations’ {{experiences}} with the implementation of P/PM 150, perceived strengths and weaknesses of <b>food</b> <b>services</b> organizations implementing P/PM 150, and perceived opportunities and threats to the policy’s implementation. Methods. Semi-structured interviews were done with <b>food</b> <b>service</b> organizations selling <b>food</b> to Waterloo Region schools. <b>Food</b> <b>services</b> identified perceptions of and experiences with P/PM 150. Interview responses were coded using ‘open coding’, coding was based on the SWOT analysis, a reliability test was conducted, and matrix coding was used to compare food services’ attributes to their experiences implementing P/PM 150. Results. <b>Food</b> <b>services</b> that had a good experience mentioned more ‘opportunities’ resulting from the policy and more ‘strengths’ within their company. Both <b>food</b> <b>services</b> that had a negative or positive experience mentioned an equal number of ‘threats’. However, <b>food</b> <b>services</b> that had negative experiences mentioned more ‘weaknesses’ than those that had positive experiences. More small <b>food</b> <b>services,</b> and <b>food</b> <b>services</b> that serve elementary schools identified having a good experience with the policy. All <b>food</b> <b>services</b> that identified themselves as healthy before implementing the policy had a positive experience with the policy. The main factor that determined whether <b>food</b> <b>services</b> had a negative experience implementing the policy was if the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> had to make many changes to their menu to comply with P/PM 150. Conclusions. Collecting additional data on the compliance of <b>food</b> <b>services,</b> the role of education in policy acceptance, and schools’, parents’, and students’ experiences with the policy would be beneficial to get a full understanding of the policy’s impact...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} - Past, Present, and Future: The <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Industry and Its Changes - by Brother Herman E. Zaccarelli, International Director, Restaurant, Hotel and Institutional Management Institute at Purdue University, Brother Zaccarelli {{initially}} states: “Educators {{play an important}} role in the evolution of the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> industry. The author discusses that evolution and suggests how educators can be change agents along with management in that evolutionary progression. ” The author goes on to wax philosophically, as well as speak generically about the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> industry; to why it offers fascinating and rewarding careers. Additionally, he writes about the influence educators have on students in this regard. “Educators can speak about how the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> industry has benefited them both personally and professionally,” says Brother Zaccarelli. “We get excited about alerting students to the many opportunities and, in fact, serve as “salespersons” for the industry to whoever (school administrators, legislators, and peers in the educational institution) will listen. ” Brother Zaccarelli also speaks to growth and changes in <b>food</b> <b>service,</b> and even more importantly about the people and faces behind everything that <b>food</b> <b>service,</b> and hospitality in general comprise. The author will have you know, that people are what drive an educator. “What makes the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> industry so great? At the heart of this question 2 ̆ 7 s answer is people: the people whom it serves in institutional and commercial operations of all types; the people who work within it; the people who provide the goods, <b>services,</b> and <b>equipment</b> to it; the people who study it,” says Brother Zaccarelli. “All of these groups have, of course, a vested personal and/or professional interest in seeing our industry improve. ” Another concept the author would like you to absorb, and it’s even more so true today than yesterday, is the prevalence of convergence and divergence within <b>food</b> <b>service.</b> For <b>food</b> <b>service</b> and beyond, it is the common denominators and differences that make the hospitality-food service industry so dynamic and vibrant. These are the winds of change presented to an educator who wants to have a positive impact on students. The author warns that the many elements involved in the <b>food</b> <b>service</b> industry conspire to erode quality of service in an industry that is also persistently expanding, and whose cornerstone principles are underpinned by service itself. “The three concerns addressed - quality, employees, and marketing - are intimately related,” Brother Zaccarelli says in stripping-down the industry to bare essentials. He defines and addresses the issues related to each with an eye toward how education can reconcile said issues...|$|R

And, if in fact they do, what can be done to eliminate these impediments. It is the opinion of the author that there may lie an inherent rift between the advancement of technology on <b>food</b> <b>service</b> <b>equipment</b> and either the training that accompanies such equipment or skill level of today s food service worker. A 13 question survey instrument has been developed and administered via telephone interview to 50 respondents of which 46 participated resulting in a 92 % response rate. The 46 respondents were selected from business reply cards that were included in electronically controlled <b>food</b> <b>service</b> <b>equipment</b> that they had purchased. This alleviated the possibility that any of the respondents were not familiar with this type of equipment and guaranteed that their answers were to be germane to the study. Data and statistical analysis have been collated by Minitab, a statistical analysis program, and its outcome can be found in the Findings and Analysis section of this study. From the sample of 46 participants, the survey showed that the average respondent was: 30 to 34 years of age, has had some college, in a middle management position, has been involved in the food service industry for 11 to 15 years, operates an ethnic theme restaurant, operates cooking equipment that has electronic touch controls, has had some form of training on the equipment with electronic touch controls, were trained at the place of business and were predominantly self-trained.
