2500|$|Webb {{was found}} dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. After a local paper {{reported}} that he had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had committed suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: [...] "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." [...] News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his 'Dark Alliance' series, published eight years before, but Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had committed suicide. [...] "The way he was acting it would be <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was anything but suicide," [...] she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{go out of}} {{the house}} for a walk, {{uncertain}} as yet whither I will bend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me, I find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and inevitably settle southwest, toward some particular wood or meadow or deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to settle,--varies a few degrees, and does not always point due southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this 'variation, but it always settles between west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side. The outline which would bound my walks would be, not a circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been thought to be non-returning curves, in this case opening westward, in which my house occupies the place of the sun. I turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour, until I decide, for a thousandth time, that I will walk into the southwest or west. Eastward I go only by force; but westward I go free. Thither no business leads me. It is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that I shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon. I am not excited by the prospect of a walk thither; but I believe that the forest which I see in the western horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me. Let me live where I will, on this side is the city, on that the wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and more, and withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much stress on this fact, if I did not believe that something like this is the prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe. And that way the nation is moving, and I may say that mankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have witnessed the phenomenon of a southeastward migration, in the settlement of Australia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement, and, judging from the moral and physical character of the first generation of Australians, has not yet proved a successful experiment. The eastern Tartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet. [...] "The world ends there," [...] say they, [...] "beyond there is nothing but a shoreless sea." [...] It is unmitigated East where they live.|$|E

Napolitano stated, [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that World Trade Center came down by itself. I was gratified to see Geraldo Rivera investigating it." ...|$|E

[...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he went to Mexico and accepted a big payoff," [...] George Gaines told Garrison. [...] "That's not the same man who presented himself during the trial. I don't believe he would compromise his integrity like that." [...] Another great-niece, Tracy Berry, who went to law school herself and became a federal prosecutor, agrees: When you think of those old photos of lynchings and burned bodies, who wouldn't want to think that he lived a full life in Mexico? But based on the love my grandmother and great-grandmother had for their brother and son, that's really hard for me to reconcile. If he wanted to walk away, there are easier ways to do it than to sever ties from the entire family." [...] She has since told The New York Times that she believes her great-uncle was murdered.|$|E

5000|$|FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, {{who was one}} of the two commissioners {{who opposed}} the net {{neutrality}} proposal, criticized the FCC's ruling on Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they don’t like are non-existent: [...] "The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it’s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren’t enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality. The bogeyman never had it so easy." [...] FCC Commissioner Mike O'Reilly, the other opposing commissioner, also claims that the ruling is a solution to a hypothetical problem, [...] "Even after enduring three weeks of spin, it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the Commission is establishing an entire Title II/net neutrality regime to protect against hypothetical harms. There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a ‘prophylactic’ approach. I call it guilt by imagination." [...] In a Chicago Tribune article, FCC Commissioner Pai and Joshua Wright of the Federal Trade Commission argue that [...] "the Internet isn't broken, and we don't need the president's plan to 'fix' it. Quite the opposite. The Internet is an unparalleled success story. It is a free, open and thriving platform." ...|$|E
40|$|As {{we begin}} the next millennium, I am {{reminded}} of our progress, as an educational community and as a professional organization. Technology {{is no longer a}} new venture.

Except for the uncle in whose home I grew up, he came the closest, non-biologically speaking of course, to being (ah there, Dr. Freud) my father. More than that, he was for well over thirty years a hero of mine who never once—and I mean never once—let me down. I cannot write dispassionately of Charlie Clark...|$|E
