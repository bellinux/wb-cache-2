5|$|All {{identification}} of people {{was performed in}} Tromsø, as a cooperation between Troms Police District, National Criminal Investigation Service and the University Hospital of North Norway. By 18 September, all people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified,</b> and the bodies were transported to Russia and Ukraine on 20 September after a short memorial in Tromsøhallen. An autopsy was performed on all crew members, without finding any abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|EU {{legislation}} on dehorning practices {{is expected to}} place greater pressure to breed polled cattle, which is being pursued in France by the GIE Polled Excellence group. Because no French Limousins <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> with the polled gene, a breeding programme commenced in 2005 with polled Canadian bulls of phenotype closest to the French breed standard.|$|E

5|$|A puppy born in 2012 named Jack Junior, or J.J., began {{assisting}} Jack in April 2012, {{allowing the}} older Jack to retire after the 2012–13 school year and transfer his duties to Jack Junior. However, university administrators determined in July 2013 that J.J. {{would not be}} the school's mascot going forward. By the end of August 2013, a new puppy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> from the same breeders, and John B. Carroll was introduced to the campus in October 2013.|$|E

50|$|However many {{examples}} of DHHC domains are known that do not contain all these conserved residues. In addition to the central DHHC domain three further sequence motifs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> in members of the DHHC family. A DPG (aspartate-proline-glycine) motif <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> just to the C-terminus of the second transmembrane region. A TTxE (threonine-threonine-any-glutamate) motif <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> after the fourth transmembrane helix. A third motif towards the C-terminus of many proteins <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> that contains a conserved aromatic amino acid, a glycine and an asparagine called the PaCCT motif (PAlmitoiltransferase Conserved C-Terminus motif).|$|R
5000|$|Prehistoric tsunamis are tsunamis and {{so-called}} [...] "megatsunamis" [...] that occurred before recorded history.

5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> through DNA testing.|$|E
50|$|KIAA1530 is {{a protein}} that in humans that is encoded by the KIAA1530 gene, {{also known as}} UVSSA.

5|$|The orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang) {{are three}} extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are {{currently}} only {{found in the}} rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they {{were divided into two}} species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified,</b> the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis).|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E
50|$|So far four nectins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> in humans, namely nectin-1, nectin-2, nectin-3 and nectin-4.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified.</b> Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
50|$|Multiple miR-744 binding sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> in the {{proximal}} 3' untranslated region of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1).
