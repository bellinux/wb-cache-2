40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the average condylar inclination using ultrasonic axiograph; to {{determine the}} average condylar inclination using protrusive interocclusal bite records; to compare whether there is any marked difference in the values obtained by these techniques. Settings and Design: This clinical study compares the mean horizontal condylar inclination of the ultrasonic axiograph (Axioquick system) and the manual programming using protrusive interocclusal records. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted {{on a group of}} 30 subjects reporting to Department of Prosthodontics. Axioquick software system of SAM III (School Articulator Munich) fully-adjustable articulator was used, and interocclusal recording of condylar inclination is the manual method used in semi-adjustable articulators using Aluwax. The condylar inclination of the articulator was adjusted and set using protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record.</b> Statistical Analysis: The horizontal condylar inclination values of both methods were collected, and the mean of right and left condylar inclination was compared using paired t-test. Results: A statistically significant difference exists between Axioquick system and the manual method of programming articulator with protrusive interocclusal records (P ≤ 0. 001). Conclusions: Within the limitations of the present study, the following conclusions were drawn: The average condylar inclination by axiograph is 42. 125 °. The average condylar inclination by <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> is 33. 25 °.

40|$|Aim : To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} correlation between sagittal condylar guidance obtained by protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> mounted on semi-adjustable articulator with panoramic and Lateral cephalogram radiograph tracings in dentulous population. Materials and Methods: One-hundred twenty dentulous subjects between age group of 20 - 40 years, free of {{signs and symptoms of}} any temporomandibular diseases were selected. The sagittal condylar guidance was determined by protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> and transferred to a semi-adjustable articulator through a face bow. The condylar guidance angles obtained were tabulated. The sagittal outline of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa were traced on panoramic and lateral cephalogram radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed. This was related to the Frankfurt′s horizontal plane on radiograph to determine the radiographic angle of sagittal condylar guidance. The comparison of protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> was done with the angles obtained by panoramic and lateral cephalogram radiograph tracings. Results: The mean difference between the condylar guidance values obtained using panoramic and lateral cephalogram radiographs was 0. 13 ° and 0. 67 ° on right side and 1. 0 ° and 1. 54 ° on left side with the radiographic values being higher. A Significant positive correlation was observed with P values 0. 001 and 0. 005 in left and right respectively. Conclusion: This study highlighted on the correlation between protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> and the lateral cephalogram radiograph tracings which were more positively related than the panoramic radiograph. The values of lateral cephalogram radiograph tracings are closer as separate radiographs for left and right side were taken, causing the amount and quality of image distortion less.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} sagittal condylar guidance obtained by protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> and panoramic radiograph tracing methods in human dentulous subjects. Materials and Methods: The sagittal condylar guidance was determined in 75 dentulous subjects by protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> using Aluwax through a face bow transfer (HANAU™ Spring Bow, Whip Mix Corporation, USA) to a semi-adjustable articulator (HANAU™ Wide-Vue Articulator, Whip Mix Corporation, USA). In the same subjects, the sagittal outline of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the heights of curvature in the glenoid fossa and the corresponding articular eminence. This was then related to the constructed Frankfurt′s horizontal plane to determine the radiographic angle of sagittal condylar guidance. Results: A strong positive correlation existed between right and left condylar guidance by the protrusive interocclusal method (P 0. 000) and similarly by the radiographic method (P 0. 013). The mean difference between the condylar guidance obtained using both methods were 1. 97 ° for the right side and 3. 18 ° for the left side. This difference between the values by the two methods {{was found to be}} highly significant for the right (P 0. 003) and left side (P 0. 000), respectively. The sagittal condylar guidance obtained from both methods showed a significant positive correlation on right (P 0. 000) and left side (P 0. 015), respectively.

Materials and Methods: Sixty subjects were chosen and equally divided into two age groups of 18 - 25 years and 35 - 44 years. The {{left side of the}} mandibular dental casts was photographed using a digital camera to measure the curve of Spee. The canine cusp, mesiobuccal cusp of the first molar and the distal cusp of the second molar were marked and joined to form an arc. Using AUTOCAD software, the radius for this arc was obtained. A protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> was made using rigid bite registration material to measure the amount of posterior disclusion during edge to edge protrusion. A dial gauge with an accuracy of 1 / 100 of a millimeter was used to measure the distance between the cusp tip indentations at the region of the buccal cusp of the mandibular 2 nd premolar and distobuccal cusp of mandibular 1 st molar. The results obtained were statistically analyzed. Results: The radius of curve of Spee increased nonsignificantly with age. The mean disclusion values measured in premolar and molar region showed a nonsignificant decrease with age.

40|$|Background and Objectives: For {{mounting}} the maxillary cast to articulator, minimum three {{reference points}} not on single line, decide {{the plane to}} which maxillary cast is mounted. Variations exist in condylar guidance when different anterior reference points are used to mount the cast. Type of articulator may have influence on condylar guidance. A clinical study was planned to evaluate the effects of different anterior points of reference and two different articulator systems on condylar guidance. Materials and Methods: Total 15 subjects were selected. Six sets of maxillary casts were obtained. Face bow record was made using orbitale as anterior point of reference and the record {{was transferred to the}} Arcon and Non-Arcon articulator. The second and third mounting on Arcon and Non-Arcon articulator were done using Superior and inferior annular groove on incisal pin of articulator. Protrusive interocclusal records were made for all the subjects. Two lateral cephalograms one in maximum intercuspation and the other in protrusion for left and right side were taken. Anatomic condylar guidance of the subject were obtained from radiograph tracing. Arcon and Non-arcon articulator were programmed with Protrusive <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> of the subjects and the condylar guidance was tabulated for right and left side.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of two types of occlusal accommodation on the arch separation in centric and eccentric arch positions and to assess the opposing tooth contacts in professionally made, thermoformed sports mouthguards. Maxillary and mandibular alginate impressions, a wax <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> of centric occlusion together with maxillary/condylar face-bow registrations, were recorded clinically for 10 undergraduate dental students who are sports activist volunteers of the School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen's University Belfast. Two ethylene vinyl acetate thermoformed maxillary mouthguards were made for each player (N = 20) using a standardised procedure. Ten mouthguards served both as the control (i. e. the non-accommodated) group and also the accommodated, occlusally 'imprinted' group. The other 10 mouthguards served as the accommodated, occlusally 'ground' group. Casts were articulated, each non-accommodated and accommodated mouthguard was seated and the extent of the interocclusal opening was recorded in all three arch relationships. The number of mouthguard and mandibular tooth contacts were also recorded in each position. The increased vertical occlusal dimension that was found in the presence of non-accommodated mouthguards equated to the full-sheet thickness of the material that was used to form the mouthguards. Only mouthguards accommodated by grinding retained high levels of occlusal contact in all arch relationships that were tested. Within the limitations of this study, the modification of the occlusal surface made by flat grinding reduced the arch separation in eccentric movements and increased the opposing tooth contacts in custom-made mouthguards. This may contribute to increased comfort, compliance and the protective effect of these appliances thus resulting in a reduction of injuries to the teeth, arches and soft tissues...|$|E

40|$|The quality {{effect of}} a face-bow on the static {{occlusion}} in connection with an alteration of the vertical dimension. A randomized clinical study. It was {{the purpose of this}} clinical, double-blinded, randomized study to evaluate the benefits of an arbitrary face-bow in the mounting procedure of casts in connection with an alteration of the vertical dimension. The influence of the face-bow concerning the occlusal contact situation as well as the extent of the follow-up had to be examined. The initial number of patients (edentulous, complete dentures) was 32, randomized into two groups with 16 patients. In the face-bow group an arbitrary earpiece face-bow (PROTAR  7 digma, KaVo, Biberach / Riss, Germany) has been used. In the control group the casts were mounted arbitrarily. The alteration of the vertical relationship was achieved by a remount procedure. After lowering the cast the occlusal contacts in both groups were grinded uniformly (no occlusal contacts per front tooth). The number of occlusal contacts was evaluated directly after the remounting procedure and 84 days after. Sore spots on the oral mucosa were documented as well. All complete dentures had been duplicated in the laboratory before the occlusal contacts were grinded. In that way the model casts for one patient could be mounted in both ways (the face-bow transfer was used initially for all subjects regardless of the group membership). After lowering the casts a silicon <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> was made for each pair of casts which was evaluated using the "Greifswald Digital Analyzing System" software (Reader GEDAS 2). The number of clinical occlusal contacts on each anterior and posterior teeth and the number of teeth in contact in both groups were not significantly different at any time (p> 0. 05). The evaluation of the model data for the contacts of the posterior teeth revealed no significant differences (p> 0. 05). The number of anterior tooth contacts (p = 0. 005), the number of anterior teeth in contact (p = 0. 007) and the total number of teeth in contact (p= 0. 027) were significantly higher in the face-bow group. The extent of follow-up was similar in both groups. Based on the present results the earpiece face-bow used in this study for the transfer of complete dentures in the articulator after a previous change in the vertical dimension can be considered to be equivalent to the arbitrarily mounting method and achieved no advantages over the control group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{introduction}} of different interocclusal recording materials has put clinicians in dilemma that which material {{should be used}} in routine clinical practice for precise recording and transferring of accurate existing occlusal records for articulation of patient’s diagnostic or working casts in the fabrication of good satisfactory prosthesis. In the era of developing world of dentistry the different materials are introduced for <b>interocclusal</b> <b>record</b> with different brand names because of this; the utility of the material is confusing for successful delivery of prosthesis with lack of in vitro or in vivo studies which will predict the property of the material with utility recommendations. Purpose of the study The aim of this multicenter research is to evaluate the time dependent linear dimensional stability of three types of interocclusal recording materials; which gives very clear idea to clinicians in regard to its usage in routine practice and recommendations for usage of the different materials. Also to find out ideal time for articulation of three types of interocclusal recording materials with accuracy. Materials and method Commercially available and ADA approved Polyether bite registration paste (Ramitec), Poly vinyl siloxane bite registration paste (Jetbite) and Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) bite registration paste (Super bite) were used in the study. A stainless steel die was made according to modified American dental Associations (ADA) specification no. 19. Each one of the tested materials were manipulated according to manufacturers’ instructions. The materials separated from die, 3 -mins after their respective setting time, resulted in disks of standard diameter. Two parallel lines and three perpendicular lines reproduced on the surface. The distance between two parallel lines was measured at different time intervals i. e. 1 hour, 24, 48 and 72 hours by using travelling microscope (magnus) and compared with standard die measurements made according to ADA specification no. 19 to find out the dimensional stability of these interocclusal recording materials. Total 120 samples were made for observation and results were subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and then Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test for comparison among groups at the 0. 05 level of significance. After statistical analysis of the data, results were obtained and analyzed for interpretation. Results The results shows significant difference between the dimensional stability of all three material at different intervals with p-value Conclusion The dimensional stability decreased with increase in time and is influenced by both material factor and time factor. Polyether was found to be more dimensionally stable interocclusal recording material, which was followed by Silicone and Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE). The dimensional stability of Polyether was good. Zinc oxide eugenol is dimensionally more unstable when compared with polyether and polyvinyl siloxane. We recommend that the polyether interocclusal records must be articulated within 48 hours and Polyvinylsiloxane interocclusal records must be articulated within 24 hours and the ZOE should be articulated within 1 hour to get a correct restoration to have very minimum distortion and maximum satisfaction without failure of prosthesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{determines the}} {{relationship}} between several characteristics of jaw movement and masticatory performance determined by multiple regression analysis and adjusted for occlusal contact area and bite force. Materials and methods. Forty-two young adults with natural dentition participated in this cross-sectional study. Occlusal contact area was determined at the maximum intercuspal position by scanning <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records.</b> Maximum unilateral force was measured {{by means of a}} gnathodynamometer. The height and amplitude of mastication, occlusal glide length, lateral guidance angle, anterior-posterior distance and cycle duration were recorded using the ARCUSdigma II system. Masticatory performance was determined by sieving the Optosil particles resulting from 20 chewing cycles. Results. Median particle size was negatively associated with height of mastication, maximum bite force, occlusal contact area and amplitude of mastication. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the height of mastication and dental guidance angle are the characteristics of jaw movement most closely related to masticatory performance. Conclusions. In adults with natural dentition, a large vertical height of mastication and a small dental guidance angle are the characteristics of jaw movement most closely associated with good masticatory performance, determined by multiple regression analysis and adjusted for occlusal contact area and bite forc...|$|R

Five patients participated for whom vertical movement of denture bases was measured by comparing the thickness of plaster <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> made with the denture at rest and under biting pressure. Denture bases were processed on master casts formed from final impressions made in full arch custom trays. Secondly, bases were readapted using sectional relining impressions with the same regular body polysulfide impression material. Results. Statistical analysis of the vertical movement of denture bases during biting at 4 points on the right and left denture bases showed a significant decrease in vertical movement with sectional impression. The reduction was less than a 0. 1 mm, a result that questions the routine use of sectional impression for every distal-extension mandibular removable partial denture. Conclusion.

40|$|Motivation: Dental {{treatments}} sometimes {{require the}} recording and {{reproduction of the}} patient’s transverse horizontal axis (THA). This is the axis about which the mandible will rotate, when the condyles are fully seated in their glenoid fossae. However, methods for recording this axis are rarely used in general practice, due to expense and perceived lack of efficacy. Problem Statement: A simplified method for accurately recording the THA, and <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> (IORs), is needed for general dentistry. Approach: An optical 3 D scanning method is proposed to kinematically record the THA. A simulation determines the required hardware specifications to build the scanner at minimal cost. The ability to record the hinge axis of a dental articulator is explored. High quality <b>interocclusal</b> optical <b>records</b> are essential, and these are investigated in subsequent experiments. Areas for improvements are identified and efforts are made to enhance the system speed and calibration. Results: Simulation results indicated that all 6 upper and lower anterior teeth, including 2 mm of gingivae should be captured, with an accuracy of 50 µm. The THA on a dental articulator could be located with a radial accuracy of 2. 65 ± 1. 01 mm. The repeatability (precision) of IORs showed {{a standard deviation of}} 22 µm anteriorly, and a mean of 43 µm posteriorly in vitro. The accuracy (trueness and precision) of the IORs was - 15 ± 22 µm anteriorly, and up to - 93 ± 121 µm posteriorly in vitro. A faster scanning protocol enabled in vivo testing. 29 IORs of a single subject took < 2 s to perform. The registrations showed a repeatability of 31 µm anteriorly and 70 µm posteriorly. A novel calibration process produced significantly reduced stereo reprojection errors compared to traditional methods (0. 22 vs 0. 27 pixels), offering a potential future system enhancement. Conclusions: The proposed method shows potential to improve the speed, accuracy and simplicity with which the THA, and interocclusal registration, can be recorded. Further developments have been suggested prior to embarking on clinical trials. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether chewing side preference {{is related to}} handedness and lateral asymmetry of occlusal characteristics, muscular force and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in a dentate population. Design: One hundred and seventeen dentate adults participated in this cross-sectional study. Static and dynamic occlusal characteristics were determined at the maximal intercuspal position and at the lateral excursions by scanning <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records</b> and analysing them using image software. Unilateral maximum bite force and finger-thumb grip force were measured {{by means of a}} gnathodynamometer. TMD were assessed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. Chewing side preference and masticatory laterality were determined by observing the jaw's movement while each subject chewed silicone. Asymmetry or side difference of the variables was calculated. Correlation between side difference variables and masticatory laterality was studied using Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: Fifty-nine subjects chewed on the right, 15 on the left and 43 chewed on both sides. There was no relationship between preferred chewing side and handedness, lateral asymmetry of TMD or side difference in finger-thumb grip force. Significant and positive correlations were observed between masticatory laterality and side differences in bite force and side differences in occlusal contact area at intercuspal position (P< 0. 01). Conclusions: Chewing side preference in a dentate population is related to lateral asymmetry of bite force and asymmetry of occlusal contact area at the intercuspal position but not to handedness...|$|R

Thus, maximum intercuspation might be employed in patients with occlusal stability, {{eliminating the need for}} <b>interocclusal</b> <b>records.</b> This study compared occlusal splints fabricated in {{centric relation}} and maximum intercuspation in muscle pain reduction of TMD patients. Twenty patients with TMD of myogenous origin and bruxism were divided into 2 groups treated with splints in maximum intercuspation (I) or centric relation (II). Clinical, electrognathographic and electromyographic examinations were performed before and 3 months after therapy. Data were analyzed by the Student's t test. Differences at 5 % level of probability were considered statistically significant. There was a remarkable reduction in pain symptomatology, without statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the groups. There was mandibular repositioning during therapy, as demonstrated by the change in occlusal contacts on the splints. Electrognathographic examination demonstrated a significant increase in maximum left lateral movement for group I and right lateral movement for group II (p 0. 05) in the electromyographic activities at rest after utilization of both splints. In conclusion, both occlusal splints were effective for pain control and presented similar action. The results suggest that maximum intercuspation may be used for fabrication of occlusal splints in patients with occlusal stability without large discrepancies between centric relation and maximum intercuspation. Moreover, this technique is simpler and less expensive...|$|R

This was distributed to 230 individual DP's who work in private clinics or primary health care centers in Khartoum state. A total of 152 completed questionnaire forms were collected, giving a response rate of 66. 09 %. The crown and bridge work was mainly done in private practice (80. 92 %) in comparison to primary health care centers (19. 08 %). Thirty two percent and 38. 1 % of the surveyed DP's never or rarely used study casts respectively. The surveyed DP's often (40. 94 %) and rarely (35. 57 %) use radiographs for the crown and bridge work. Vitality test of abutment teeth was never (45. 64 %) or rarely (22. 82 %) done by the majority of the surveyed DP's. High-speed hand pieces were the instrument of choice in 80. 54 % of the responses. The most common used hand pieces according to number of spray ports were found to be the single port (80. 43 %). Impression materials used by surveyed DP's were as follow: additional cured-silicone 7. 32 %, condensationcured silicone 24. 32 % and alginate 68. 24 %. The putty and wash technique was the most recommended technique for those who used silicone impression material (80. 85 %). Impression trays used by DP's were: metal 23. 53 %, rigid plastic 12. 5 % and both 63. 97 %. Results in relation {{to the use of the}} retracting cord indicated that 53. 69 % never use it, while 9. 4 % always used it in their practice. Disinfection of the impression was not routine. Wax was the most commonly used <b>interocclusal</b> <b>recording</b> material (94. 34 %). Both verbal and written prescriptions (81. 73 %) was the most common way of communication between DP's and dental technicians.
