50|$|A clutch <b>delay</b> <b>valve</b> is an {{automotive}} component {{added to}} the clutch system of an automobile to standardize clutch engagement speed. Its purpose is to engage the drive train of an automobile without introducing shock to the drive train components by engaging too quickly. By preventing drive train shock, CDVs also prevent an automobile's balance from being upset, which aids in handling characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate as}} one-way {{restrictor}} valves that limit {{the volume of}} fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm engagement without being too fast for the drive train to handle since clutches can quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. The clutch <b>delay</b> <b>valve</b> slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock {{in the event that}} an inexperienced driver quickly engaged the clutch at higher revs.|$|E
50|$|CBS {{helps to}} reduce the danger of wheel locks and fall downs but in certain {{situations}} {{it is possible that}} CBS causes a fall down. If brake pressure is distributed from the rear wheel to the front wheel and the friction of the surfaces changes suddenly (puddle, ice on the street) the front wheel might lock even if only the rear brake has been applied. This would lead to a loss of stability and a fall down. CBS is therefore combined with ABS to avoid this on a motorcycle.Different approaches are possible to realize this combination:Without active pressure Build upSingle Version: A third additional channel links the rear wheel circuit through a <b>delay</b> <b>valve</b> to the front brake. Strong brake pressure at the rear wheel (or both wheels) pressurises both brake circuits however this pressure is adjusted according to wheel speed and brake slip.|$|E

50|$|Clutch <b>delay</b> <b>valves</b> {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile.

Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage.|$|R
50|$|Honda’s first street {{motorcycle}} with {{a combined}} braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that secondary master cylinder. Braking force was translated into pressure that {{was sent to the}} rear brake cylinder. Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the proportioning and <b>delay</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The BMW M Roadster {{has been}} the BMW Z4 M Roadster {{launched}} in late 2006. Called the M Roadster, it's powered by the same 3.2L, 8,000rpm, S54 inline-6 engine as the E46 series M3, delivering 338hp (slightly less than the E46 M3s 343hp due to the shorter exhaust system), through a new 6-speed [...] "Type H" [...] manual transmission. Engine management however is specific to the Z4M: the Siemens MSS70 with higher processing power (64 million calculations per second) than the MSS54 (25 million CPS) in the M3. Other performance parts borrowed from the M3 include the CSL's compound (aluminum hubs, stainless steel pins, cross drilled iron floating rotors) brakes {{and most of the}} M3's suspension components. Other changes include a hydraulic steering setup which provides better feel than the electric system in standard Z4 models. Weighing 3197 lb (1450 kg), the M Roadster has been tested by major U.S. car magazines to accelerate from Zero-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, which is slightly quicker than the Porsche Boxster S and Porsche Cayman S. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mi/h km/h. A new six-speed manual transmission is used since the M3's original six-speed doesn't fit the Z4's chassis. The six speed is the only transmission available in the M Coupe/Roadster; its final gear ratios are virtually the same as those of the M3. It is reported on owner forums that the 6-speed gearbox in the 2006-2008 M roadsters and coupes is prone to grinding when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear at high rpm. According to reports, there has been mixed response by BMW dealerships to this issue, some owners claiming to have received entirely new gearboxes and others claiming their dealer calls the grinding [...] "normal".

40|$|In this Thesis, the {{development}} and the characterization of polymeric films with {{the ultimate goal of}} switching the properties of functionalized microchannel surfaces is presented. The coatings were mainly based on two types of stimulus responsive polymers, temperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and redox-responsive poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS). These polymers allow one to control wettability, adhesion force, and friction which are important variables for preparing designer microchannels. Surface switching was primarily studied by colloid probe AFM. The motivation for the choice of PNIPAM and PFS is rationalized by their responsiveness and by the opportunities for anchoring these polymers to solid substrates, allowing one to functionalize the inner walls of microfluidic devices and tune the surface properties of these walls to control flow. As a proof of concept, we present a study of PFS functionalized channels for switchable <b>delay</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Existing {{microfluidic}} devices transport fluids by {{a variety}} of physical means. Among them, pump-based and capillary-based fluid delivery systems are commonly adapted to move fluids. The pump-based systems intrinsically require sub systems consisting of mechanical and/or electrical instruments, which poses tremendous difficulties to system-level miniaturization. Herein, the investigations of two capillary-based microfluidic platforms are described. The first platform encapsulates biological reagents by capillary force in carefully designed microchannels, and detects biomolecules by moving magnetic beads in it. The second platform provides functional microfluidic devices made of paper—a fabric and abundant material that autonomously wicks fluids. Chapter 1 describes the development of the polymer-based platform, whereas Chapter 2 and 3 present the paper-based platform. ^ Specifically, Chapter 1 reports a the polymer-based microfluidic device for immuno-diagnostics. Rather than handling fluid reagents against a stationary solid phase, the platform manipulates analyte-coated magnetic beads through stationary plugs of fluid reagents to detect an antigenic analyte. These isolated but accessible plugs are pre-encapsulated in a microchannel by capillary force. We call this platform microfluidic inverse phase enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (μIPELISA). μIPELISA has distinctive advantages in the family of microfluidic immunoassay. In particular, it avoids pumping and valving fluid reagents during assaying, thus leading to a lab-on-a-chip format that is free of instrumentation for fluid actuation and control. We use μIPELISA to detect digoxigenin-labeled DNA segments amplified from E. Coli O 157 :H 7 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and compare its detection capability with that of microplate ELISA. For 0. 259 ng per 2 ̆ 6 mgr;L− 1 of digoxigenin-labeled amplicon, μIPELISA is as responsive as the microplate ELISA. Also, we simultaneously conduct μIPELISA in two parallel microchannels. ^ Chapter 2 reports a fluidic diode, valves and a circuit fabricated entirely on a single layer of paper to control wicking of fluids. Our fluidic diode is a two-terminal component that promotes or stops wicking along a paper channel. We further constructed a trigger valve and a <b>delay</b> <b>valve</b> based on the fluidic diode. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high-level functional circuit, consisted of a diode and a <b>delay</b> <b>valve,</b> to manipulate two fluids in a sequential manner. Our study provides new, transformative tools to manipulate fluid for microfluidic paper-based devices. ^ Chapter 3 reports the 3 D counterparts of the fluidic components described in the previous chapter. By using printing, stacking and taping, we create channels defined by wax contours in multilayer of paper to further reduce the footprints of microfluidic paper-based devices. This fabrication method is simple with a high yield: the channels are ready for assembling in minutes, and the typical turn-round time from a design to an end assembly is less than an hour. We believe these features are attractive for rapid prototyping of microfluidic paper-based devices. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Acute posterolateral left {{ventricular}} ischemia in sheep results in ischemic mitral regurgitation, but {{the effects of}} ischemia in other {{left ventricular}} regions on ischemic mitral regurgitation is unknown. Methods: Six adult sheep had radiopaque markers placed on the left ventricle, mitral annulus, and anterior and posterior mitral leaflets at the valve center and near the anterior and posterior commissures. After 6 to 8 days, animals were studied with biplane videofluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography before and during sequential balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending, distal left circumflex, and proximal left circumflex coronary arteries. Time of valve closure {{was defined as the}} time when the distance between leaflet edge markers reached its minimum plateau, and systolic leaflet edge separation distance was calculated on the basis of left ventricular ejection. Results: Only proximal left circumflex coronary artery occlusion resulted in ischemic mitral regurgitation, which was central and holosystolic. <b>Delayed</b> <b>valve</b> closure (anterior commissure, 58 ± 29 vs 92 ± 24 ms; valve center, 52 ± 26 vs 92 ± 23 ms; posterior commissure, 60 ± 30 vs 94 ± 14 ms; all P <. 05) and increased leaflet edge separation distance during ejection (mean increase, 2. 2 ± 1. 5 mm, 2. 1 ± 1. 9 mm, and 2. 1 ± 1. 5 mm at the anterior commissure, valve center, and posterior commissure, respectively; P <. 05 for all) was seen during proximal left circumflex coronary artery occlusion but not during left anterior descending or distal left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Ischemic mitral regurgitation was associated with a 19 % ± 10 % increase in mitral annular area, and displacement of both papillary muscle tips away from the septal annulus at end systole. Conclusions: Acute ischemic mitral regurgitation in sheep occurred only after proximal left circumflex coronary artery occlusion along with <b>delayed</b> <b>valve</b> closure in early systole and increased leaflet edge separation throughout ejection in all 3 leaflet coaptation sites. The degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction induced did not correlate with ischemic mitral regurgitation, but both altered valvular and subvalvular 3 -dimensional geometry were necessary to produce ischemic mitral regurgitation during acute left ventricular ischemia.

40|$|ObjectivesWith the {{introduction}} of the 31 -mm Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis, patients with large aortic annulus have become eligible for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the 31 -mm Medtronic CoreValve in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and large aortic annulus. MethodsFive institutions in the Netherlands and Italy participated in a retrospective multicenter registry. Clinical, procedural, and imaging data of patients treated with the 31 -mm Medtronic CoreValve were retrospectively collected in accordance with the Valve Academic Research Consortium- 2 criteria. ResultsBetween August 2011 and November 2012, 47 patients (44 men, mean age 77. 6 ± 8. 9 years) received the 31 -mm Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis for severe aortic stenosis. Device success (correct positioning of a single valve with intended performance and no all-cause 30 -day mortality) was achieved in 31 patients (66. 0 %). Reasons for failing the device success criteria were significant prosthetic aortic regurgitation in 3 patients (6. 4 %), second valve implantation in 10 patients (21. 2 %) (8 cases of malpositioning with high-grade aortic regurgitation, 1 acute valve dislocation, and 1 <b>delayed</b> <b>valve</b> dislocation), 1 of whom died intrahospital, and in-hospital mortality in a further 3 patients (6. 4 %).

50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a <b>delayed</b> action <b>valve.</b> The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The <b>delayed</b> action <b>valve</b> slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.|$|R
