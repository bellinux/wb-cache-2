500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, [...] "I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised." [...] Eaton brought his {{crippled}} aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on." ...|$|E

Mr. Bosengate could not resist putting his handkerchief to his nose. He had carefully drenched it with lavender water, and to this fact owed, perhaps, his immunity from the post of foreman on the jury--for, {{say what you will}} about the English, they have a deep instinct for affairs.|$|R

50|$|Cosme Costa {{speaks of}} Goa as a trading centre with the Middle East and with Rome. He {{speaks of the}} Apostle Thomas making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> land <b>to</b> Kerala - {{and it is not}} implausible that he passed through Goa and the Konkan coast. He also {{examines}} the evidence of the Apostle Bartholomew having done {{more or less the same}} thing. Cosme Costa's book contains a ch. 6 dedicated to the examination of Pre-Portuguese references to Christianity in Goa. Ch. 7 examines the vestiges of Pre-Portuguese Christian Customs in Goa and the Konkan. Costa also suggests that the 'Betal' worshipped quite commonly in Goa is a corruption of 'Bartholomew'. Ch. 8, finally, is dedicated to the discovery of the 'Thomas Cross' hidden in a smallish monument, surmounted by a Latin Cross, near the old Goa harbour. A storm seems to have split open the structure, revealing the Thomas Cross within.|$|R
50|$|Båtskaret (The boat pass) is {{a narrow}} pass along Bitihorn where in medieval times people from Øystre Slidre dragged their boats through, {{therefore}} the name. A bit {{further into the}} mountain {{there is a big}} lake called Vinstervatnet with a lot of fine trout. As a result of a dispute between people from Valdres and people from Gudbrandsdal, they could not leave their boats behind. Therefore, they had to resort to dragging their boats through Båtskaret. According to local folklore, the dispute began in medieval times with a young bride being married to an old man and a knight stealing <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> the mountains <b>to</b> rescue her.|$|R

Sinfield's difficult conversion attempt rebounded against the goal post back into the field so Wigan's lead remained 4-16. Only two minutes later, Leeds had made their way back into opposition territory, again keeping the ball alive with deft passing, this time getting it out to right winger Ben Jones-Bishop who barged <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> the try-line <b>to</b> score. Sinfield kicked the conversion successfully, bringing the half-time score to 10-16 in the Warriors' favour.|$|R

60|$|Barnet {{became aware}} of an {{excitement}} in the newspaper kiosks {{at the corners of}} the square. Something very sensational had been flashed upon the transparencies. Forgetting for a moment his penniless condition, he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> a bridge <b>to</b> buy a paper, for in those days the papers, which were printed upon thin sheets of metallic foil, were sold at determinate points by specially licensed purveyors. Half over, he stopped short at a change in the traffic below; and was astonished to see that the police signals were restricting vehicles to the half roadway. When presently he got within sight of the transparencies that had replaced the placards of Victorian times, he read of the Great March of the Unemployed that was already in progress through the West End, and so without expenditure he was able to understand what was coming.|$|R

50|$|Eager to travel, {{not only}} {{on account of his}} desire to stretch his artistic skills and knowledge, but also in order to escape the reality of this marriage, he made other {{arrangements}} for the financial support needed that would allow him to travel. On 3 July, {{a few days after the}} wedding, he began his travels out of the country. Along with Tønnes Christian Bruun de Neergaard, writer, enthusiastic art lover and financial supporter, he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> Germany <b>to</b> Paris. Here he studied under neoclassicist Jacques-Louis David from 1811-1812. He improved his skills in painting the human form, and followed his teacher's admonition to paint after Nature and the Antique in order to find Truth. It was here that he developed a lifelong friendship with Paris roommate, fellow artist Jens Peter Møller, and with engraver Johan Frederik Clemens, Jens Juel's collaborator.After two years he traveled further via Florence to Rome where he continued his studies between 1813-1816. He worked on improving his skills as a history painter, and enjoyed painting smaller studies of the local life and area. He lived there three years among a store group of artists, with Bertel Thorvaldsen as the cultural head. Eckersberg and Thorvaldsen developed a close lasting relationship, and the master served the younger Eckersberg as both loyal friend and advisor. Eckersberg painted one of his best portraits, a portrait of Thorvaldsen, in Rome 1814, which was donated to the Academy of Art. Life in Rome agreed with him, and he was greatly affected by the bright southern light he experienced there. He produced a large body of work during those years, including a number of exceptional landscape studies.|$|R

A confused sound of exclamations went up around the table, while Mrs. Pitkin, pale and calm, read the letter and then passed it to her husband without a word. The bright, fixed color in Diana's face had meanwhile been slowly ebbing away, till, with cheeks and lips pale as ashes, she hastily rose and left the table and went to her room. A strange, new, terrible pain--a sensation like being choked or smothered--a rush of mixed emotions--a fearful sense of some inexorable, unalterable crisis having come of her girlish folly--overwhelmed her. Again she remembered the deep tones of his good-by, and how she had only mocked at his emotion. She sat down and leaned her head on her hands in a tearless, confused sorrow.|$|E

60|$|The Consul's work, however, was severe enough. We find {{from his}} own words, {{in a letter to}} Atticus written in the year but one after his Consulship, 61 B.C., that as Consul he made twelve public addresses. Each of them must have been a work of labor, {{requiring}} a full mastery over the subject in hand, and an arrangement of words very different in their polished perfection from the generality of parliamentary speeches to which we are accustomed. The getting up of his cases must have taken great time. Letters went slowly and at a heavy cost. Writing must have been tedious when that most common was done with a metal point on soft wax. An advocate who was earnest in a case had to do much for himself. We have heard how Cicero made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Sicily, creeping in a little boat through the dangers prepared for him, in order that he might get up the evidence against Verres. In defending Aulus Cluentius when he was Prætor, Cicero must have found the work to have been immense. In preparing the attack upon Catiline it seems that every witness was brought to himself. There were four Catiline speeches made in the year of his Consulship, but in the same year many others were delivered by him. He mentions, as we shall see just now, twelve various speeches made in the year of his Consulship.|$|E
60|$|Some {{three weeks}} later chance had taken me to Vienna, and I sat one evening regaling myself in a humble but {{excellent}} little Gasthaus up in the Wahringer quarter. The appointments were primitive, but the Schnitzel, the beer, and the cheese {{could not have been}} improved on. Good cheer brought good custom, and {{with the exception of one}} small table near the door every place was occupied. Half-way through my meal I happened to glance in the direction of that empty seat, and saw that it was no longer empty. Poring over the bill of fare with the absorbed scrutiny of one who seeks the cheapest among the cheap was Laploshka. Once he looked across at me, with a comprehensive glance at my repast, as though to say, “It is my two francs you are eating,” and then looked swiftly away. Evidently the poor of Monsieur le Curé had been genuine poor. The Schnitzel turned to leather in my mouth, the beer seemed tepid; I left the Emmenthaler untasted. My one idea was to get away from the room, away from the table where that was seated; and as I fled I felt Laploshka’s reproachful eyes watching the amount that I gave to the piccolo—out of his two francs. I lunched next day at an expensive restaurant which I felt sure that the living Laploshka would never have entered on his own account, and I hoped that the dead Laploshka would observe the same barriers. I was not mistaken, but as I came out I found him miserably studying the bill of fare stuck up on the portals. Then he slowly made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a milk-hall.

6000|$|About a {{week after}} this Henry Grantly rode over from Cosby Lodge to Hogglestock. It has been just said that though the assizes had passed by and though all {{question}} of Mr. Crawley's guilt was now set aside, no visitor had of late made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Hogglestock. I fancy that Grace Crawley forgot, in the fulness of her memory as to other things, that Mr. Harding, of whose death she heard, had been her lover's grandfather,--and that therefore there might possibly be some delay. Had there been much said between {{the mother and the}} daughter about the lover, no doubt all this would have been explained; but Grace was very reticent, and there were other matters in the Hogglestock household which in those days occupied Mrs. Crawley's mind. How were they again to begin life? for, in very truth, life as it had existed with them before, had been brought to an end. But Grace remembered well the sort of compact which existed between her and her lover;--the compact which had been made in very words between herself and her lover's father. Complete in her estimation as had been the heaven opened to her by Henry Grantly's offer, she had refused it all,--lest she should bring disgrace upon him. But the disgrace was not certain; and if her father should be made free from it, then,--then,--then Henry Grantly ought to come to her and be at her feet with all the expedition possible to him. That was her reading of the compact. She had once declared, when speaking of the possible disgrace which might attach itself to her family and to her name, that her poverty did not [...] "signify a bit." [...] She was not ashamed of her father,--only of the accusation against her father. Therefore she had hurried home when that accusation was withdrawn, desirous that her lover should tell her of his love,--if he chose to repeat such telling,--amidst all the poor things of Hogglestock, and not among the chairs and tables and good dinners of luxurious Framley. Mrs. Robarts had given a true interpretation to Lady Lufton of the haste which Grace had displayed. But she need not have been in so great a hurry. She had been at home already above a fortnight, and as yet he had made no sign. At last she said a word to her mother. [...] "Might I not ask to go back to Miss Prettyman's now, mamma?" [...] "I think, dear, you had better wait till things are a little settled. Papa is to hear again from the dean very soon. You see they are all in a great sorrow at Barchester about poor Mr. Harding's death." [...] "Grace!" [...] said Jane, rushing into the house almost speechless, at that moment, [...] "here he is!--on horseback." [...] I do not know why Jane should have talked about Major Grantly as simply [...] "he." [...] There had been no conversation among the sisters to justify her in such a mode of speech. Grace had not a moment to put two and two together, so that she might realize the meaning of what her mother had said; but nevertheless, she felt at the moment that the man, coming as he had done now, had come with all commendable speed. How foolish had she been with her wretched impatience! ...|$|E
