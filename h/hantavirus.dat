5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. <b>Hantavirus</b> pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of <b>hantavirus</b> species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one <b>hantavirus</b> species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro virus (OROV) is a {{probable}} species of <b>hantavirus</b> {{found in the}} rodents Oryzomys couesi and Sigmodon mascotensis in the Mexican state of Colima. The former {{is thought to be}} the main host. The sequences of parts of the virus's RNA-based genome have been determined; they differ by 7–10% in amino acid composition and 22–24% in nucleotide composition from closely related viruses.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the <b>hantavirus</b> Sin Nombre virus were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat that was the most common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded <b>hantavirus</b> RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove that the virus fulfilled all the criteria for identifying a new virus species, they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the <b>Hantavirus</b> genus.|$|E
50|$|Asama {{virus is}} genetically closer to other <b>hantaviruses</b> harbored by shrews than by rodents. However, the nucleocapsid protein {{is similar to}} that of rodent and shrew-borne <b>hantaviruses.</b> Phylogenetic {{analyses}} positions it closest to soricine shrew-borne <b>hantaviruses.</b> This suggests a possible host-switching event in the distant past.|$|R

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the natural}} {{reservoir}} of the Bayou virus, {{the second most common}} cause of <b>hantavirus</b> pulmonary syndrome in the United States. Two other hantaviruses, Catacamas virus and Playa de Oro virus, occur in O.couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively, but are not known to infect humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of <b>hantavirus</b> infections in the United States. No <b>hantavirus</b> infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a <b>Hantavirus</b> outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Longitudinal mark-recapture {{studies of}} rodents in two {{sites in the}} Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve in the Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay have {{revealed}} a complex and intriguing pattern of <b>hantaviruses</b> harbored by rodents in this area. Full-length sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were conducted for several rodents from Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys fornesi. The phylogenetic relationships of these viruses were analyzed {{in the context of}} <b>hantaviruses</b> in South America with published S- and M-segment sequences. Findings Phylogenetic analyses of <b>hantaviruses</b> identified in the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve in Paraguay revealed Jabora and Juquitiba viruses are harbored by Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys fornesi, respectively. These analyses revealed that in general the constituents of the major subclade for the S- and M-segments differ for the South American <b>hantaviruses.</b> Further, the two major groups within subclade C for the M-segment reflect in general the lethality associated with the viruses within each group.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of <b>hantaviruses</b> in shrews and bats inWest Africa suggests that other genetically distinct <b>hantaviruses</b> exist in East Africa. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of newfound <b>hantaviruses,</b> detected in archival tissues from the Geata mouse shrew (Myosorex geata) and Kilimanjaro mouse shrew (Myosorex zinki) captured in Tanzania, expands the host diversity and geographic distribution of <b>hantaviruses</b> {{and suggests that}} ancestral shrews and/or bats may have served as the original mamma-lian hosts of primordial <b>hantaviruses.</b> While myriad disease-causing RNA viruses were first discov-ered in sub-Saharan Africa, <b>hantaviruses</b> have been notable exceptions until recently, when Sangassou virus was detected in the African wood mouse (Hylomyscus simus) (1) and Tanganya virus (TGNV) in the Therese’s shrew (Crocidura theresae) (2), captured in Guinea. More recently, genetically distinct hantavi-ruses, designated Azagny virus (AZGV) and Bowé virus (BOWV), {{have been found in}} the West African pygmy shrew (Crocidura obscurior) in Côte d’Ivoire (3) and in the Doucet’s musk shrew (Crocidura douceti) in Guinea (4), respectively.

50|$|Asama {{virus is}} related to soricine shrew-borne <b>hantaviruses</b> that are found in North America, Europe, and Asia. This {{relation}} was discovered through phylogenetic analyses.

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is active during the night, makes nests of sedge and grass, and {{occasionally}} builds runways. Its diverse diet includes plants, fungi, {{and a variety}} of animals. Population densities are usually below 10 per ha (four per acre) and home ranges vary from 0.23 to 0.37ha (0.57 to 0.91acres), depending on sex and geography. Litters of generally three to five young are born after a pregnancy around 25 days, mainly during the summer. Newborns are helpless at birth, but are weaned after a few weeks. Several animals prey on the marsh rice rat, including the barn owl, and it usually lives for less than a year in the wild. It is infected by many different parasites and harbors a <b>hantavirus</b> that also infects humans. The species is not of conservation concern, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of <b>hantavirus</b> infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are {{infected}} and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control {{tested for}} <b>hantavirus</b> even though Asia and Europe {{were the only}} {{documented}} places where <b>hantavirus</b> had been known to occur. No known cases had ever {{been reported in the}} United States. In addition, all the cases in Asia and Europe had involved hantaviruses that caused kidney failure, but never respiratory failure. The testing revealed a previously unknown <b>hantavirus</b> which was eventually named Sin Nombre virus, or No Name virus. The disease became formally known as <b>hantavirus</b> pulmonary syndrome, or HPS.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough <b>hantaviruses</b> {{have been}} {{previously}} considered as rodent-borne pathogens, recent studies demonstrate genetically distinct <b>hantaviruses</b> in evolutionarily distant non-rodent reservoirs, including shrews, moles and bats. The immunological {{responses to these}} newfound <b>hantaviruses</b> in humans are unknown. We compared the innate immune responses to Imjin virus (MJNV) and Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), two shrew-borne <b>hantaviruses,</b> with that toward two rodent-borne <b>hantaviruses,</b> pathogenic Hantann virus (HTNV) and nonpathogenic Prospect Hill virus (PHV). Infection of human macrophages and endothelial cells with either HTNV or MJNV triggered productive viral replication and up-regulation of anti-viral responsive gene expression from day 1 to day 3 postinfection, compared with PHV and TPMV. Furthermore, HTNV, MJNV and TPMV infection led to prolonged increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from days 3 to 7 postinfection. By contrast, PHV infection failed to induce pro-inflammatory responses. Distinct patterns of innate immune activation caused by MJNV suggest {{that it might be}} pathogenic to humans...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hantaviruses</b> are rodent-borne Bunyaviruses that infect the Arvicolinae, Murinae, and Sigmodontinae subfamilies of Muridae. The rate of {{molecular}} {{evolution in the}} <b>hantaviruses</b> has been previously estimated at approximately 10 (- 7) nucleotide substitutions per site, per year (substitutions/site/year), {{based on the assumption}} of codivergence and hence shared divergence times with their rodent hosts. If substantiated, this would make the <b>hantaviruses</b> among the slowest evolving of all RNA viruses. However, as <b>hantaviruses</b> replicate with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with error rates in the region of one mutation per genome replication, this low rate of nucleotide substitution is anomalous. Here, we use a Bayesian coalescent approach to estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution from serially sampled gene sequence data for <b>hantaviruses</b> known to infect each of the 3 rodent subfamilies: Araraquara virus (Sigmodontinae), Dobrava virus (Murinae), Puumala virus (Arvicolinae), and Tula virus (Arvicolinae). Our results reveal that <b>hantaviruses</b> exhibit shortterm substitution rates of 10 (- 2) to 10 (- 4) substitutions/site/year and so are within the range exhibited by other RNA viruses. The disparity between this substitution rate and that estimated assuming rodent-hantavirus codivergence suggests that the codivergence hypothesis may need to be reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hantaviruses</b> {{are members}} of the Bunyaviridae family carried by small mammals and causing human hemorrhagic fevers worldwide. In Western Africa, where a variety of hemorrhagic fever viruses occurs, {{indigenous}} <b>hantaviruses</b> have been molecularly found in animal reservoirs such as rodents, shrews, and bats since 2006. To investigate the human contact to <b>hantaviruses</b> carried by these hosts and to assess the public health relevance of <b>hantaviruses</b> for humans living in the tropical rainforest regions of Western and Central Africa, we performed a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the region of Taï National Park in Côte d´Ivoire and the Bandundu region near the Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Serum samples were initially screened with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using nucleoproteins of several <b>hantaviruses</b> as diagnostic antigens. Positive results were confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence testing. Seroprevalence rates of 3. 9 % (27 / 687) and 2. 4 % (7 / 295), respectively, were found in the investigated regions in Côte d´Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Côte d´Ivoire, this value was significantly higher than the seroprevalence rates previously reported from the neighboring country Guinea as well as from South Africa. Our study indicates an exposure of humans to <b>hantaviruses</b> in West and Central African tropical rainforest areas. In order to pinpoint the possible existence and frequency of clinical disease caused by <b>hantaviruses</b> in this region of the world, systematic investigations of patients with fever and renal or respiratory symptoms are required...|$|R
25|$|Noting symptom {{overlap with}} <b>hantavirus</b> {{pulmonary}} syndrome, several scientists proposed an unknown <b>hantavirus</b> as the cause.

25|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{inconsistencies}} {{in the theory of}} coevolution, Ramsden et al.

Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders Rodentia and Soricomorpha, Yanagihara et al.
