The protons can return to the matrix through the ATP synthase complex, and their potential energy is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate</b> (Pi). This process is called chemiosmosis, and was first described by Peter Mitchell who was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work. Later, part of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker for their clarification of the working mechanism of ATP synthase.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate</b> to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates.

30|$|Niu et al. [28] {{investigated}} {{the impacts of}} four <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates</b> on the thermodynamic, pasting and noodle-making properties of whole wheat flour. The Results showed that the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of melting of starch in whole wheat flour were increased {{with the addition of}} phosphates. All phosphates significantly increased peak viscosity and final viscosity of whole wheat flour. Moreover, the whole wheat noodles incorporated with disodium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, and STPP showed brighter appearance, and the use of STPP and SHMP reduced the cooking loss of whole wheat noodles. Texture profile analysis of cooked noodles indicated that adding phosphates significantly decreased the firmness, while the springiness, cohesiveness, and resilience were slightly reduced. The microstructure of whole wheat noodles showed a close connectivity of the protein network and coverage of starch granules in the presence of <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates.</b> The results suggested that <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates</b> exhibited substantial effects on enhancing the quality of whole wheat noodles.

5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E
5|$|This ring {{structure}} {{is very similar}} to that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase. In bacteria, the protein RNase PH, which is involved in tRNA processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms, two RNase PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor. In bacteria, a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar six-membered ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits. The RNase PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases, meaning that they use <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate</b> to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA molecules.|$|E

This study investigates {{the relationship between}} the modifications in skeletal muscle metabolism and the modification in VO 2 peak induced by a standard program of physical training following a {{myocardial infarction}}. METHODS: Seventeen patients (14 male, 3 female) were studied by phosphorus 31 (31 P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy after the acute phase of a myocardial infarction and after 2 months of rehabilitation. Changes in calf muscle pH, phosphocreatine, and <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates</b> were measured at rest and during a plantar flexion-type incremental workload protocol. Calf muscle pH, phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine + <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates),</b> and <b>inorganic</b> phosphates/phosphocreatine ratios were compared at the highest identical workload attained in both studies. The VO 2 peak (mL/kg/min) was determined during a cycle stress test. RESULTS: At the highest identical workload attained in both tests, the ratio phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine + <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates)</b> was significantly higher (0. 48 +/- 0. 15 to 0. 57 +/- 0. 18 : P <. 001), and the ratio inorganic phosphates/phosphocreatine was lower (1. 38 +/- 1. 14 to 0. 99 +/- 0. 87 : P <. 01). After rehabilitation, no difference was observed for the pH at stress (6. 83 +/- 0. 16 to 6. 91 +/- 0. 14 : not significant [NS]). The increase in the VO 2 peak was significant after rehabilitation (24 +/- 9 to 29 +/- 11 mL/kg/min: P <. 001). The VO 2 peak improvement induced by the physical training was correlated with the increase in the phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine + <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates)</b> (r = 0. 818, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in phosphocreatine depletion indicated that the oxidative capacity of the skeletal muscle was improved during the rehabilitation.

In order {{to test the hypothesis}} that K 2 HPO 4 Could influence the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) by a mecanism which was not DPG mediated we have measured the total ODC on whole blood with and without addition of 13 - 80 mmol/l of <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates.</b> On average, the level of DPG remained unchanged when the P 50 with K 2 HPO 4 was significantly higher (p > 0. 001) (P 50 = 29. 9 +/- 3. 7 mmHg) than when phosphates were not administered (P 50 = 25. 5 +/- 2. 8 mmHg). The relationship between P 50 (mmHg) and K 2 HPO 4 (= X mmol/l) was DELTA-P 50 = - 2. 97 10 (- 3) (X) 2 + 0. 26 (X) - 0. 42 (r = 0. 78). Seeing that phosphates have an immediate action on the ODC, we calculated in our ketoacidosis patients, the relationship between the P 50, the <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphates</b> (P(i) in mg%) and the DPG in mu-mol/gHb.

Cardiac-gated 31 P-NMR spectra were obtained with a regional surface coll over the ischemic area during baseline, occlusion, reperfusion, and reocclusion conditions. Phosphocreatine fell with both the initial and second ischemic insults to 65 % +/- 5 % of baseline for the first occlusion (p p = 0. 07), with normal levels reattained in the intervening period of reperfusion (99 % +/- 5 % of baseline, p = NS).

Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate</b> ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct.

25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are active}} transporters, that is, they require {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to translocate substrates across cell membranes. These proteins harness the energy of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to drive conformational changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and consequently transports molecules. Both ABC importers and exporters have a common mechanism in transporting substrates because of the similarities in their structures. The mechanism that describes the conformational changes associated with binding of substrate is the alternating-access model. In this model, the substrate binding site alternates between outward- and inward-facing conformations. The relative binding affinities of the two conformations for the substrate largely determines the net direction of transport. For importers, since translocation is directed from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, then the outward-facing conformation will have higher binding affinity for substrate. In contrast, the substrate binding affinity in exporters will be greater in the inward-facing conformation. A model that describes the conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis is the ATP-switch model. This model presents two principal conformations of the NBDs: formation of a closed dimer upon binding two ATP molecules and dissociation to an open dimer facilitated by ATP hydrolysis and release of <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphate</b> (Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Switching between the open and closed dimer conformations induces conformational changes in the TMD resulting in substrate translocation.|$|E
