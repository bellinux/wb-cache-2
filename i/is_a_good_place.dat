5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness {{in the first few}} days. Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest suspension bridge (Punakha Suspension Bridge) and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E

Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house finches, and others. Occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ducks, geese and swans is {{greatest}} in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes {{with a rare}} lesser white-fronted goose amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to see the elusive water rail.|$|E

5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E

500|$|School Library Journal {{recommended}} {{the book for}} young readers, and commented, [...] "Teens growing up with the Net aren't likely {{to find a better}} roadmap to the issues affecting their First Amendment future there than this book." [...] The New York Times Book Review was critical of Godwin's writing style in the book, and observed, [...] "He writes in a strong, piercing voice that probably does wonders in a courtroom, but comes off increasingly shrill over several hundred pages of commentary, and at one point fairly warns his reader, 'Subtlety isn't my strong point.'" [...] The Journal of Information Ethics wrote, [...] "This is less an analytic study than a personal survey of situations or occurrences articulated in an informal, colloquial, and anecdotal fashion. It is not aimed at the intelligentsia or legal profession, although members of these groups would certainly benefit from the details." [...] The review concluded, [...] "The details are sometimes overwhelming, but for those who wish to know everything, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to start." ...|$|E

500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 92, based on 14 reviews. It was {{called one of}} Cooder's best records by Uncut magazine's Nigel Williamson and Martin Chilton of The Daily Telegraph. AllMusic editor Thom Jurek deemed it Cooder's [...] "most overtly political album ... {{and one of his}} funniest, most musically compelling ones, too", while Daniel Paton from musicOMH said much of the record was [...] "highly satisfying satire (although also often sensitive and affecting), combining Cooder’s transparent love {{for a wide range of}} roots music with his engagement with politics." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was impressed by how Cooder used similar characters throughout the songs in new ways, calling the album his best since 2005's Chávez Ravine. Cooder received comparisons to Woody Guthrie in reviews written by Phil Sutcliffe of Mojo, who found the lyrics sharply written, and Neil Spencer from The Observer, who called Cooder [...] "a Woody Guthrie for our times" [...] and the record [...] "a fierce state-of-the-nation album". In the opinion of PopMatters critic Philip Majorins, the record would not have a significant impact because of the public's predominantly commercial tastes and a [...] "cynical" [...] cultural climate, but concluded, [...] "Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down could have tremendous cathartic power for [...] who are aware of history and its knack for repeating itself. For those who are willing, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to start an education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not surprisingly, Muir's {{deep-seated}} {{feeling about}} nature as being his true home led to tension {{with his family}} {{at his home in}} Martinez, California. He once told a visitor to his ranch there, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to be housed in during stormy weather, [...] [...] [...] to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not my home.

2500|$|In May 1810, a fire {{broke out}} in Bratslav, {{destroying}} Rebbe Nachman's home. A group of maskilim (Jews belonging to the secular Haskalah [...] movement) living in Uman invited him to live in their town, and provided housing for him as his illness worsened. Many years before, Rebbe Nachman had passed through Uman and told his disciples, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to be buried." [...] He {{was referring to the}} cemetery where 2000 (or by some accounts as many as 20,000) Jewish martyrs of the Haidamak Massacre of Uman of 1768 were buried.

2500|$|Because {{of a lack}} of good access paths {{from the}} south (Glen Falloch), Ben Oss is usually climbed from the area just south of Tyndrum, with the usual start being at Dalrigh (grid {{reference}} [...] ) on the A82 road. Many guide books recommend climbing Ben Oss with Beinn Dubhchraig from Dalrigh and this allows for a less steep approach over Dubhchraig and then continuing to Ben Oss via the Bealach Buidhe. A circular walk around the head of the Cononish valley can be continued over Ben Lui and Beinn Chuirn to finish again at Dalrigh. The summit of the mountain is flattish and the medium size cairn stands on an area of large slabby rocks interspersed with grass. The summit has a prominence of 342 metres and gives a fine vista of the southern highlands, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to admire the craggy eastern face of neighbouring Ben Lui.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Yale {{sought to}} recruit Fitzpatrick to return {{once again to}} that school.

[...] And without Fitzpatrick, Yost could not produce the winning football teams he does." [...] A team from Yale visited Fitzpatrick in June 1905 but left Ann Arbor with the report that it was [...] "impossible to get Keene away from Michigan." [...] It was said: [...] "Keene is located there, with everything pleasant and just as he wants it, and they say they won't let him go and he says he can't come.

2500|$|Black Eagle Dam is also {{utilized}} as {{a recreation}} area.

In mid-July, the River's Edge Trail Luminaria Walk occurs around Black Eagle Dam and the falls, and are illuminated with colored spotlights during the event.
