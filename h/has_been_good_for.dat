Croll also felt the colt needed a rest after a demanding season. [...] "You could give me a half-million dollars tax-free and I wouldn't run him in the Breeders' Cup," [...] he said.

2500|$|This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> {{the source}} {{countries}} of immigrants to Canada, {{but not for}} Canada. For many years, expanded markets for trade has been a common rationale and justification for high immigration from the developing world. However, 2014 data from Statistics Canada reveals that the trade balances with countries from which Canada receives most of its immigrants deteriorates as more immigrants arrive. Total bilateral trade increases, but {{to the detriment of}} Canada. Current data, 2014, shows that only India has balanced trade with Canada: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Being over to Mis Minot's so much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her, {{and up to}} Mis Grant's. Girls catch neat ways {{as quick}} as they do untidy ones, and them wild little tykes often turn out smart women." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her tone {{seemed to}} {{challenge}} further speech, and presently I found words again: [...] "It was an impossible dream, {{almost from the}} beginning; but I awakened to the reality long ago. Still, nothing can rob me of the satisfaction of having known your sister and you, and your influence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me.

6000|$|... "If God wills," [...] {{returned}} Jeff, softly; [...] "I am in His hands, {{and willing}} to be what He chooses. You remember, David, the talk we once had about Miss Millet's argument, that God brings good out of evil. I didn't believe it then; I believe it now.

6000|$|As to her father, Margaret was at rest. He {{had much}} more calmness than when he was more new to grief, and could bear far more patiently and {{hopefully}} than at first. He lived more on his affections above, and much as he loved those below, he did not rest in them as once, and could better afford to have been removed.

60|$|Luckily plain {{work in the}} school-room had {{not gone}} out in our day, and I could make and mend respectably, but I had to keep a volume of Shakespeare, Scott, or Wordsworth open before me, and learn it by heart, to keep away thoughts, which might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me; but no--they were working on their own bitterness.|$|R
