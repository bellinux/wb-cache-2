5|$|Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to <b>Jasmine</b> brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. <b>Jasmine</b> also brought rainfall to {{areas of the}} Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from <b>Jasmine</b> destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular {{are affected by the}} cyclone. <b>Jasmine</b> inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name <b>Jasmine</b> was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|During its existence, {{parts of}} Queensland, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga were {{affected}} by Cyclone <b>Jasmine.</b> The name <b>Jasmine</b> was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names after the season by the World Meteorological Organization, {{and was replaced by}} the name Jenna.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>Jasmine</b> did not {{maintain}} its peak intensity {{for an extended}} period of time. By 9February, the cloud tops surrounding <b>Jasmine</b> began to warm, and thus weakened. In addition, the cyclone began to enter cooler SSTs. Although Jasmine's convective bands continued to thin out, the cyclone maintained a gradually expanding eyewall and remained a compact system. By 10February, the eyewall of Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> measured 95km (60mi) in diameter. The next day, the subtropical ridge that had been forcing <b>Jasmine</b> toward the southeast had weakened, and as a result the cyclone began to track east-northeast, toward a weakness in the ridge. The storm continued to disorganize, with its eye later becoming cloud–filled. By the end of 11February, <b>Jasmine</b> had already weakened to a cyclone with wind speeds of just 85km/h (50mph), sustained for one minute, due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. The low–level circulation center of <b>Jasmine</b> became partly exposed for a period of time on 12February, before convection redeveloped over the center. As a weakening cyclone, <b>Jasmine</b> only maintained an area of weak convection displaced to its east as it approached Tonga.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a {{powerful}} and long-lived annular tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and <b>Jasmine</b> began to strengthen at a faster rate. Steadily intensifying, <b>Jasmine</b> reached peak intensity on 8February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} <b>Jasmine</b> entered {{an area of}} {{vertical}} wind shear, which consequently weakened the cyclone and caused its eye to expand. A high-pressure area south of <b>Jasmine</b> later steered the weakening cyclone to the northeast on 12February. Although it entered an area of warmer sea surface temperatures, <b>Jasmine</b> subsequently entered extratropical transition and later degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on 16February, and later dissipated completely on 19February.|$|E
5|$|Tracking eastward, <b>Jasmine</b> {{entered a}} flow of dry air, which {{prevented}} the storm from strengthening quickly at the time. On 5 February, the low–level atmospheric circulation center of <b>Jasmine</b> became exposed due {{to the presence of}} strong vertical wind shear. However, the cyclone was able to maintain its intensity due to the existence of an area of moisture over Australia. Throughout the rest of the day, the wind shear subdued, and the system began to organize as convective banding wrapped around the center. As a result, Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> intensified into the equivalent of a Category2 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, with winds of 95km/h (60mph), sustained for 10minutes. The next day, Cyclone <b>Jasmine</b> began to track to the east-southeast in response to a strengthening subtropical ridge. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify as convection continued to wrap tightly around the center of <b>Jasmine.</b> At the same time, the storm moved out of the BOM's area of responsibility and into the area of responsibility of the Fiji Meteorological Service's (FMS) tropical cyclone warning center at Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi).|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of Aladdin, <b>Jasmine</b> appears in the film's two direct-to-video sequels, in both of which Larkin reprises her role as the character, with Liz Callaway {{replacing}} Salonga as her singing voice. The first, The Return of Jafar (1994), features <b>Jasmine</b> as she begins to question her trust in Aladdin after he defends Jafar's former pet parrot, Iago, who escapes Jafar's lamp and rescues Aladdin from bandits, hoping to make amends with the royal family. However, Iago manages to convince the princess that she still very much trusts Aladdin. <b>Jasmine</b> eventually befriends Iago after he helps mend her and Aladdin's relationship, frees the Genie, and ultimately risks his life to defeat Jafar, who has returned seeking vengeance. In the second, Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), Jasmine's long-awaited wedding to Aladdin is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. The Oracle, which the thieves are attempting to steal, reveals that Aladdin's father Cassim is still alive and their leader. Encouraging Aladdin to pursue his father, <b>Jasmine</b> agrees to postpone the wedding but can't help but worry for him during his absence. When Aladdin finally returns to Agrabah with Cassim and introduces him, <b>Jasmine</b> and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, Cassim is soon imprisoned by the Sultan after he attempts to steal the Oracle again. Aladdin frees Cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until <b>Jasmine</b> convinces her father {{that he was only}} helping is father out of love. Iago returns to inform them that Cassim has been captured by Sa'luk and the remaining Thieves. <b>Jasmine</b> goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They go for a ride on Carpet, waving good-bye to the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as they ride off. <b>Jasmine</b> appears in the animated television series based on the film, which originally aired from 1994 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, <b>Jasmine</b> rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, <b>Jasmine</b> {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the north-northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, <b>Jasmine</b> began to show characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E

However, they escape {{and return to the}} palace. There, Jafar wishes Genie for his final wish to make <b>Jasmine</b> fall in love with him, but the Genie refuses to grant the wish. Upon noticing Aladdin, <b>Jasmine</b> pretends to be interested to distract Jafar and Aladdin tries to retrieve the lamp, but Jafar stops Aladdin and traps <b>Jasmine</b> inside an hourglass. Jafar transforms into a giant cobra and tells Aladdin that he is the most powerful being in the world. However, Aladdin replies that the Genie is more powerful than him.
