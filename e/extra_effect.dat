[...] However, Martin felt that the audience were only just starting to like Vera because she hadn't had much of a presence in the series. He referred to her as [...] "setting some sort of record for shortest survival period of a Torchwood team-member." [...] io9's Charlie Jane Anders remarked that Vera's death was a [...] "scene of almost unbearable horror, laced with irony", praising the juxtaposition of Oswald's [...] "ludicrous pronouncement that this is a transformation akin to the leap from animals to humans 50,000 years ago" [...] alongside Vera's fate showing [...] "we're all destined to burn."

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of reputation, an inchoate indicator of regard by one’s peers. The essential questions are: 1) Does the quantity of exposures affect reputation independent of their quality? and 2) Assuming that their overall quality matters for reputation, does the quality of an individual’s most important exposure have an <b>extra</b> <b>effect</b> on reputation? Using a variety of evidence for academic economists, {{we find that the}} quantity of output has no impact on reputation, but some evidence that the importance of their most influential work enhances their reputation beyond its effect through a measure of overall quality. Quality rankings matter more than measures of absolute quality. Data on salaries show, on the contrary, substantial positive effects of quantity, independent of quality, and little <b>extra</b> <b>effect</b> of the most influential work. Overall the results suggest that in the market for reputation one may be judged disproportionately by quality, particularly of one's best-known work, but that salary is determined in ways different from reputation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{examine the}} effect of heat waves on mortality, over and above what would be {{predicted}} on the basis of temperature alone. Methods Present modeling approaches may not fully capture <b>extra</b> <b>effects</b> relating to heat wave duration, possibly because the mechanisms of action and the population at risk are different under more extreme conditions. Modeling such <b>extra</b> <b>effects</b> can be achieved using the commonly left-out effect-modification between the lags of temperature in distributed lag models. Results Using data from Stockholm, Sweden, and a variety of modeling approaches, we found that heat wave effects amount to a stable and statistically significant 8. 1 - 11. 6 % increase in excess deaths per heat wave day. The effects explicitly relating to heat wave duration (2. 0 – 3. 9 % excess deaths per day) were more sensitive to the degrees of freedom allowed for in the overall temperature-mortality relationship. However, allowing for {{a very large number of}} degrees of freedom indicated over-fitting the overall temperature-mortality relationship. Conclusions Modeling additional heat wave effects, e. g. between lag effect-modification, can give a better description of the effects from extreme temperatures, particularly in the non-elderly population. We speculate that it is biologically plausible to differentiate effects from heat and heat wave duration. </p...|$|R
