2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would <b>disconnect</b> <b>power</b> from all the protected circuits.|$|E

40|$|T~e {{following}} {{general safety}} precautions must be observed during {{all phases of}} op-eration, service, and repair of this instrument. Failure to comply with these pre-cautions or with specific warnings given elsewhere in this manual violates safety standards of design, manufacture, and intended use of the instrument. Hewlett-Packard Company e. ssumes no liability for the customer's failure to comply with these requirements. GROUND THE INSTRUMENT To minimize shock hazard, the instrument chassis and cabinet must be connected to an electrical ground. The instrument {{is equipped with a}} three-conductor ac power cable. The power cable must either be plugged into an approved three-contact electrical outlet or used with a three-contact to two-contact adapter with the grounding wire (green) firmly connected to an electrical ground (safety ground) at the power outlet. The power jack and the mating plug of the power cable meet International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) safety standards. DO NOT OPERATE IN AN EXPLOSlVE ATMOSPHERE Do not operate the instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Op-eration of any electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety hazard. KEEP AWAY FROM LIVE CIRCUITS Operating personnel must not remove instrument covers. Component replacement and internal adjustments must be made by qualified maintenance personnel. Do not replace components with power cable connected. Under certain conditions, dan-gerous voltages may exist even with the power cable removed. To avoid injuries, always <b>disconnect</b> <b>power</b> and discharge circuits before touching them. DO NOT SERVICE OR ADJUST ALONE Do not attempt internal service or adjustment unless another person, capable of rendering first aid and resuscitation, is present. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE PARTS OR MODIFY INSTRUMENT Because of the danger of introducing additional hazards, do not install substitute parts or perform any unauthorized modification to the instrument.

40|$|A circuit {{topology}} {{has been}} designed to guarantee the output of intrinsically safe power for the operation of electrical devices in a hazardous environment. This design uses a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) as a switch to connect and <b>disconnect</b> <b>power</b> to a load. A test current is provided through a separate path to the load for monitoring by a comparator against a preset threshold level. The circuit is configured so that the test current will detect a fault in the load and open the switch before the main current can respond. The main current passes through the switch and then an inductor. When a fault occurs in the load, the current through the inductor cannot change immediately, but the voltage drops immediately to safe levels. The comparator detects this drop and opens the switch before the current in the inductor has a chance to respond. This circuit protects both the current and voltage from exceeding safe levels. Typically, this type of protection is accomplished by a fuse or a circuit breaker, but in order for a fuse or a circuit breaker to blow or trip, the current must exceed the safe levels momentarily, which may be just enough time to ignite anything in a hazardous environment. To prevent this from happening, a fuse is typically current-limited by the addition of the resistor to keep the current within safe levels while the fuse reacts. The use of a resistor is acceptable for non-battery applications where the wasted energy and voltage drop across the resistor can be tolerated. The use of the switch and inductor minimizes the wasted energy. For example, a circuit runs from a 3. 6 -V battery that must be current-limited to 200 mA. If the circuit normally draws 10 mA, then an 18 -ohm resistor would drop 180 mV during normal operation, while a typical switch (0. 02 ohm) and inductor (0. 97 ohm) would only drop 9. 9 mV. From a power standpoint, the current-limiting resistor protection circuit wastes about 18 times more power than the switch and the inductor configuration. In the fault condition, both the resistor and the inductor react immediately. The resistor reacts by allowing more current to flow and dropping the voltage. Initially, the inductor reacts by dropping the voltage, and then by not allowing the current to change. When the comparator detects the drop in voltage, it opens the switch, thus preventing any further current flow. The inductor alone is not sufficient protection, because after the voltage drop has settled, the inductor would then allow the current to change, in this example, the current would be 3. 7 A. In the fault condition, the resistor is flowing 200 mA until the fuse blows (anywhere from 1 ms to 100 s), while the switch and inductor combination is flowing about 2 A test current while monitoring for the fault to be corrected. Finally, as an additional safety feature, the circuit can be configured to hold the switch opened until both the load and source are disconnected...|$|E

25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, <b>disconnects</b> <b>power</b> to the latch and allows the door to swing outward.

50|$|In a load/unload control scheme, the {{compressor}} remains continuously powered. However, when {{the demand for}} compressed air is satisfied or reduced, instead of <b>disconnecting</b> <b>power</b> to {{the compressor}}, a device known as a slide valve is activated. This device uncovers part of the rotor and proportionately reduces capacity of the machine down to typically 25% of the compressors capability, thereby unloading the compressor. This reduces the number of start/stop cycles for electric motors over a start/stop control scheme in electrically-driven compressors, improving equipment service life with a minimal change in operating cost. This scheme is utilised by nearly all industrial air-compressor manufacturers. When a load/unload control scheme is combined with a timer to stop the compressor after a predetermined period of continuously unloaded operation, it {{is known as a}} dual-control or auto-dual scheme.|$|R
