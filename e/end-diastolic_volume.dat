5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (<b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volume).</b> Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Continuous positive-pressure {{ventilation}} (CPPV) decreases {{cardiac output}} by decreasing {{right and left}} ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes.</b> To investigate the mechanism(s), we measured cardio-vascular responses to CPPV before and after opening the chest and holding the lungs away from the heart. Expiratory pressure was adjusted to achieve similar lung volumes when the chest was open and closed (12 cm H 2 O). Increasing expiratory pressure, when the chest was closed and evacuated, decreased cardiac output, ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> and transmural ventricular end-diastolic pressures measured relative to lateral and posterior epicardial surface pressure (P< 0. 05). Transmural ventricular end-diastolic pressures measured relative to lateral pleural surface pressure did not change signifi-cantly, indicating {{that the increase in}} thoracic pressure was greater at the lateral and posterior epicardial surfaces than at the lateral pleural surface. Opening the chest and holding the lungs away from the heart eliminated the decrease in cardiac output and ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes</b> during increased expiratory pressure. Pericardectomy did not affect the cardiovascular responses to increased expiratory pressure. We, therefore, conclude that decreased cardiac output and ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes</b> during CPPV result from the effects of increased thoracic pressure on cardiac filling.

50|$|This is a {{narrowing}} of the mitral valve orifice when the valve is open. Mitral stenosis impairs LV filling {{so that there}} is a decrease in <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volume</b> (preload). This leads to a decrease in stroke volume by the Frank-Starling mechanism and a fall in cardiac output and aortic pressure. This reduction in afterload (in particular, aortic diastolic pressure) enables the end-systolic volume to decrease slightly but not enough to overcome the decline in <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volume.</b> Therefore, because <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volume</b> decreases more than end-systolic volume decreases, the stroke volume decreases.|$|E

We derived measures of contractility (the slope [end‐systolic elastance] and the volume intercept of the end‐systolic pressure–volume relationship, stroke work, and preload recruitable stroke work), measures of arterial load and ventricular–arterial coupling, and measures of chamber size (volume intercept, end‐systolic and <b>end‐diastolic</b> <b>volumes).</b> At 6 and 12 months, cardiac resynchronization therapy {{was associated with a}} reduction in the volume intercept and end‐systolic and <b>end‐diastolic</b> <b>volumes</b> (P 0. 01).

40|$|SUMMARY Although the resting hemodynamic {{effects of}} {{captopril}} in {{congestive heart failure}} are known, little information is available about the hemodynamic response to captopril during exercise or about changes in noninvasive measurements of the size and function of both ventricles. In this study, 14 stable New York Heart Association class III patients were given 25 mg of oral captopril. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measure-ments and blood pool scintigrams were performed simultaneously before and 90 minutes after captopril. The radionuclide studies were analyzed for left and right ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> end-systolic volumes, ejection fractions and pulmonary blood volume. The primary beneficial responses at rest were decreases in left and right ventricular <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes</b> from 388 ± 81 to 350 ± 77 ml (p < 0. 01) and from 52 ± 26 to 43 ± 20 volume units (p < 0. 01), respectively, and in their corresponding filling pressures, from 24 ± 10 to 17 ± 9 mm Hg and 10 ± 5 to 6 ± 5 mm Hg (both p < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} {{of the limits of}} {{reversibility}} of left ventricular function after aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation, measurements were made of pre- and postoperative coronary blood Row and left ventricular volumes. Eighteen patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for pure aortic regurgitation using the Björk-Shiley valve or the Bicerval valve were restarted an average of 8 ± 3 months after surgery. Postoperative left ventricular end-systolic and <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes</b> returned to near normal values. The slight left ventricular wall thickening apparent before surgery remained unchanged after surgery and, consequently, left ventricular mass, though somewhat reduced, remained abnormally high. Ejection fraction, which was low preoperatively, returned to normal postoperatively. Total coronary sinus blood flow decreased after surgery, but coronary sinus blood flow per 100 g of left ventricular mass increased. This recovery of coronary flow per unit mass was believed to cause the improvement in left ventricular function. A significant correlation was found between postoperative systolic function and preoperative left ventricular endsystolic and <b>end-diastolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> wall thickness and, especially, left ventricular mass, the latter indicating that, if preoperative left ventricular mass is 35 ml/min before surgery, a postoperative improvement in systolic function to within the normal range may be expected...|$|R

The static program accurately estimates {{the distance from the}} radiation source to the collimator surface (r = 0. 99). Radionuclide count methods best predict “phantom” volumes using attenuation coefficients between 0. 11 − 1 and 0. 13 − 1 cm.
