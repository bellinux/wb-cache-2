The solubilization of cysteine-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase by deoxy-BIGCHAP [N,N'-bis-(3 -D-gluconamidopropyl) deoxycholamide] was the prerequisite for partial purification by means of anion-exchange chromatography.

In thin section analysis, the protein is frequently observed as parallel tracks of electron-dense particles bordering a translucent core. We suggest that the basic unit of the junctional structure is a dimer of 300 -kD subunits and that four such entities constitute the intact SP. The purified protein has been used to develop polyclonal antibodies. By immunoelectron microscopy using immunogold probes, the SP has been localized to the junctional gap of the triad.

Thrombin cleavage of the A- and B-peptides from fibrinogen in vitro was monitored by the appearance of N-terminal glycine, and an increase in glycine was shown in the FR antigen of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. As plasmin progressively degraded fibrinogen, increases in N-terminal alanine, aspartic acid and lysine were observed, corresponding to the known plasmin-cleavage points of fibrinogen; increases in these N-terminal amino acids were also found in the patients' FR antigen. Thrombin treatment in vitro was used to remove fibrinopeptide A (N-terminal alanine) from the samples and to reflect specifically the N-terminal alanine at the plasmin-cleavage point (Arg- 42 -Ala- 43) of the B beta-chain on assay; this alanine was increased progressively in the FR antigen of a patient during urokinase therapy, and was high in other patients when the FR antigen was examined by this procedure...|$|E

The conformation-dependent epitopes on the glycoprotein (G) of rabies virus (RV) {{is responsible for the}} induction of virus neutralizing antibodies which is ultimately required to get complete protection from viral challenge. Therefore, a suitable chromatography technique is necessary to purify the tag free recombinant rabies virus glycoprotein (rRVG) without altering its immunogenic epitopes. The present study was undertaken to purify the rRVG using a conformational specific anti-rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) mAb, M 5 B 4, which binds to the natively folded G. The mAb had shown a significant kinetic interaction with RVG. The mAb immobilized onto the NHS-activated Sepharose 4 fast flow™ was used for the purification of rRVG by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IAC). The bound rRVG was eluted in IAC using 0. 1 M glycine with pH 2. 5 and the identity of the purified protein was confirmed by MALDI-TOF. The IAC purified rRVG induced neutralizing antibody response and 83 % of the immunized mice were protected against intra-cerebral rabies virus challenge.

To investigate whether the apolipoprotein composition of HDL plays a role in the selective delivery of cholesterol esters to the liver in vivo, we labelled HDL in its cholesterol ester moiety and separated [3 H]cholesterol oleate-labelled HDL into subclasses LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Serum decay and liver association of LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II were compared for the apoprotein and cholesterol ester moieties. Both LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II selectively delivered cholesterol esters to the liver with similar kinetics. The kinetics of biliary secretion of processed cholesterol esters, initially associated with LpA-I or LpA-I/A-II, were studied in rats equipped with permanent catheters in bile, duodenum and heart. For both LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II, liver association was coupled to bile acid synthesis, with an increase in secretion rate during the night. During the first night period, the biliary secretion of LpA-I-derived radio-activity was significantly greater than for LpA-I/A-II. The data indicate that with both LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II selective delivery of cholesterol esters from HDL to the liver occurs, but that cholesterol esters delivered by LpA-I are more efficiently coupled to bile acid synthesis...|$|E

The speccity of Mab 1 was determined by Western blot analysis of tissues obtained from estrous rabbits and from the male rabbit reproductive tract. SOG was ident Wed in tissue extracts of both the oviductal ampulla and isthmus. Cervix was the only non-oviductal tissue with which Mab 1 cross-reacted.

Antibody EFG- 4 (IgG 1) recognizes a proteinase-sensitive segment {{associated with the}} core protein. Antibody BCD- 4 (IgG 1) reacts with keratan sulphate bound to core protein. Both epitopes are minimally expressed in foetal cartilage and increase with age after birth to become maximally expressed in adult cartilage by about 30 years of age. In contrast, monoclonal antibody alpha HFPG- 846 (IgM) recognizes a core-protein-related epitope that is maximally expressed in young foetal cartilage, declines up to birth and thereafter and is almost absent after about 30 years of age. Antibody alpha HFPG- 846 was used to isolate by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> two subpopulations of proteoglycan subunits from a 16 -year-old-human cartilage proteoglycan subunit preparation. Only the antibody-unbound population showed a significant reaction with antibodies EGF- 4 and BCD- 4.

These observations demonstrate that human cartilages contain at least two chemically and immunochemically distinct populations of proteoglycans, the proportions and content of which are age-dependent.

Expression of G 1 cyclins CLN 1 and CLN 2 is regulated by the transcription factor SBF (composed of Swi 4 p and Swi 6 p) and depends on the cyclin-dependent Cdc 28 protein kinase and cyclin Cln 3 p. To identify novel regulators of SBF-dependent gene expression we screened for mutants that fail to activate transcription of G 1 cyclins. We found mutations in a gene called CTR 9. ctr 9 mutants are inviable at 37 C and accumulate large cells. CTR 9 is identical to CDP 1. CTR 9 encodes a conserved nuclear protein of 125 kDa containing several TPR repeats implicated in protein–protein interactions. We show that Ctr 9 p is a component of a high molecular weight protein complex. Using <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> we found that Ctr 9 p associates with polypeptides of 50 and 65 kDa. By mass spectro-metry these were identified as Cdc 73 p and Paf 1 p. We show that Paf 1 p, like Ctr 9 p, is required for efficient CLN 2 transcription, whereas Cdc 73 p is not. Paf 1 p and Cdc 73 p were previously reported to be RNA poly-merase II-associated proteins, suggesting that the Ctr 9 p complex may interact with the general transcription apparatus...|$|E

40|$|In vitro, {{efficient}} translocation and glycosylation of {{the precursor}} of yeast alpha-factor {{can take place}} post-translationally. This property of prepro-alpha-factor appears to be unique as {{it could not be}} extended to other yeast protein precursors such as preinvertase or preprocarboxypeptidase Y. In order to determine if specific domains of prepro-alpha-factor were involved in post-translational translocation, we carried out a series of experiments in which major domains were either deleted or fused onto reporter proteins. Fusion of various domains of prepro-alpha-factor onto the reporter protein alpha-globin did not allow post-translational translocation to occur in the yeast in vitro system. Prepro-alpha-factor retained its ability to be post-translationally translocated when parts or all of the pro region were deleted. Removal of the C-terminal repeats containing mature alpha-factor had the most profound influence as post-translational translocation decreased in proportion to the number of repeats deleted. Taken together, these results suggest that efficient post-translational translocation requires a signal sequence and the four C-terminal repeats. There does not however, appear to be specific information contained within the C-terminus, as their presence in fusion did not enable the post-translational translocation of reporter proteins. Lastly, the ability to post-translationally translocate radiochemically pure prepro-alpha-factor that had been isolated by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> required the addition of a yeast lysate fraction.

The uPAR purified from the ascitic fluid has no bound ligand (uPA), as similar amounts can be purified by ligand-affinity chromatography as by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> uPAR from ascitic fluids partitions in the water phase after a temperature-dependent phase separation of a detergent extract. It therefore lacks at least the lipid moiety of the glycophospholipid anchor present in cellular-bound uPARs. It is highly glycosylated and the deglycosylated form has the same electrophoretic mobility as previously characterized cellular uPAR from other sources. The immunoreactivity of the purified uPAR from the ascitic fluid is indistinguishable from that of characterized uPAR, demonstrated by Western blotting with three different anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies. The uPAR was found in 11 of 11 ascitic fluids from patients with ovarian cancer and in elevated amounts in the plasma from 2 of 3 patients. The concentration of soluble uPAR in the ascitic fluid was estimated to range between 1 and 10 ng/ml. Human soluble uPAR, derived from the tumor cells, was {{also found in the}} ascitic fluid and serum from nude mice xenografted intraperitoneally with three different human ovarian carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|We {{have raised}} {{polyclonal}} antibodies against {{each of three}} subunits of the new basement membrane component nicein (formerly BM- 600), the antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody GB 3 (Biochem Biophys Acta 942 : 45 - 56, 1988). Preparation of such antibodies was achieved from gel electrophoresis purification of nicein isolated by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> These antibodies were reactive with each transblotted denatured nicein subunit and recognized the native protein both in cultured keratinocytes and in all normal human basement membranes where the GB 3 antigen is located. A reciprocal immuno-cross-reactivity was detected with the antibodies directed against the 100 -kD and 150 -kD (sometimes resolved as a 146 - 150 -kD doublet) subunits of nicein, showing that they share some identical epitopes. In tissues and keratinocyte cultures from patients with the Herlitz form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), GB 3 is unable to recognize nicein, and the question arises whether {{this is due to}} an absence of synthesis or a structural abnormality of the protein. We report here that the polyclonal antibody directed against the 150 -kD subunit of nicein binds its antigen in H-JEB patients (although usually less intensely than in control skin), whereas the other two antibodies either do not recognize or recognize only weakly their respective antigen subunits. These data suggest that nicein is present but structurally altered in basement membranes from H-JEB tissues. Furthermore, in non-Herlitz junctional and dystrophic types of epidermolysis bullosa, all three polyclonal antibodies recognize their antigens normally. Consequently, such antibodies should serve as potentially useful molecular tools for studying the expression of nicein in H-JEB...|$|E
40|$|Starvation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{cells for}} {{specific}} nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate or sulphate causes arrest in the G 1 {{phase of the}} cell cycle at a specific point called 'start'. Re-addition of different nitrogen sources, phosphate or sulphate to such starved cells causes activation of trehalase within a few minutes. Nitrogen-source- and sulphate-induced activation of trehalase were not associated with {{any change in the}} cAMP level, {{but in the case of}} phosphate there was a small transient increase. When nitrogen-source-activated trehalase was isolated by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> from crude extracts, the purified enzyme showed the same activity profile as in the original crude extracts, indicating that post-translational modification is responsible for the activation. In the yeast mutants cdc 25 - 5 and cdc 35 - 10, which are temperature sensitive for cAMP synthesis, incubation at the restrictive temperature lowered but did not prevent nitrogen-, phosphate- or sulphate-induced activation of trehalase. Since under these conditions the cAMP level in the cells is very low, it is unlikely that cAMP acts as a second messenger in this nutrient-induced effect. Nitrogen-source-induced activation of trehalase requires the presence of glucose at a concentration similar to that able to stimulate the RAS-adenylate cyclase pathway. This indicates that the same glucose-sensing system might be involved in both phenomena. Nitrogen-starved cells fractionated according to cell size all showed nitrogen-source-induced activation of trehalase to the same extent, indicating that the nitrogen-induced signalling pathway involved is not dependent on the well-known cell size requirement for progression over the start point of the cell cycle. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} an {{in vitro complementation}} system that has allowed us to investigate the role of individual purified snRNPs in the splicing of pre-mRNA molecules. For the preparation of snRNP-depleted nuclear extracts we have first removed the majority of endogenous snRNPs from the nuclear extracts by one passage over an anti-m 3 G column and then degraded the remaining snRNPs with micrococcal nuclease. The mixture of snRNPs U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6 and U 5, obtained by anti-m 3 G <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography,</b> was functionally active and able to restore the splicing of snRNP-depleted nuclear extracts. Mono-Q chromatography was used for further fractionation of the snRNPs U 1 -U 6. This produced three fractions that were highly enriched in snRNPs U 1 and U 2, U 5 and U 4 /U 6 respectively. Conditions were found where addition of the [U 1, U 2] and the U 4 /U 6 snRNP fractions to the snRNP-depleted nuclear extracts {{gave rise to the}} formation of splice intermediates {{in the absence of any}} 3 ' cleavage/exon 1 -exon 2 product formation. Only when purified 20 S U 5 snRNPs were added did both steps of the splicing reaction occur efficiently. Our data suggest that U 5 snRNP is absolutely required for the second step of splicing and is needed further for efficient initiation of the splicing reaction. The requirement for U 5 snRNPs for splicing was corroborated by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of the respective reconstituted pre-mRNP complexes. Stable and efficient formation of 50 - 60 S spliceosomes was observed only in the presence of all snRNPs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} two distinct pools of superoxide dismutase in fractions of human peripheral neutrophils {{obtained by the}} isopycnic fractionation of homogenates of the latter with linear sucrose gradients. Superoxide dismutase activity, observed with polyacrylamide gels impregnated with Nitro Blue Tetrazolium, was present in: (1) the mitochondrial fraction [density (ρ) 1. 169 g/ml], containing the high-molecular-weight KCN-resistant enzyme, and (2) the cytoplasm fraction, containing the low-molecular-weight KCN-sensitive enzyme. Superoxide dismutase activity, observed with a quantitative assay involving cytochrome c, was present in: (1) the mitochondria, (2) the cytoplasm, and (3) the azurophil-granule fractions (ρ= 1. 206 and 1. 222 g/ml). No substantial enzyme activity was observed in specific-granule fractions (ρ= 1. 187 g/ml) or in the membranous fraction (ρ= 1. 136 g/ml) in either assay. The apparent superoxide dismutase activity observed in the azurophil granules with the cytochrome c assay was attributable not to true superoxide dismutase but to myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found solely in the azurophil granules. In the presence of H 2 O 2, human neutrophil myeloperoxidase oxidized ferrocytochrome c. Thus, in the cytochrome c assay for superoxide dismutase, the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by myeloperoxidase mimicked the inhibition of reduction of ferricytochrome c by superoxide dismutase. When myeloperoxidase was removed from azurophilgranule fractions by specific <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography,</b> both myeloperoxidase and apparent superoxide dismutase activities were removed. It is concluded {{that there is no}} detectable superoxide dismutase in either the azurophil or specific granules of human neutrophils. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, 15 % of the total dismutase activity of the cells, occurred only in fractions of density 1. 160 g/ml, where isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were also observed...|$|E
40|$|Most cells release {{membrane}} vesicles {{for various}} purposes including, {{but not limited}} to, intercellular communication and disposal of membrane and soluble proteins. These vesicles are secreted into urine coming from the cells lining the urinary tract and bladder epithelium. These vesicles are a promising source of biomarkers for various cardiovascular and renal diseases. This thesis pursues twofold objectives, one being the development and improvement of an isolation method for urinary membrane vesicles and the second being proteomic characterization {{of the content of}} these vesicles. These objectives are important to realise the clinical potential of these vesicles. An alternative method for removal of contaminant high-abundant proteins was developed which preserves the activity of vesicular proteins. Moreover, lipid-affinity and lectin-affinity-based novel methods to enrich membrane vesicles from minimally processed urine were evaluated and developed. More than 600 proteins were identified in urinary membrane vesicles using shotgun proteomic analysis. Post-translational modification (PTM) proteomics was carried out to identify the PTM status of vesicular proteins. Many different PTMs like glycosylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation were assessed. Surface glycan profiles of these vesicles were elucidated using fluorophore-linked lectin assay (FLLA) employing 18 different lectins. Lectin blotting, lectin-affinity chromatography using multiple lectins and hydrazide chemistry based enrichment of glycoproteins were carried out. As a result, 108 glycoproteins were identified. <b>Immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> was used to enrich and identify ubiquitin-conjugated proteins present in urinary membrane vesicles. A number of potential palmitoylated proteins were identified as well. Computational prediction and validation methods were applied to these protein lists. In conclusion, novel methods to isolate urinary membrane vesicles were developed. In addition, a thorough proteomic characterisation of contents of urinary membrane vesicles was achieved. This work will serve as platform for further characterization of urinary membrane vesicles...|$|E
40|$|Human lung {{fibroblasts}} produce heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) {{that are}} associated with the plasma membrane. A monoclonal-antibody (Mab) -secreting hybridoma, S 1, was produced by fusion of SP 2 / 0 -AG 14 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified cellular HSPG fractions. The HSPG character of the material carrying the epitope recognized by Mab S 1 was demonstrated by: (i) the co-purification of the S 1 epitope with the membrane HSPG of human lung fibroblasts; (ii) the decrease in size of the material carrying the S 1 epitope upon treatment with heparinase or heparitinase, and the resistance of this material to heparinase treatment after N-desulphation. The S 1 epitope appears {{to be part of the}} core protein, since it was destroyed by proteinase treatment and by disulphide-bond reduction, but not by treatments that depolymerize the glycosaminoglycan chains and N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of non-reduced heparitinase-digested membrane HSPG followed by Western blotting and immunostaining with Mab S 1 revealed a single band with apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa. Membrane proteoglycans isolated from detergent extracts or from 4 M-guanidinium chloride extracts of the cells yielded similar results. Additional digestion with N-glycanase lowered the apparent molecular mass of the immunoreactive material to 56 kDa, suggesting that the core protein also carries N-linked oligosaccharides. Fractionation of 125 I-labelled membrane HSPG by <b>immuno-affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> on immobilized Mab S 1, followed by heparitinase digestion and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the bound material, yielded a single labelled band with apparent molecular mass 64 kDa. Treatment with dithiothreitol caused a slight increase in apparent molecular mass, suggesting that the core protein of this membrane proteoglycan of a single subunit containing (an) intrachain disulphide bond(s) ...|$|E
