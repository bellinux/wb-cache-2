5|$|The Cape sparrow <b>is</b> <b>social,</b> {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and <b>is</b> <b>social</b> with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} {{a variety of}} calls; the two most common being the alarm call, made when {{possible}} predators (such as humans or other mammals) enter the colonies, and the advertising call. The advertising call <b>is</b> <b>social</b> in nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the bird song of passerines, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from begging calls made by females during mating to attack calls made while swooping at intruders.|$|E
5|$|Within its Indus valley {{breeding}} range in Pakistan and western India, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with thorny scrub and tall grass. During the non-breeding season, some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran. Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The Sind sparrow <b>is</b> <b>social</b> within small groups while feeding and breeding, and during its winter dispersal. It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging {{close to the}} ground. Nests {{are made in the}} branches of thorny trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness <b>is</b> <b>social</b> skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction.
