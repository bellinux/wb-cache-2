40|$|Kenaf {{has never}} been a major crop in Nigeria, but it has {{provided}} raw material for the manufacture of jute bags and for making high quality paper and newsprint; and the bark has been used for cordage (ropes). The establishment by government, in 1960, of two factories to produce bags for the export of cocoa and palm kernel stimulated production. But production could not be maintained because of the erratic supply of raw material and transport problems, and raw jute had to be imported in large quantities to supply the factories. In 1990 the Federal Ministry of Agriculture organized a national workshop to resuscitate interest in kenaf production, processing and marketing. This brought together people from {{the public and private sectors}} and subsequently generated widespread demand for kenaf seeds, with interested farmers forming the Kenaf Association of Nigeria (KEAN). Currently about 500 hectares of kenaf are being cultivated annually with a yield of approximately it/ha of fibre. However, commercial production of kenaf has not been started on a significant scale because of shortage of kenaf seeds. Processing has also been recognized as a key area for investment. At the primary level Kenaf processing is very laborious and a survey by KEAN has shown that the <b>decorticators</b> installed in the early years of the industry cannot be economically rehabilitated; they will need replacing.

40|$|Background: Very {{little is}} known about work and health in the sisal industry. Previous studies on sisal are old and mainly focused on sisal fibre {{textiles}} and rope factories. Stationary dust concentration rather than personal exposures has been measured in a few studies but not bio-aerosols content of sisal dust. Globally, Tanzania occupies a third place in annual sisal export. Production methods in Tanzanian sisal factories are still labour intensive, implying that many workers are currently employed in the country’s 82 sisal estates. Yet very {{little is known}} about work-related health risks among sisal workers in Tanzania. Methods: Six sisal processing factories were selected for the study. Walkthrough surveys were conducted in the decortication and brushing departments and all 165 sisal processing workers (exposed) in these departments (including 93 <b>decorticators,</b> 72 brushing) and 32 randomly selected security guards (low exposed) were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Daily interviews on acute respiratory symptoms arising during or after work, and assessment of peak expiratory flow rates before and after work shifts were performed from Monday to Friday. All sisal workers and security guards were also interviewed for chronic respiratory symptoms. Thirty-eight randomly selected sisal workers were involved to collect personal dust samples using 30 cellulose acetate and 48 polycarbonate filters for gravimetric dust analysis and for bacteria and fungi spore counting, respectively. Furthermore, 138 out of 165 sisal processing workers and 78 conveniently sampled urban-based control participants were skin prick tested with dry and fresh sisal extracts. Serum samples from a subset of 43 skin pricked participants were tested for total and sisal specific IgE, PhadiatopTM, and ELISA. A fresh sisal extract was examined by SDS PAGE (electrophoresis method) to look for sisal allergen proteins. Results: Walkthrough surveys indicated generally poor working conditions in five of the six sisal factories, with workplaces characterized by wet floors, visible dust emissions, long stressful work shifts, monotonous tasks at awkward postures and heavy manual lifting. Use of personal protective equipment and other general occupational health and safety services was almost absent. Old brushing and decortication machinery from as early as the 1890 s was still in use. The arithmetic mean exposure of all sisal processors was 1. 18 mg thoracic dust/m 3, 43 x 106 bacteria /m 3, and 2. 35 x 106 fungal spores/m 3. The highest mean thoracic dust (2. 06 mg/m 3), bacteria spores (230 x 106 /m 3) as well as fungal spores (15. 10 x 106 /m 3) were measured when cleaning corona drums at the decortication. Personal exposure measurements showed significant differences in thoracic dust levels and bacteria exposures between work departments and workers tasks. Positive correlations were found between fungal and bacteria counts (r = 0. 47; p = 0. 01; n = 32), but no significant differences were detected among the study groups for fungal exposure. Mixed effect models including the brushing and decortication departments explained 64. 7 % of the thoracic dust exposure variance between workers. The models also showed that working in the brushing department was a significant exposure determinant (p = 0. 04) After the first day of work (Monday), and when compared to security guards, odds ratios for sisal processing workers were for sneezing 4. 2 (95 %CI; 1. 6 – 11. 1) and for dry cough 2. 9 (95 %CI; 1. 3 – 5. 4) after adjusting for age, smoking and past respiratory illnesses. Compared to decortication workers, brushing workers had significantly higher odds ratio for sneezing; 3. 2 (95 %CI; 1. 6 – 6. 2) and stuffy nose 3. 1 (95 %CI; 1. 4 – 7. 0). With the exception of shortness of breath and wheezing, brushing workers had significantly higher prevalence for all acute respiratory symptoms than decortication workers. During the five days of follow-up, brushing workers showed significantly higher severity scores and prevalences for most acute respiratory symptom than security guards and <b>decorticators.</b> Compared to security guards, workers in decortication had significantly higher prevalence of shortness of breath. A significantly decreasing trend across the week was found for the prevalence of shortness of breath among brushing workers (from 39 % to 20 %: P 100 kU/L) IgE levels. Analysis of the sisal extract showed two IgE binding protein bands at 45 kDa. Discussion and conclusion: The combined effect of poor working conditions, use of old machinery and lack of protective clothing implies increased health risks due to possible exposures to sisal dust and bio-aerosols among sisal processing workers. Sisal processing workers had significantly higher severity scores and prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and were more sensitized to sisal than controls, indicating a possible association with exposure arising within the sisal fibre processing areas. Dust and bio-aerosol exposure levels appear to be higher for some tasks, emphasizing the need to consider differences in workers tasks when assessing workplace exposures and when planning control measures. Preventive action and more studies are recommended in this industry...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum and millet {{were the}} {{indigenous}} staple foods {{of much of}} Africa before maize became popular, after its introduction by the Portuguese in the 17 th century. They remain the staples of thirteen African countries with a total population of some 200 million people. Research indicates the potential for substantial yield increases and improved technology could provide better processing and new uses for these hardy grain crops. As Africa strives {{to close the gap}} between population and food production, sorghum and millet will become of increasing importance. This will be especially so where weather patterns are unpredictable because maize is much less adaptable to inadequate erratic rainfall. There are two broad categories of sorghum; red or brown sorghums, which often contain bitter tasting tannins in the seed coat, and white sorghums, which do not. The tannins deter predators but must be removed in order to make grain acceptable for human consumption. Sorghum is both drought-resistant and able to tolerate waterlogging better than maize because of its deep and well-branched root system. It is also remarkably pest-resistant, but unfortunately the compounds that help protect the crop from birds and insects make the grain and the stover less palatable and less digestible for people and livestock. Search for new varieties There are also two major types of millet; finger millet and bulrush millet. They are very different in appearance. The grain of finger millet is contained in a 'hand' of digits (hence the name) and the plant seldom grows higher than 1. 3 metres. Bulrush millet can grow to 3 metres. Millets are even more drought resistant than sorghum and can give good yields on infertile, sandy soil which would be unsuitable for most cereals. But millets are very susceptible to bird damage and, as more children attend school and are not available to scare birds, this can cause considerable losses. Farmers are also inclined to switch to maize, as has happened in Kenya and Tanzania, because millets and sorghum demand a great deal more work to harvest, store and process. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) based in Hyderabad, India, has collected the seeds of over 22, 500 varieties of sorghum and 15, 500 varieties of millet. During the past decade, expeditions to India, northern Nigeria, southern Sudan, Malawi and Sierra Leone collected many sorghums and millets, including some wild ones. From this seed-bank of genetic diversity {{it should be possible to}} breed more new varieties with higher yields and even great resistance to drought. ICRISAT also has operations in Africa in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger and Zimbabwe. The two main bases in Africa are the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre (ISC) near Niamey, Niger, and the SADCC/ICRISAT sorghum and millets improvement programme at Matapos, near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Inter-African research collaboration is also assisted through the Semi-Arid Foodgrains Research and Development (SAFGRAD) of the Organization of African Unity, which is based in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso. Improved processing and new uses Sorghum and millet are very similar to maize in their nutritional value. Traditionally both grains are prepared by pounding to remove the husks but, millet and sorghum flour does not keep well and fresh flour has to be prepared regularly. New techniques for easier processing are urgently needed and there have been some promising developments in mechanical decortication. A dry abrasive technique for milling of the husk off sorghum was developed from a Canadian design and promoted by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). About 40 machines were made locally and installed in Botswana, and trials and demonstrations set up in several other SADCC countries. These <b>decorticators</b> proved well-suited to small-scale operations, as the cost of equipment is low. The cost of transportation of grain and products to and from the mill is minimized, employment is created in rural areas and, when milling a reasonably pure strain of white sorghum, a high yield of excellent quality product can be obtained. However, it is more difficult to process mixed crops to acceptable levels of colour and taste. An alternative technique for semi-wet milling of sorghum has been developed by the UK Natural Resources Institute (NRI). The whole sorghum grain is wetted with up to 25 % water and after 12 hours the conditioned grain is milled in a roller mill in the same way as maize or wheat. Even in highly bird resistant varieties of red sorghum the endosperm is normally white, and using this technique the white endosperm is effectively separated, leaving the bran and most of the coloured layers clean and almost intact. Semi-wet milling is not the answer for all situations, however, since it is unlikely that the process will be economically viable at a throughput of less than two tonnes per hour. Also, the meal produced has over 20 % moisture and is unsuitable for long-term storage. If techniques can be perfected to make sustainable use of much larger quantities of millet and sorghum (particularly red sorghum), which can be grown on the extensive and still under-utilized semi-arid lands of Africa, the consequences will be profound and far reaching: on food security, on rural employment and on agricultural income in many parts of the continent. Sorghum and millet were the indigenous staple foods of much of Africa before maize became popular, after its introduction by the Portuguese in the 17 th century. They remain the staples of thirteen African countries with a total population of some [...] ...|$|R

In 1916, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 [...] "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material", in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was [...] "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood". Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production. However, later research does not confirm this. The concentration of cellulose in hemp hurds is only between 32% and 38% (not 77%, a number often repeated by Jack Herer and others on the Internet). [...] Manufacture of paper with hemp as a raw material has shown that hemp lacks the qualities needed to become a major competitor to the traditional paper industry, which still uses wood or waste paper as raw material. In 2003, 95% of the hemp hurds in the EU were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material.

PALF {{have been widely used}} as a raw material for pulp and paper making industry in Malaysia recently. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is one of the high textile grade fibers which are commonly extracted by <b>decorticator</b> machine. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade. Hence, it has been widely used to make apparel. Apart from being used as an alternative fiber for home textile and apparel, PALF meet the basic requirement to be used as technical fibers. This paper presented the possibility of PALF utilization as technical fibers in rope making. PALF have similarity properties with others natural rope fibers and its can be spun into rope yarn. Instead of having a good strength, PALF also have a reasonable length as well as can be pliable. All of these are the main principle of rope making fibers. As PALF have meet this entire requirement, {{it can be said that}} its have huge potential to be used as rope making fibers...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum {{grains of}} three types (yellow, bronze, and white) grown in Nebraska were {{decorticated}} and milled by two methods, the Udy-Cyclone mill and the Brabender mill. The yellow variety showed a slightly lower protein content {{than the other}} two varieties. All three decorticated sorghum flours had lower lipid and ash contents than the corresponding whole grain flours. The tannin content also decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) after decortication. A hardness study revealed that the abrasive hardness index (AHI) was correlated with other measures of grain hardness. Differences among damaged starch were effected based on the shearing speeds of the Udy-Cyclone <b>decorticator</b> as well as the milling processes but independent of sorghum variety. Flour which was made from the Brabender mill showed higher pasting viscosities for all three types. Samples from both mills presented high setback when cooled to 50 C. ^ Two types of sorghum flakes were developed. One was made from the whole grain sorghum, and the other was made from the decorticated sorghum flour. To develop an acceptable sorghum flake, various parameters such as the moisture content, soaking, cooking, flaking, and toasting conditions were studied. On the laboratory scale, the optimal conditions to make whole grain sorghum flakes were as follows: 40...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha fruit, {{presently}} dehulled manually in {{the absence}} of a suitable mechanical device. Manual decortications of Jatropha fruit for the purpose of extracting seeds is a time consuming and tedious operation. A small, continuous, hand-operated machine, specially designed and constructed for decortications of Jatropha fruits has been done and evaluated for performance parameters. The major components of the machine are the frame, hopper, decorticating chamber, concave sieve, rotating blades, discharge outlet and a vibrating separator with sieve to separate seed and shell. The performance parameters of the machine including Percentage of whole seed, broken seed, partially shelled fruit, unshelled fruit, machine efficiency and decortications efficiency, were evaluated at four different moisture content (7. 97 %, 10. 53 %, 13. 09 % and 15. 65 % d. b.) with a combinations of concave clearance (18 Â mm, 21 Â mm, 24 Â mm and 27 Â mm) between concave sieve and rotating blades. The best set of conditions under which the <b>decorticator</b> can be operated is at fruit moisture content of 7. 97 % d. b. with concave clearance of 21 Â mm between the concave and the blade at which the maximum whole seeds of 67. 94 % can be achieved and machine efficiency of 90. 96 % can be obtained. All materials used for fabricating the components were brought from sourced locally. This design is preferred, because of its rapid operation, low human-energy expenditure, low breakage factor for the seed as well as relatively little dust being emitted during shelling; hence leading to a relatively-healthier local atmosphere for the operator.

40|$|Pearl millet is {{a staple}} food in Namibia. It is milled into flour by {{traditional}} and industrial dry milling processes. This {{research was conducted}} to help determine how to improve the nutritional value and acceptability of pearl millet. The traditional milling process involves a lactic acid fermentation step which lowers the pH of kernels. The effects of the traditional Namibian and industrial “dry milling” processes on the physical and nutritional composition of pearl millet grain were compared. Additionally, the effect of steeping three different Namibian pearl millet varieties (Kangara, Kantana and Okashana 2) in lactic acid and water on the colour and the phenolic content of the flour were determined. Regarding comparing the milling processes, variety Kangara was conditioned and decorticated traditionally with a pestle and mortar and industrially with an abrasive <b>decorticator.</b> The traditional decorticated grain was steeped and sun dried for 24 h before hammer milling, whereas the industrially decorticated grain was roller milled. Tristimulus colorimetry and proximate analyses were conducted on the samples. Concerning acid steeping, kernels were steeped in a pH 3. 5 solution and in water as a control. Colour, total polyphenol and c-glycosyl flavone contents were determined. The determination of cglycosylflavone content was particularly important because these compounds are considered goitrogenic. The traditionally milled flour was lighter in colour than industrial milled flour. However, it was significantly lower in protein, ash and c-glycosyl flavone contents in comparison to industrial milled flour. This {{was due to the}} removal of more pericarp and germ in the traditional process. The industrial dry milling process therefore produces flour with a higher nutrient content in terms of protein, fat and minerals. However, the traditional Namibian milling process makes the colour of the pearl millet flour lighter, which is probably the reason that it is more acceptable to consumers. Kernels steeped in a lactic acid solution were lighter in colour than those steeped in water. Irrespective of the steeping media, the total polyphenol content was significantly lower in steeped kernels compared to those unsteeped. A similar trend was observed for the cglycosyl flavone content. This indicates that some of these compounds may have leached out during steeping. For all varieties, kernels steeped in lactic acid had a significantly higher total polyphenol content than those in water, probably due to the dissociation of metal-polyphenol complexes in the acidic medium whereby these polyphenols became free and available for measurement. Thus, steeping in a lactic acid solution can lead to better colour improvement of kernels compared to steeping in water. Thus, lactic acid steeping can improve the sensory quality of pearl millet products. An industrial process can thus be designed to include tempering the grain with food grade lactic acid to produce sour taste and leach out the colour pigments, particularly the cglycosyl flavones hence lightening the colour of the industrial milled flour. This produces a product with high nutritional content, lighter in colour and has the sour taste that consumers find appealing. Copyright 2007, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved.

40|$|Hungry rice (Digitaria exilis) {{has been}} largely {{neglected}} by scientists and plant breeders in the past, but it is now being reappraised. Now that consumers have shown that they value it as a food crop, plant breeders are making use of genetic mutation techniques {{in order to improve}} its performance. Always difficult to process, the potential for hungry, rice may be further improved by a Senegalese invention of a <b>decorticator</b> which avoids the need for pounding. Hungry rice, known also as fonio, fundi, ocha and kabuga, grows only in West Africa in a region of some 300, 000 hectares. Annual production is estimated to be about 100, 000 tonnes. It {{can be used as a}} porridge or added to other cereals as meal. It can also be used as fodder and its stems can be used as a roofing material. Hungry rice will tolerate marginal land and, on poor soil, will grow better than any other crop. In fact farmers say that if nothing else will survive on a particular piece of land, then that is the place to sow hungry rice. Although this plant is one of the most hardy in Africa, it possesses a number of drawbacks. One single grain of hungry rice produces a multitude of stems or tillers and while this could be an advantage in terms of density of seedlings, it presents a problem when it comes to weeding because the stems are so fragile. Further more, the rampant, climbing characteristic of the plant makes harvesting difficult and, in any case, yields are very low indeed. It takes between 1. 6 and 2. 5 million hungry rice grains to make one kilo. At the present time, production is no greater than 150 to 600 kg per hectare. Nevertheless, hungry rice is much sought after. In Mali its price is triple that c>f millet and it is sold at double the price of rice or millet flour. Moreover it's consumption is expanding rapidly in towns, in particular for feast days or ceremonies such as the end of Ramadan. Even though research into this cereal has hardly begun, experts acknowledge that it has exceptional nutritional qualities. In contrast to other cereals where the germ, which is rich in fats, never disappears completely when hulled, the hulled grains of hungry rice contain practically no lipids. This is another reason why interest in this crop is growing among agriculturalists and in June 1994 the Programme for the Promotion of Indigenous Cereals of the Sahel in Bamako, Mali dedicated an international workshop to hungry rice. Improving productivity and processing Scientists have started to improve the plant by subjecting it to the now well-proven technique of irradiation in order to stimulate genetic mutations. The project for domesticating hungry rice is being undertaken by M. Sansan Da at the agricultural research station of Farakoba in the west of Burkina Faso and has been assisted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based in Vienna. Although the project has only just begun it is already showing great promise. In order to domesticate such an unimproved plant, it is necessary to modify its genetic characteristics in order to obtain seeds that are more productive and easier to decorticate. This is where irradiation has proved to be important stimulating major disruptions within the chromosomes of the plant and providing plant breeders with a diverse range of new characteristics from which to select the most useful traits. Field trials have been conducted over four years and yields of 2 to 2. 5 tonnes per hectare have been achieved at the agricultural field station at Farakoba. This is a three to four-fold increase over traditional varieties. It seems that despite its reputation for low yields, hungry rice could now achieve the same level of performance as little millet (Panicum sumatrense). Another useful characteristic of the new variety of hungry rice that has been developed by Sansan Da is that it is dehiscent. This means that the husk of the grain has the distinctive characteristic of being slightly open at the top and this tiny detail, visible only with a magnifying glass, is a big step towards the domestication of hungry rice. Unlike other indigenous cereals, traditional landraces of hungry rice have a protective husk to the grain which sticks to it and surrounds it completely. This makes extraction of the germ very difficult and experts think that it is the difficulty of processing hungry rice that makes it so expensive at the market place. With a dehiscent husk, much less energy is required for post-harvest treatment. With a combination of higher yields, improved processing and an already-proven market demand, hungry rice could have a more significant future than might once have been expected.
