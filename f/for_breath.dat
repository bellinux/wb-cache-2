5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping <b>for</b> <b>breath,</b> but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps <b>for</b> <b>breath</b> after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling <b>for</b> <b>breath,</b> and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands <b>for</b> <b>breath,</b> bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E

And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps <b>for</b> <b>breath,</b> he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E

One morning, the eight-year-old awoke with a sore throat and pains in her chest, which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much {{excitement}} with her cousins the previous day. Her fever rose to 104 degrees. The imperial party didn't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned. By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started gasping <b>for</b> <b>breath.</b> A specialist was summoned from Warsaw. The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart, but without success.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to establish a reliable method of measuring diaphragm movement during relaxed tidal breathing. This study follows a previous study in which test-retest reliability was established <b>for</b> maximal <b>breaths</b> but not <b>for</b> tidal <b>breaths</b> (Blaney and Sawyer 1997). Twelve normal subjects were tested in a semi-reclined long sitting position. Sonographic measurements were taken <b>for</b> tidal <b>breaths</b> during four different patterns of breathing. All <b>breaths</b> were controlled <b>for</b> inspired volume. Testing was repeated one week later under the same conditions. The results showed that the method for measuring diaphragmatic movement at tidal breathing during a given pattern of breathing was reliable. This method will allow further investigation of the diaphragm during different breathing manoeuvres at tidal volume...|$|R

500|$|The {{battle at}} Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, {{due largely to}} the dense fog and terrible weather that {{hampered}} his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements {{did not seem to}} hamper Charles. [...] The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gründonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or Maundy Thursday), the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers huddled in their cellars, and hoped for the best and gasping <b>for</b> <b>breath</b> as the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000or so soldiers who died in the battle.|$|E
500|$|On {{the ninth}} {{birthday}} of the severely ill Tamsin, parents Graham and Jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons. A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, {{much to the}} excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in her bedroom, and blows up a purple balloon for her. He begins to struggle <b>for</b> <b>breath</b> and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm. Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says {{that no one can}} touch anything or call an ambulance until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her [...] "a neutral". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage may be worth.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinctive}} deliberate mispronunciation of [...] "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled [...] "c'mon", [...] "cha'mone", or [...] "shamone", is also {{a staple}} in impressions and caricatures of him. The turn of the 1990s saw {{the release of the}} introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, [...] "he gulps <b>for</b> <b>breath,</b> his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" [...] and he had a [...] "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to [...] "smooth" [...] vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone was of the opinion that, at age 43, Jackson still performed [...] "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies". Nelson George wrote: [...] "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist". Cultural critic Joseph Vogel notes that Jackson had a [...] "distinctive styles is his ability to convey emotion without the use of language: there are his trademark gulps, grunts, gasps, cries, exclamations; he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible." [...] Neil McCormick notes that Jackson's unorthodox singing style [...] "was original and utterly distinctive, from his almost ethereal falsetto to his soft, sweet mid-tones; his fluid, seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes; his percussive yet still melodic outbursts, ululations and interjections (from those spooky [...] "tee-hee-hees" [...] to grunts and wails). Unusually for someone coming from a black American soul tradition, he did not often sing straight, unadorned ballads, though when he did (from 'Ben' to 'She's Out of My Life') the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth." ...|$|E
