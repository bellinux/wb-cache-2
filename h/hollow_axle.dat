50|$|The Klien-Lindner axle uses a double, or <b>hollow,</b> <b>axle,</b> one {{inside the}} other. It has a <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> (Hohlachse) on the outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a Cardan joint to a fixed driving axle running through it. The Cardan joint comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on the fixed axle and a hollow one on the outer <b>hollow</b> <b>axle,</b> each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way the <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> can be turned by the fixed axle. In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the fixed axle and the internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|E

The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound which drove the second coupled axle. The low-pressure cylinder on the right was set at an angle due to its large size. The first and fourth coupled <b>axles</b> were Klien-Lindner <b>hollow</b> <b>axles</b> which enabled an outside frame with Hall cranks. Two pull rods arranged in a cross enabled the transverse movement of the two <b>hollow</b> <b>axles</b> to be set by the same amount.|$|R

50|$|The blades must be {{the proper}} length to both {{accommodate}} the desired wheel and have the correct amount of rake to provide the approximate steering geometry intended by the frame designer. The functional length of the fork is typically {{expressed in terms of}} Axle-to-Crown race length (A-C). Also, the axle on the wheel must fit in the fork ends (usually either a 9mm solid or <b>hollow</b> <b>axle,</b> or a 20mm thru-axle). Some manufacturers have introduced forks and matching hubs with proprietary standards, such as Maverick's 24mm axle, Specialized 25mm thru-axle and Cannondale's Lefty system.|$|E
50|$|In one of Trevithick's {{more unusual}} projects, he {{attempted}} to build a 'recoil engine' similar to the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria in about AD 50. Trevithick's engine comprised a boiler feeding a <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> to route the steam to a catherine wheel with two fine-bore steam jets on its circumference. The first wheel was 15 ft in diameter and a later attempt was 24 ft in diameter. To get any usable torque, steam had to issue from the nozzles {{at a very high}} velocity and in such large volume that it proved not to operate with adequate efficiency. Today this would be recognised as a reaction turbine.|$|E

50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a lever operated cam assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the cam lever, thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|E
50|$|The E.636 was {{the first}} Italian {{locomotive}} adopting the Bo-Bo-Bo configuration with chassis divided into two articulated parts pivoting on the central bogie, which is very well suited for the often tortuous lines of Italy {{and that would have}} been later repeated on the E.645/646 and E.656 classes. The presence of a great number of wheels was considered important due to the presence of a number of high-slope lines in the Italian railroad network as it increases the adhesion limit, meaning that the locomotive is less prone to wheel slips. The new engines weighted approximately 101 ST. Engines were initially the same as E.626. The 32R used a 3 kV catenary but this was soon shown to be inadequate and so were updated and provided with a new <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> transmission system. Mainly two different gear ratios were installed: 21/65 for sloping lines or heavy freight trains (maximum speed of 95 km/h, elevated later to 110 km/h), and the longer 28/65, with a maximum speed of 120 km/h, suited for passenger services.|$|E

He also devised improved counterbalanced doors to cover the shaft top, speeding up operations and reducing the danger of injury to men, and damage to the shaft. He designed a steel bucket to carry the coal underground with wheels lubricated from <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> boxes and buffers, giving a smoother ride and lessening the amount of coal dust dropped on the road, and he also devised an engine small enough to be taken down in a cage and which could run along the tracks and be operated by compressed air, removing the need for pit ponies for hauling coal trucks. He installed a compressed air system using two engines to raise and lower equipment at Llanbradach colliery.|$|E

50|$|This {{system is}} used on steam {{locomotives}} with fixed outer frames and coupled axles. Typically the conventionally driven wheels are in the centre and there are outer Klien-Lindner axles, front and rear.

Coupling rods from the conventional driving wheels in the centre act on drive cranks on the inner axles fixed to the frame.|$|R

40|$|Considering <b>hollow</b> railway <b>axles</b> for {{high-speed}} applications, {{an effective}} optimization of the maintenance non-destructive (NDT) inspections is mandatory {{to guarantee a}} safe service. Since observed failures are typically connected to crack propagation phenomena originated by corrosion-fatigue pits or ballast impacts, inspection intervals can be defined, for a given application, by a “damage tolerant” approach based on fracture mechanics concepts and the reliability (“Probability of Detection” curve) of the adopted NDT techniques. Starting from this background, the present paper describes a methodology for the optimization of inspection plans for high-speed axles. First, the design procedure for axles is presented along with the inspection design approach. The latter is here based on the innovative definition of “Model-Assisted Probability of Detection” curves considering a suitable, and cheaper, mix of experimental and numerical results. Then, the boreprobe is described as the fundamental system of an automatic and mechanised procedure, so to diminish the human errors, for inspecting <b>hollow</b> <b>axles.</b> Finally, the derivation of optimised inspection intervals is explained...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hollow</b> <b>axles,</b> {{made from}} a chrome-molybdenum alloy, carry the massive wheels and the wheel set {{bearings}} at each end.

40|$|A {{reliable}} and accurate {{inspection of the}} <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> inner surface {{is important for the}} safe operation of high-speed trains. In order to improve the reliability of the inspection, a flexible arrayed eddy current sensor for non-destructive testing of the <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> inner surface was designed, fabricated and characterized. The sensor, consisting of two excitation traces and 28 sensing traces, was developed by using the flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) technique to conform the geometric features of the inner surfaces of the hollow axles. The main innovative aspect of the sensor was the new arrangement of excitation/sensing traces to achieve a differential configuration. Finite element model was established to analyze sensor responses and to determine the optimal excitation frequency. Experimental validations were conducted on a specimen with several artificial defects. Results from experiments and simulations were consistent with each other, with the maximum relative error less than 4 %. Both results proved that the sensor was capable of detecting longitudinal and transverse defects with the depth of 0. 5 mm under the optimal excitation frequency of 0. 9 MHz...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Due to {{operation}} in complex loading conditions, {{the rolling stock}} wheelsets should provide high reli-ability, since the train traffic safety largely depends on them. Design and technical condition of wheelsets affect the smoothness, intensity of forces generated by {{the interaction between the}} car and track, and the motion resistance. Specificity of the axle operation consists in the fact that it undergoes the bending stresses under loading. These stresses are unevenly distributed along the cross-sectional area, reaching the highest values in the outer fibers and the minimal values in the internal ones. This aspect sets the problem of replacement of the uniform cross section with the hollow cross section. The disadvantages of <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> design, which are used at the present time, should include a significant manufacturing complexity of the variable section cavity.

40|$|Abstract: The hollow {{design of}} a railway axle {{is one of the}} most {{effective}} methods to reduce the weight of an axle. However, the conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>axle</b> has the limitation of a lightweight design because it has the same bore diameter along the axial position. The new type of railway axle, the tapered inner surface railway axle, has a different inner diameter between the journal bearing seat and wheel seat. This design method is one way to increase the weight reduction possibility. The purpose of the present study is to establish and evaluate the design of the tapered inner surface railway axle. The case study and Finite Element Method(FEM) are applied to evaluate the strength of the lightweight railway axle according to the European Norm(EN 13103).
