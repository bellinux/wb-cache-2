5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of investigations of the influence of vehicle age on traffic <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission.</b> The measurements of the test group of 500 different vehicles have been made in accordance with ECE Regulations and the methodology of periodical car inspection. Those measurements provided information about the level of emission from each vehicle and allowed to identify high polluting vehicles. The percentage of faulty vehicles and the type of faults were estimated. Next, the percentage of high polluting vehicles has been estimated. The results of investigations were compared to the requirements of each model of a given year. The percentage of high polluting vehicles for each model of a given year has been presented. The vehicles have been divided into different <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> legislation classes. The percentage of high polluting vehicles for each <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> legislation class has been elaborated. Next, the relation between <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> and the vehicle age has been made and presented. The probability of exceeding the standardized <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> for each model of a given year of vehicles has been calculated. The calculations included the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. The likelihood of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emission violations have been estimated applying logit analysis.

It has been found that the steady speed–based CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> rate is based on (1) CO 2 dissociation, (2) the water–gas shift reaction, and (3) the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon.

It has also been found that the steady speed–based CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> rate based on the water–gas shift reaction is the dominant source of CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission.</b> The study shows that the average percentage of deviation of the steady speed–based simulated results from the corresponding field data is 1. 7 % for all freeway cycles with 99 % coefficient of determination at the confidence level of 95 %.

40|$|Abstract: The {{combustion}} and <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> {{characteristics were}} investigated in an DME fueled HCCI engine. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas, which {{was composed of}} carbon dioxide and nitrogen, were used as control parameters of combustion and <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission.</b> As the oxygen concentration in induction air, which was occurred by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas, was reduced, the start of auto-ignition was retarded and the burn duration was extended due to obstruction of combustion and reduction of combustion temperature. Due to these fact, indicated mean effective pressure was increased and indicated combustion efficiency was decreased by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas. In case of <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission,</b> hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide was increased by reduction of oxygen concentration in induction air.
