25|$|In April 2012, it was {{reported}} that Friedkin was suing Universal and Paramount over the domestic rights of Sorcerer for a share of the movie's profits. In a July 2012 interview, Friedkin said that the film's case was pending at the Ninth District Court of Appeals in California with a settlement to be announced by November 26. Had no settlement been reached by that time, the jury would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a trial date for March 2013. The director emphasized that his intent is not dictated by profits but by the desire to have it released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as having a film print for various outlets, such as film societies and universities. He also highlighted that if this case becomes precedential, he wishes it would help other pictures in a similar situation.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E

Despite their initial dislike the two character share more screen time and bond. They develop banter and a fun working relationship.

This creates a [...] "love triangle" [...] scenario and Oliver and Seb compete for her attention.|$|E

2500|$|Other issues {{threatened}} {{to raise the}} cost of the hotel and put its viability in question as well. A new sticking point was how many rooms the hotel would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> aside each night for convention business. Marriott and its finance partners wanted fewer rooms dedicated to convention business so that its operating margins would be higher. Marriott also wanted to build multiple mid-size meeting rooms rather a few large ballrooms. No agreement had been reached on these issues by February 2007, despite several months of negotiations. However, the two sides did agree that the underground portion of the hotel would include a [...] meeting center that would include at least one ballroom and multiple meeting rooms. The long negotiations were, according to RLJ Development executives, leading to higher costs and could lead Marriott and its partners to ask for more public money. The negotiations did not seem to impede construction, however. Construction on the hotel was scheduled to begin in early 2010 in time for a late 2011 opening.|$|E
2500|$|After scoring both Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, Brian Tyler {{was rumored}} {{for several months}} to be scoring The Avengers sequel , before officially signing on to the film in March 2014. He said that his {{template}} for the film was game changing scores such as those for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, feeling that [...] "You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score, ultimately receiving co-composer credit. On working with Elfman, Tyler said, [...] "The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, {{and that was something}} we worked really hard on doing." [...] Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly. Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for Age of Ultron [...] "than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie you really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> everyone up".
