This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When <b>implementing</b> multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows <b>implementing</b> each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows <b>implementing</b> the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E

Micro wind and Xilinx simulator <b>implements</b> SRAM design architecture and performs efficient simulation. These simulators <b>implements</b> high performances and low {{power consumption}} of SRAM design. SRAM efficiency analyzed with 6 -T architecture design and row/column based architectural design. We have analyzed clock <b>implemented</b> memory design and simulated with specific application. We have <b>implemented</b> clock based SRAM architecture that improves the internal clock efficiency of SRAM. Architectural Clock <b>implemented</b> memory design reduces the propagation delay and access time. Internal semiconductor material design <b>implemented</b> technique also improves the SRAM data transitions scheme. Semiconductor material and clock <b>implemented</b> design improve simulation performance of SRAM and these design <b>implements</b> for recently developed Application Specific Memory Design Architecture and mobile devices...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{ability of}} tillage <b>implements</b> to {{maintain}} surface residue coverage is largely {{dependent on the}} <b>implement’s</b> main active component. Two categories of tillage <b>implements</b> were compared to determine their ability to maintain grain sorghum (non–fragile) surface residue coverage when operating at two different tillage depths for fall and spring tillage. Chisel–type <b>implements</b> were found to bury substantially less crop residue than disk–type <b>implements.</b> Disk–type <b>implements</b> were found to bury increased amounts of crop residue when operating at deeper tillage depths. Fall and spring tillage were also found to leave equivalent amounts of percent residue cover and total mass of crop residue remaining on the soil surface. A more thorough understanding of the ability of tillage <b>implements</b> to maintain adequate amounts of surface residue coverage should enable producers to select appropriate <b>implements</b> to maximize production while minimizing erosion...|$|R

Staffs, which also function as weapons, are used by druids, invokers, sorcerers and wizards. Totems are used by druids and shamans. Wands are used by bards, warlocks and wizards. Holy symbols are used by Avengers, Clerics and Paladins; unlike other <b>implements,</b> a character can benefit from a holy symbol by wearing it rather than needing to wield it. Orbs are used by wizards and musical instruments are used by bards. Sorcerers can use daggers as <b>implements,</b> and swordmages can use any weapon in the light and heavy blade groups, and certain paragon paths such as Wizard of the Spiral Tower can use specific weapon types as <b>implements.</b> Additionally, some magic weapons, such as Holy Avengers (for paladins), Pact Blades (for warlocks) and Songblades (for bards), function as <b>implements.</b> The July 2008 Playtest version of the Artificer uses orbs, rods, staffs and wands as <b>implements.</b>|$|R
