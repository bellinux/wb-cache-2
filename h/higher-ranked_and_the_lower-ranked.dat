40|$|We {{consider}} a college admissions problem with uncertainty. We realistically assume that (i) students' college application choices are nontrivial because applications are costly, (ii) college rankings {{of students are}} noisy and thus uncertain {{at the time of}} application, and (iii) matching between colleges and students takes place in a decentralized setting. We analyze a general equilibrium model where two ranked colleges set admissions standards for student quality signals, and students, knowing their types, decide where to apply to. We show that the optimal student application portfolio need not be monotone in types, and we construct a robust example to show that this can lead to a failure of assortative matching in equilibrium. More importantly, we prove that a unique equilibrium with assortive matching exists provided application costs are small <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower-ranked</b> college has sufficiently high capacity. We also provide equilibrium comparative static results with respect to college capacities and application costs. We apply the model to the question of race-based admissions policiesmatching, directed search, noise...|$|R

Names are extracted using a learning algorithm that filters adjacent capitalized words and runs it through a database of non-names grown through training. The number of mentions of individual names shows strong temporal fluctuations, indicative {{of the nature of}} "hot" trends and issues in society. Despite these strong variations, however, we observe stable rank-frequency distributions across different years in the form of power-laws with scaling exponents α = 0. 7, reminiscent of the Zipf's law observed in lexical (i. e. non-name) words. Additionally, we observe that the adjusted frequency for each rank, or the frequency divided by the number of unique names having the same rank, shows a distribution with dual scaling behavior, with the higher-ranked names preserving <b>the</b> α exponent <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower-ranked</b> ones showing a power-law exponent α' = 2. 9.

50|$|For the 1976-77 Stanley Cup playoff tournament, the {{top three}} teams in each {{division}} were awarded playoff berths. These twelve teams were then ranked 1 through 12 according to their regular season records, irrespective of divisional affiliation. The four division winners automatically qualified for the quarterfinals, while the remaining eight teams (2nd and 3rd place teams in each division) played a preliminary round. For the preliminary round, the top-ranked non-division winner played the twelfth-ranked team, the second top ranked non-division winner played the eleventh-ranked team, the third ranked non-division winner played the third-lowest ranked non-division winner. (This did not necessarily {{have to be the}} tenth-ranked team, as it was possible for a tenth-ranked team to win its division.

40|$|Bidirectional typechecking {{has become}} a popular {{technique}} for advanced type systems. In this paper, I show how to extend past work on bidirectional typechecking to handle parametric polymorphism bidirectionally. The first key contribution is a simple bidirectional type system that supports first-class (<b>higher-rank</b> <b>and</b> impredicative) polymorphism; its algorithm is complete for predicative polymorphism (including ML-style polymorphism <b>and</b> <b>higher-rank</b> polymorphism). <b>The</b> second key contribution extends that system with subtyping; the combination of bidirectional typechecking with intersection and union types fortuitously yields a simple but fairly powerful algorithm. Both of these systems, inspired by Cardelli’s early work on System F<:, rely on a “greedy ” method for finding polymorphic instances. Finally, I present a more powerful algorithm that forms intersections and unions automatically. ...|$|R

In reality if one of the two top-ranked gyōji has his decision as to the victor of a bout overturned by the judges then he is expected to tender his resignation instead. However, the resignation is generally rejected by the Chairman of the Japan Sumo Association. A tate-gyōjis submission of his resignation can usually be regarded as simply a gesture of apology from one of the highest-ranked referees for his mistake. There have, however, been rare cases where the resignation has been accepted, or where the gyōji concerned has been suspended from duty for a short period.|$|R
50|$|A furigoma 振り駒 'piece toss' is used {{to decide}} who moves first. One of the players tosses five pawns. If the number of tokins (promoted pawns, と) facing up is higher than unpromoted pawns (歩), then the player who tossed the pawns plays gote 後手 'white' (that is, they have the second move). Among amateur tournaments, the higher-ranked player or {{defending}} champion also performs the piece toss. In professional games, the furigoma is done on the behalf of the higher-ranked player/champion by the timekeeper who kneels {{by the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>higher-ranked</b> player <b>and</b> tosses <b>the</b> pawn pieces onto a silk cloth.
