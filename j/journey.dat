5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, <b>Journey.</b> <b>Journey</b> was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in <b>Journey</b> Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. <b>Journey</b> {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of survey research data evaluating <b>Journeys,</b> a placebased environmental education teacher inservice training program developed and administered by Teton Science School. Information gleaned from stakeholder interviews was used to develop the specific evaluation questions. A self-administered mail survey was then sent to all teachers known to have received <b>Journeys</b> training. Nearly all trained teachers go on to use <b>Journeys</b> with their classes, and show a commitment to making <b>Journeys</b> a permanent part of their classroom. Teachers generally agreed that their involvement with <b>Journeys</b> has had positive effects on their teaching behaviors and attitudes towards teaching. In particular, <b>Journeys</b> increased their enthusiasm for teaching and their effectiveness as teachers. Teachers believe their involvement with <b>Journeys</b> has increased their students 2 ̆ 7 enthusiasm for learning, helped them learn about their place, and helped them connect to their place. <b>Journeys</b> {{appears to be an}} effective interdisciplinary program, helping teachers teach a variety of different subjects. The most significant barriers to implementing <b>Journeys</b> are a lack of time to conduct activities or to prepare for <b>Journeys</b> activities. Answers for open-ended questions revealed that many of the program support components such as site visits, materials provided, and additional follow-up workshops are largely responsible for the popularity of <b>Journeys.</b> <b>Journeys</b> teachers show a strong affinity for the program 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy, though it is unclear what specifically is attractive about this philosophy. <b>Journeys</b> appears to be most effective with K- 3 teachers. This thesis supports the notion that place-based approaches to environmental education teacher inservice training are effective. This thesis also provides information {{that can be used to}} further develop the <b>Journeys</b> program, and contributes to the literature on place-based education and teacher training in Environmental Education...|$|R

5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} the <b>journey</b> {{of the soul}} from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole <b>journey</b> is a <b>journey</b> of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its <b>journey</b> in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E

40|$|Attempts to {{elucidate}} {{the kinds of}} “thing” or “things” to which the term shamanic <b>journeying</b> image is referentially linked must grapple with two related questions: what is the fundamental nature of shamanic <b>journeying</b> images, and how might the origin of a shamanic <b>journeying</b> image be found? The first question is ontological, concerned with the nature and essence of shamanic <b>journeying</b> images. In contrast, the second is epistemological and methodolgical, concerned with how to acquire knowledge of shamanic <b>journeying</b> images. We demonstrate how inductive and deductive reasoning, the private language argument, and reification render problematic the resolution of both. Finally, we present a method to preliminarily formulate an ontology and epistemology of shamanic <b>journeying</b> imagery...|$|R
