Relying on a comprehensive approach that captures the compensation committee quality based on different attributes (i. e. independence, interlocking directorates, directors appointed by minorities) we conduct a two-step empirical analysis. First, we illustrate the evolution over time of the stock option plan characteristics and construct an illustrative diagram that shows the linkages between the attributes of the compensation committee quality and {{the elements of the}} option plans.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{a dynamic}} game model {{to analyze the}} fraud information disclosure by listed companies in China since the share-splitting reform in 2005. By analyzing the conditions of coalition-proof Nash equilibrium between large shareholders and the manager, exogenous variables’ effects on the equilibrium {{as well as the}} first-order condition of the maximum utility of the supervisory department, it is concluded that efficient capital markets require a high supervising probability and intensity of penalty to the “insider” and shortened the intervals between supervising conducts as well. Moreover, there exists a unique optimum <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> ratio over which fraud information disclosure becomes more rampant. This results in a higher intensity of penalty to the manager given more stock option incentive and, in contrast, a higher intensity of penalty to large shareholders of a well managed and efficiently capital-structured company once fraud information disclosure is detected. The model's conclusions are consistent with the facts of listed companies in China. Finally, the model makes sharp suggestions for the mechanism design of stock option incentive as well as suggestions for the supervisory department to achieve efficiency of capital markets in China...|$|E

50|$|The AMT was {{designed}} to prevent people from using loopholes in the tax law to avoid tax. However, the inclusion of unrealized gain on <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> imposes difficulties for people who cannot come up with cash to pay tax on gains {{that they have not}} realized yet. As a result, Congress has taken action to modify the AMT regarding <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b> In 2000 and 2001, people exercised <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> and held onto the shares, hoping to pay long-term capital gains taxes instead of short-term capital gains taxes. Many of these people were forced to pay the AMT on this income, {{and by the end of}} the year, the stock was no longer worth the amount of alternative minimum tax owed, forcing some individuals into bankruptcy. In the Nortel example given above, the individual would receive a credit for the AMT paid when the individual did eventually sell the Nortel shares. However, given the way AMT carryover amounts are recalculated each year, the eventual credit received is in many cases less than originally paid.|$|R

In addition, <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> (ISOs) are generally inferior to non-qualified <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> (NSOs).

50|$|One area {{of concern}} in early drafts of 409A was the impact on {{companies}} with stock that is not readily tradeable on an established securities market and these companies' employees. As of 2014, approximately 8.5 million American workers held <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b> Since options often vest and become taxable more than 1 year after they are granted, {{it would seem that}} 409A would apply to this as a form of deferred compensation. However, 409A specifically does not apply to <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> (ISOs) and non-qualified <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> (NSOs) granted at fair market value. However, if a company issues options to a service provider at a valuation below fair market value, section 409A will apply.

5000|$|The {{alternative}} {{minimum tax}} may apply to individuals exercising <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b> Under AMT rules, for <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> {{at the time of}} exercise, the [...] "bargain element" [...] or [...] "spread price" [...] (the difference between the strike price and fair market value) is treated as an AMT adjustment, and therefore needs {{to be added to the}} AMT calculation even though no ordinary income tax is due at the time of exercise. In contrast, under the regular tax rules capital gains taxes are not paid until the actual shares of stock are sold. For example, if someone exercised a 10,000 share Nortel <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> at $7 when the stock price was at $87, the bargain element was $80 per share or $800,000. Without selling the stock, the stock price dropped to $7. Although the real gain is $0, the $800,000 bargain element still becomes an AMT adjustment, and the taxpayer owes around $200,000 in AMT.|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the design of {{compensation}} contracts, we encourage researchers to relax the assumption that manager salaries consist exclusively of a fixed and a variable part. The different tax effects on salary components such as <b>incentive</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options,</b> severance payments or pensions on both the headquarters’ and the manager’s objective could yield additional insights for the design of optimal compensation packages in the presence of wage taxation. We also encourage researchers to study the possible consequences of the compensation risk reducing effect of wage taxation on the manager’s risk-taking behavior. Similar to the substitution with investment risk (Bauer and Kourouxous 2017), the decreased compensation risk could also be replaced with detection or litigation risk. If this is true, the costs for motivating the manager to engage in risky activities such as earnings management or tax evasion (e.g., Crocker and Slemrod 2005) would depend on wage taxes.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{valuation}} of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> {{from the perspective of}} an employee exhibiting preferences as described by cumulative prospect theory (CPT). In addition, it elaborates on their incentives effect and some implications in terms of design aspects. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on the CPT framework to derive a continuous time model of the <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> subjective value using the certainty equivalence principle. Numerical simulations are used in order {{to analyze the}} subjective value sensitivity with respect to preferences-related parameters and to investigate the incentives effect. Findings – Consistent with a growing body of empirical and experimental studies, the model predicts that the employee may overestimate the value of his options in-excess of their risk-neutral value. Moreover, for typical setting of preferences parameters around the experimental estimates, and assuming the company is allowed to adjust existing compensation when making new <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> grants, the model predicts that incentives are maximized for strike prices set around the stock price at inception. This finding is consistent with companies’ actual compensation practices. Finally, the model predicts that an executive who is subject to probability weighting may be more prompted than a risk-neutral executive to act in order to increase the firm's assets volatility. Originality/value – This research proposes an alternative theoretical framework for the analysis of pay-to-performance sensitivity of equity-based compensation that takes into account a number of prominent patterns of employee behavior that expected utility theory cannot explain. It contributes to recent empirical and theoretical researches that have advanced CPT framework as a promising candidate for the analysis of equity-based compensation contracts.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} the <b>incentives</b> from <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> for loss-averse employees subject to probability weighting. Employing the certainty equivalence principle, I built on insights from Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to derive a continuous time model to value options {{from the perspective}} of a representative employee. Consistent with a growing body of empirical and experimental studies (Lambert and Larcker, 2001; Hodge et al., 2006), the model predicts that the employee may overestimate the value of his options in-excess of their risk-neutral value. This is nevertheless in stark contrast with a common finding of standard models based on the Expected Utility Theory (EUT) framework that options value to a risk-averse undiversified employee is strictly lower than the value to risk-neutral outside investors. In particular, I proved that loss aversion and probability weighting have countervailing effects on the option subjective value. In addition, for typical setting of preferences parameters around the experimental estimates (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992; Abdellaoui, 2000), and assuming the company is allowed to adjust existing compensation when making new <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> grants, the model predicts that incentives are maximized for strike prices set around the stock price at inception. This finding is consistent with companies' actual compensation practices that standard EUT-based models have difficulties accommodating their existence.

40|$|T he most {{pronounced}} change in corporate compensation practices overthe past decade is the escalation and recent decline in executive andemployee <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b> In 1992, rms in the Standard & Poor’s 500 granted their employees options worth {{a total of}} $ 11 billion {{at the time of}} grant; by 2000, option grants in S&P 500 rms increased to $ 119 billion. 1 In 2002, option grants in the S&P 500 fell to $ 71 billion, well below their peak, but still a six-fold increase from a decade earlier. Despite—or perhaps because of—their growing importance, employee <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> have become increasingly controversial. The main argument in favor of <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> plans is that they give executives a greater incentive to act in the interests of shareholders by providing a direct link between realized compensation and company stock price performance.
