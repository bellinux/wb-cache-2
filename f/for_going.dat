5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be {{the inability of the}} church to fulfill individual spiritual needs. This is said to be shown through many of Joan's encounters with the church; as a girl she is scolded <b>for</b> <b>going</b> to confession too often, denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take it herself, and during her trial, where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{was awarded}} the Order of Canada in 1981, the country's highest {{civilian}} honour. Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae, to whom he had been married since 1944. His main reason <b>for</b> <b>going</b> back to the UK was to attempt, unsuccessfully, to produce a drama series about the Bloomsbury Group for the new Channel 4 network.|$|E

5|$|Live & Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children's {{magazine}} programme, {{running from}} 1993 to 2001. The fourth in {{a succession of}} Saturday morning shows, it was the replacement <b>for</b> <b>Going</b> Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show eventually {{came to an end}} in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Live & Kicking was {{conceived}} as a replacement <b>for</b> <b>Going</b> Live!, a successful Saturday morning programme that had been running for six years. It was first broadcast on 2 October 1993 at 9am on BBC1. The original hosts were Andi Peters, Emma Forbes who had presented a cookery segment in Going Live!, and John Barrowman. For the second series, John was relegated to host the showbiz Electric Circus segment, leaving Andi and Emma to become the main hosts. He left after one series of Electric Circus to concentrate on acting. Comedy duo Trevor and Simon and Peter Simon, in the Run the Risk segment, were also regulars who had featured on Going Live!.|$|E

2500|$|Searle {{extended}} his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena {{by trying to}} understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g. [...] "we're <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a walk") is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a walk with him and I think he thinks he's <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a walk with me and he thinks I think I'm <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a walk with him and ...").|$|R

5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and <b>for</b> <b>going</b> immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E

He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold.

5|$|When Operation Bagration {{commenced}} in the Vitebsk {{region on}} 22 June 1944, {{it was decided}} that female snipers would be withdrawn.

Although her request was refused, she went anyway. Shanina was later sanctioned <b>for</b> <b>going</b> to the front line without permission, but did not face a court martial. She wanted to be attached to a battalion or a reconnaissance company, turning to the commander of the 5th Army, Nikolai Krylov. Shanina also wrote twice to Joseph Stalin with the same request.|$|E

Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father <b>for</b> <b>going</b> to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date <b>for</b> <b>going</b> to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E

5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and <b>for</b> <b>going</b> to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans <b>for</b> <b>going</b> forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E
