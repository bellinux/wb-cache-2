40|$|The {{effect of}} Nb on the {{hardenability}} of ultra-thin cast strip (UCS) steels produced via the unique regime of rapid solidification, large austenite grain size, and <b>inclusion</b> <b>engineering</b> of the CASTRIP© process was investigated. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed for 0, 0. 014, 0. 024, 0. 04, 0. 06 and 0. 08 wt% Nb containing UCS steels. Phase nomenclature for {{the identification of}} lower transformation product in low carbon steels was reviewed. Even a small addition of 0. 014 wt% Nb showed a potent effect on hardenability, shifting the ferrite C-curve {{to the right and}} expanding the bainitic ferrite and acicular ferrite phase fields. Higher Nb additions increased hardenability further, suppressed the formation of ferrite to even lower cooling rates, progressively lowered the transformation start and finish temperatures and promoted the transformation of bainite instead of acicular ferrite. The latter was due to Nb suppressing the formation of allotriomorphic ferrite and allowing bainite to nucleate at prior austenite grain boundaries, a lower energy site than that for the intragranular nucleation of acicular ferrite at inclusions. Strength and hardness increased with increasing Nb additions, largely due to microstructural strengthening and solid solution hardening, but not from precipitation hardening...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A {{major concern}} {{nowadays}} {{is the social}} responsibility of engineers and what nature of actions the universities should take {{in order to help}} the creation of a genuine social dimension on the students ’ curriculum. Aiming to address this endeavor, a program called “Poli Cidadã ” was developed at the Escola Politécnica of University of São Paulo. The main goal is to foster the creation of opportunities for engineering students to develop their course projects, based on requests from different non-profitable organizations, which work with underprivileged classes or groups with special needs. This paper presents how the program creates the interaction between the non-profit organizations, the University and different sectors of the society in order to provide conditions for the development of engineering projects. Some projects have the support of private companies through the non-profit organizations. In addition, noteworthy examples of projects were given including one involving indigenous communities and another developed for some Brazilian slams. The experience has been very successful, allowing the students to interact with realities far different from their own and also to provide solutions to social segments that could not afford high-qualified professionals to mend some of their daily problems.

40|$|Manganese-containing oxysulphides {{can be used}} to {{minimise}} the {{detrimental effects}} of oxide inclusions and to improve mechanical properties of steel products, like ductility, fatigue strength and machinability. The effective utilization of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions requires an accurate control on their characteristics, e. g. chemistry, microstructure, size distribution and morphology. Therefore a deep understanding of their formation and behaviour during desulphurisation, deoxidation and alloying is necessary for a complete manipulation of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions. In {{the first part of the}} research, the desulphurisation and inclusion behaviour of stainless steel refining were investigated by using CaO-Al 2 O 3 based top slags. Although a relatively lower sulphide capacity was obtained for an optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag (50 % CaO, 40. 4 % Al 2 O 3, 4. 3 % SiO 2, 2. 1 % Fe 2 O 3, 1. 7 % TiO 2 and 0. 6 % MgO) compared to current CaO-SiO 2 -CaF 2 slag, an equivalent desulphurisation efficiency and an improved steel cleanliness were obtained with this optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag. Based on these results, the substitution of current CaO-CaF 2 based slag with CaO-Al 2 O 3 based slag for stainless steel refining was discussed and evaluated. In the second part of the work, the interfacial reaction between molten steel and Mn/FeMnSi alloys at the early stages of deoxidation/alloying were studied with a metal suction method. A layer of Fe solidified around the cold alloy immediately after alloy addition. While enclosed by this Fe shell, the alloy was partially molten due to its low melting temperature. The oxysulphide inclusions were formed at the Mn-rich side of the interface, while an inclusion free zone was detected in the Fe-rich side close to the interface. Based on experimental findings and theoretical calculations, the mechanisms governing the Fe/Mn (or Fe/FeMnSi) interdiffusion and the inclusion free zone formation were proposed. Steel alloying, such as Mn, Al, FeSi and FeMn additions to the liquid steel with different oxygen and sulphur content was also simulated with a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with a special addition device. The effects of the sulphur and oxygen content in liquid iron, as well as that of the deoxidant type on the formation of oxides/oxysulphides were investigated. The inclusion behaviour on the liquid iron surface, i. e. the interaction after inclusion formation, the dissolution during the high temperature iso-thermal holding and growth during the cooling were observed. This part of the work contributes to the optimisation (or manipulation) of deoxidation/alloying operations to control the formation and characteristics of Mn-containing inclusions.

30|$|The {{discipline}} that has dominated discussions about STEM education is engineering, {{as noted by}} national reform documents and standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013; NRC, 2012). The <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> presents several advantages for increasing student learning (Brophy, Klein, Portsmore, & Rogers, 2008; Hirsch, Carpinelli, Kimmel, Rockland, & Bloom, 2007; Koszalka, Wu, & Davidson, 2007). A lesson or unit that includes engineering can (1) provide a real-world context to students, (2) support students’ problem-solving skills in that context, and (3) promote student communication skills and teamwork. Further, the incorporation of engineering as a context to teach science content has potential to increase both student learning and interest (Harwell et al., 2015; National Academy of Engineering & National Research Council, 2009). Despite the attention that engineering has received in K- 12 education, this is still seen as an area that deserves further investigation, as imagining what STEM integration looks like in practice, especially {{with respect to the}} <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering,</b> has been a challenge (English, 2016; Herschbach, 2011).|$|R

30|$|Among {{the several}} STEM-related {{coursework}} in high school, we particularly chose {{to focus on}} the CTE-STEM pathway out of two reasons. First, the CTE-STEM pathway includes the most explicit <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> and technology courses, whereas the science, mathematics, and computer science pathways do not specifically require engineering courses for their completion. Second, CTE courses are designed to address students, who are more interested in entering the workforce after their high school degree.

30|$|By using a {{combination}} of definitions, we provide flexibility in defining integrated STEM while valuing both the integration between two or more of the disciplines and the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> to contextualize learning.

40|$|Backround: In recent years, {{national}} {{reports in}} both Australia and the United States {{have called for}} {{increasing the number of}} engineers as a means of ensuring national prosperity. Both countries have also identified that this goal begins with primary and secondary schools through both increasing the number of students with the required science and mathematics abilities to be successful in engineering and developing programs to introduce students to engineering. While technology education has long {{been a part of the}} school curricula of both countries, the formal <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> represents a relatively recent phenomenon. The development and definition of pre-college engineering is rapidly changing in both countries, presenting numerous opportunities to learn from comparisons of the approaches taken in Australia and the United States. Purpose: To explore the similarities and differences in the treatment of pre-college engineering in the USA and Australia. Design/Method: This research is based on reviews of national and state reports addressing pre-college engineering education in Australia and the United States. We compare how engineering content is being incorporated into national and state curriculum frameworks. Finally, we review the different types and providers of pre-college engineering activities, and explore the <b>inclusion</b> of pre-college <b>engineering</b> in the engineering education research community of each country. Results: Similarities exist across the two countries in focusing on the shortage of engineers in the labour market and the role that engineers play in maintaining national security and prosperity. There is variation in the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> in the educational programs of different states. However, the United States has a more developed pre-college engineering ecosystem, including a greater presence in the engineering education community. Conclusions: Based on the results of this research, a tremendous opportunity exists for the Australian engineering education community to bring a greater research focus on P- 12 engineering activities. Many states in Australia have developed 11 th and 12 th year engineering courses that could serve as a model for schools in the United States interested in implementing similar programs. Finally, national curriculum frameworks affecting engineering are in the process of being revised in both countries, which will have a significant effect on P- 12 engineering in the schools in upcoming years...|$|R

30|$|One aspect {{that remains}} {{in need of}} greater {{attention}} is the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> experiences in STEM curricula, especially at the elementary level, even though the contributions of engineering have been well documented.

40|$|Developing and {{implementing}} {{a plan for}} a NASA space mission can be a complicated process.

Full Abstract: The goal of the paper is to provide a commentary on the level of interaction between business faculty and engineering faculty, in the design and delivery of engineering programs, and the results of that interaction. To this end a taxonomy of engineering enlightenment is proposed, and this is used to discuss evidence of broadening within Irish engineering curricula.

30|$|Science, technology, engineering, and {{mathematics}} (STEM) education {{is becoming more}} prevalent at the elementary level, and recent national reports {{have called for a}} change in how these disciplines are taught with an emphasis on the integration between the STEM disciplines (National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council 2009; 2011; 2012; 2014).

Elementary classrooms, therefore, provide a powerful environment for STEM implementation and learning. However, how teachers conceptualize, interpret, and subsequently enact STEM content and engineering impacts the learning experiences they provide in their classrooms (Diefes-Dux 2014). Therefore, it becomes imperative that we investigate how to better support teachers as they conceptualize integrated STEM and incorporate engineering-based STEM experiences into their elementary classrooms.|$|R

40|$|Education {{is always}} {{changing}} and science education is no exception, with many influential publications passing through science education over the years. The latest wave in science standards {{is called the}} Next Generation Science Standards. The Next Generation Science Standards are anticipated {{to have a significant}} effect on state science standards around the entire country. One thing about these new standards is very different from all previous science standards—they include the principle of engineering design in them. Asking science teachers to teach engineering design is asking them to teach a principle for which their teaching licensure would not have formally prepared them. Consequently, the hypothesis of this study was that the feeling of preparedness to teach engineering design would be low among public secondary education Utah science teachers. This study shows that hypothesis to be correct: Utah science teachers do not feel prepared to teach engineering design. The feelings of teacher preparedness can be improved through professional development and <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> design into science teacher education programs. It should be infused into these arenas now that teachers have indicated their low feelings of preparedness. More teacher preparation should be sought because an unprepared teacher will not prepare students as well as a prepared teacher. And, creating prepared students is the goal of the education system...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of this material has been partially supported by Grant NSF-GE 2564 made to Cornell University by the National Science Foundation"Engineering Mathematics" by H. D. Block, E. T. Cranch, P. J. Hilton and R. J. Walker was a two volume work that was written, published and first used as a text at Cornell University in 1964. The project was a cooperative effort between the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Department in the College of Engineering and the Mathematics Department in the College of Arts and Sciences. The work was very novel at the time, although many of its innovations have become commonplace nowadays. In particular, the work involved {{the unusual step of}} interweaving linear algebra and differential equations (both ordinary and partial). Also unusual was the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>engineering</b> applications and computer simulations. Related topics such as vector field theory, complex numbers and infinite series were also treated. The book continued to be used as the text for a year-long sequence of sophomore engineering mathematics, Math 293 - 294, well into the 1970 's. Eventually other authors produced books which combined linear algebra and differential equations, and "Engineering Mathematics" by Block et al. ceased {{to be used as a}} text at Cornell...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine student perceptions on the efficacy of using mobile learning strategies and devices to create electronic content for <b>inclusion</b> in an <b>engineering</b> individual e-portfolio. Students enrolled in an undergraduate 300 -level engineering Thermodynamics class, created multimedia videos and produced content demonstrating course content summaries, problem solving techniques, and written work on concept question solutions. A post course completion anonymous survey and focus group meeting was conducted at the end of the semester, to document student perceptions on the efficacy of using mobile learning strategies and devices to create electronic content for <b>inclusion</b> in an <b>engineering</b> individual e-increased interaction with the instructor. Students reported that the act of creating videos portfolio. Results indicated that most students found using mobile devices to create content for verbalizing and demonstrating each step of a problem solution helped review course their e-portfolios increased engagement with content though it did not necessarily lead to materials, to think deeply and to retain information for future use. The e-portfolio was not used as an interaction venue between the students and the instructor and most students found it easier to contact the instructor face-to-face. Several advantages and disadvantages of using mobile devices were noted. Students expressed interest in using mobile devices for learning in future, and suggested changes for ways in which mobile devices can be used in future engineering classes...|$|R
