5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. <b>Ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. <b>Ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E
5|$|At only 5,000 {{years of}} age, the Everglades {{is a young}} region in {{geological}} terms. Its <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> in constant flux {{as a result of}} the interplay of three factors: the type and amount of water present, the geology of the region, and the frequency and severity of fires.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} abiotic and biotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ecosystem</b> ecology <b>is</b> an {{inherently}} interdisciplinary field of study. An individual <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> composed of populations of organisms, interacting within communities, {{and contributing to}} the cycling of nutrients and the flow of energy. The <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.|$|R
30|$|A digital {{entrepreneurship}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> an <b>ecosystem</b> where {{digital entrepreneurship}} emerges and develops. Because an ecosystem can facilitate {{the integration of}} resources and supportive elements beyond the firm-level, a digital entrepreneurship <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> important {{for the success of}} digital entrepreneurship (Spigel, 2015). If we treat digital entrepreneurship as characterized by individualism, we can then see a DEE, in which various resources and elements can be integrated to facilitate the process of digital entrepreneurship, as a kind of collectivism. Another related concept is “digital ecosystem”, or “digital business ecosystem”. Per Corallo et al. 2007, a digital <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> defined as the ICT enabling infrastructure that supports the cooperation, the knowledge sharing and the building of a business ecosystem. A digital business <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> based on digital business, while a digital entrepreneurship <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> based on digital entrepreneurship.|$|R
50|$|This <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> most {{commonly}} affected by fire and grazing. Before human presence, the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>was</b> maintained by {{a pattern of}} disturbance caused by natural wildfire and grazing by bison, a pattern which is called pyric herbivory.|$|R
5|$|In {{parts of}} its range, {{such as the}} Harboi, these steppe <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> {{employed}} as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. P.atriplicifolia can serve as {{an important source of}} phosphorus and zinc, despite being high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin.|$|E
5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{disturbance}} within a tropical <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> fire. Since most nutrients in a tropical <b>ecosystem</b> <b>are</b> contained in the biomass of plants, fire is an important component of recycling these nutrients and therefore regenerating an ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|I want {{to relate}} {{a few things}} that struck me as I was {{listening}} to the presentations yesterday. One of the questions about <b>ecosystems</b> <b>is,</b> what are they? It seemed to me that most of the talks yesterday failed to address this question. I don 2 ̆ 7 t think I have an answer for it either, but it is a question that runs through the literature about <b>ecosystems.</b> What <b>are</b> they? Where are they? What are the boundaries around an ecosystem? Where does it start and where does it end? In some ways, ecosystems do not end anywhere. One way to think about <b>ecosystems</b> <b>is</b> through an operational definition. For example, IQ is what is measured by IQ tests. According to this approach, an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> whatever <b>is</b> managed by <b>ecosystem</b> management...|$|R
40|$|Mangrove <b>is</b> {{a coastal}} <b>ecosystem</b> that <b>is</b> {{vulnerable}} {{when it is}} exposed to oil spills. Cleaning up oil spills in mangrove <b>ecosystems</b> <b>is</b> very difficult and highly costly. Ecological sensitivity index (ESI) of mangrove <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> an alternative tool to control oil spill by protecting highly sensitive areas from oil spill. One of the problems found {{in the development of}} ecological sensitivity index (ESI) of mangrove <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> large numbers of variables of ecological sensitivity. Screening methods of variables can reduce the numbers of variables and result in the key variables of ecological sensitivity index (ESI) of mangrove ecosystems to oil spill. * Corresponding author...|$|R
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> just as vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil {{inches above the}} peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
40|$|Our present {{knowledge}} of the functional processes within the Kalahari <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> insufficient to provide a total understanding of the system. In this paper {{the uniqueness of the}} Kalahari <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> discussed, with special emphasis on its faunal and floristic components as well as the remarkable micro-ecosystems which are encountered...|$|R

30|$|Corallo et al. (2007), {{expanding}} on {{the metaphor}} of natural ecosystems, separate the concepts of digital ecosystem and business ecosystem by its core species. A digital <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> populated by digital species, while a business <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> populated by business species. Similarly, a DEE is populated by digital species while an entrepreneurship <b>ecosystem</b> <b>is</b> populated by entrepreneurship species. This can be confirmed by the definition of digital entrepreneurship {{and other types of}} entrepreneurship. Digital entrepreneurship pursues opportunities based on the use of digital technologies, while others pursue opportunities based on business, knowledge or institutions (Davidson and Vaast 2010).|$|R
5|$|<b>Ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> {{regularly}} {{confronted with}} natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). <b>Ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E

25|$|Fresh {{water is}} a {{renewable}} resource, yet the world's supply of groundwater is steadily decreasing, with depletion occurring most prominently in Asia, South America and North America, although it is still unclear how much natural renewal balances this usage, and whether <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> threatened. The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as water rights.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change is}} raising ocean {{temperatures}} and raising levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere. These rising levels of carbon dioxide are acidifying the oceans. This, in turn, is altering aquatic ecosystems and modifying fish distributions, with impacts on the sustainability of fisheries and the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them. Healthy ocean <b>ecosystems</b> <b>are</b> also important for the mitigation of climate change.|$|E
