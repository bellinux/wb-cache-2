5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the bay.|$|E

5|$|The name Joan was {{retired in}} 1989 and {{replaced}} by Joyce on the list for the 1994 season. The name will never again {{be used for a}} North Atlantic hurricane. Because the impact of the Miriam portion of the tropical cyclone was minimal, the name Miriam was not retired in the Pacific and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list of names for that basin, and was most recently used in the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the largest}} public radio networks, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and Public Radio International (PRI), are based in the state. MPR has the largest {{audience}} of any regional public radio network in the nation, broadcasting on 37 radio stations. PRI weekly provides more than 400 hours of programming to almost 800 affiliates. The state's oldest radio station, KUOM-AM, was launched in 1922 and is among the 10-oldest radio stations in the United States. The University of Minnesota-owned station <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air, and since 1993 broadcasts a college rock format.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E

5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most of Sierra Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road {{and in the process}} of being restored. The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it. Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.|$|E

25|$|When John R. Oughton died in 1925 his son {{took over}} the declining {{institute}}. In 1939 the institute celebrated its 60th anniversary. A ceremony which unveiled a commemorative plaque bearing the likenesses of Keeley, Oughton and Judd attracted 10,000 people. The plaque, designed by Florence Gray, a student of Lorado Taft, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds, complete with a time capsule. The Keeley Institute continued to operate until it definitively shut down in 1965.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, daytime {{programming}} {{was also}} revamped. While {{there were still}} repeats of CBC and foreign series, new talk shows such as The Gill Deacon Show and the regional franchise Living were added. The Gill Deacon Show was cancelled after just seven months, and replaced with another talk show, Steven and Chris, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air today (Steven and Chris is also shown on the Live Well Network in the United States); Living was cancelled in August 2009.|$|E
25|$|Just east of Alexandria {{in ancient}} times (where now is Abu Qir Bay) there was {{marshland}} and several islands. As early as 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water. Part of Canopus <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore above water, and had been studied by archaeologist the longest. There was also the town of Menouthis. The Nile Delta had long been politically significant as the point of entry for anyone wishing to trade with Egypt.|$|E

The ship's inhabitants are from Golgafrincham; they are unskilled workers in apparently pointless jobs, the people that the clever Golgafrinchams, the thinkers and the doers, back home wanted to get rid of.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{assessments}} {{have led}} to the classification of low molecular weight and labeling as Category 1B Reproductive agents. Three of these phthalates, DBP, BBP and DEHP were included on annex XIV of the REACH regulation in February 2011 and will be phased out by the EU by February 2015 unless an application for authorisation is made before July 2013 and an authorisation granted. DIBP <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> REACH Candidate List for Authorisation. Environmental Science & Technology, a peer reviewed journal published by the American Chemical Society states DEHP poses a serious risk to human health.|$|E
25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E
