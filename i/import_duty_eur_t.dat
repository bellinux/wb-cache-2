30|$|Firstly, Taiwan’s exports will be {{severely}} disadvantaged {{in regard to}} tariffs (Chinese National Federation of Industries 2015). Approximately 35 % of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector export products are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> in TPP member economies, with products liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> of more than 5 % representing approximately 13 % of Taiwan’s total exports. In the Chilean, Australian and Vietnamese markets, more than 60 % of Taiwan’s export product items are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty,</b> in most cases {{at a rate of}} 5 % or higher. Overall, tariff barriers in the US market are not as high as in the ASEAN member states; however, the US ranks second highest among the TPP member economies in terms of the total value of Taiwan’s exports that are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis {{as to what}} extent countries {{have been able to}} recover revenue losses from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> due to trade liberalization policies through indirect taxes. In contrast to the existing literature, we identify major trade liberalization policies and explore their revenue effects. Specifically, we investigate how revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and consumption tax revenues change as a result over the course of GATT/WTO accession. Employing a robust difference-in-difference specification as well as non-parametric methods, our results reveal a substantial, statistically significant inverse relationship between GATT/WTO membership and <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> supporting concerns about revenue losses. At the same time, however, we find a significant increase in revenues from indirect taxes and VAT. Our findings indicate that countries joining GATT/WTO, including low income countries, have successfully substituted revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> with higher indirect taxes including VAT...|$|R

40|$|Using National Accounts {{data and}} static {{input-output}} analysis we assess {{the extent of}} shifting the incidence of Dutch <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> to foreign customers and global tariff incidence on final demands. About 70 % of the tariffs collected in the Netherlands are paid by foreign customers, mainly those in other EU-countries. While the Dutch export the incidence {{of most of the}} <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> that they collect, they also <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> levied elsewhere in the EU. Assessing tariff incidence globally we conclude that Dutch tariff incidence is in line with the incidence in the other member states of the European Union.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> to total <b>imports</b> {{is a widely}} used measure of tariff policy in growth empirics; {{as a matter of}} fact, however, no clear and robust {{relationship}} emerges from the statistical analysis linking such an index to growth. This failure may be explained by precise theoretical reasons. Total <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> are generated by different fiscal instruments, such as “ad valorem” and specific tariffs, which (according to the insights of R&D based endogenous growth models) exert completely different growth effects. As a consequence, the theoretical form of the relationship between <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and growth critically changes according to which kind of tariff barrier is mainly raised and no clear empirical link may be expected to emerge in a cross-section of economies characterized by sufficiently heterogeneous tariff policies...|$|R

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct preshipment inspections of imports, generating independent data on the value and tariff classification of incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.
