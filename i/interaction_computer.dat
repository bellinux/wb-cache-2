40|$|This paper extends {{techniques}} from affective {{psychology to}} show how cognitive models {{can be used to}} represent and reason about <b>interaction</b> with <b>computer</b> games. It is argued that this modeling activity provides insights into the motivational appeal that often distinguishes computer games from other forms of human <b>computer</b> <b>interaction.</b> The long-term aim behind this research is to use our improved understanding of <b>interaction</b> with <b>computer</b> games to inform the subsequent development of more general classes of interactive systems. Barnard's Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) is used throughout this paper. This decision is justified by the fact that ICS has already been applied to analyze the negative emotions surrounding clinical depression. This previous work provides a useful starting point for our investigation of the more positive emotions evoked during <b>interaction</b> with <b>computer</b> games. A further justification is that ICS has also been successfully used to represent and reason about the design of human computer interfaces...|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, as {{explained}} in a journal article discussing user modeling and user-adapted <b>interaction,</b> <b>computer</b> use was modeled as a human-computer dyad {{in which the two}} were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel, such as text-based terminals. Much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication. However, as stated in the introduction, there is much room for mishaps and failure. Because of these potential issues, human-computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by D. Engelbart: [...] "If ease of use was the only valid criterion, people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles." ...|$|E
