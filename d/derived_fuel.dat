25|$|A <b>derived</b> <b>fuel</b> is biochar, {{which is}} {{produced}} by biomass pyrolysis. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, biomass briquettes are being marketed {{as an alternative to}} charcoal to protect Virunga National Park from deforestation associated with charcoal production.|$|E
25|$|Some systems {{integrate}} a wet MRF {{to separate}} by density and flotation and to recover & wash the recyclable {{elements of the}} waste {{in a form that}} can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed refuse <b>derived</b> <b>fuel</b> (RDF). RDF can be used in cement kilns or thermal combustion power plants and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco Processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF. This is not the case and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{constitutes}} a master thesis (TFM), {{and its main}} objectives are to sort for conditions of sustainability in Catalonia; to develop sustainability at local level; to link oil <b>derived</b> <b>fuels</b> use with territorial aspects proposing an Oil <b>Derived</b> <b>Fuels</b> Dependence Index for Catalan Municipalities (ODFDICM); and presenting Oil <b>Derived</b> <b>Fuels</b> Vulnerability Maps as a results of the projections made for all Catalan municipalities. The data base donated by the Catalan Institute of Statistics (IDESCAT) was used to shape the Catalan Territory as a Geographical Information System study case (GIS). As a result the agrarian vulnerability maps were generated together with the industrial vulnerability maps for each sector of industrial activity; the domestic gas use vulnerability map; the mobility vulnerability map; the social labor distribution vulnerability maps; the forest vulnerability map {{in order to establish}} vulnerability zones for energy use. Since oil <b>derived</b> <b>fuels</b> are proved to be widely used in the industrial system, transport system, domestic sector, services sector, the proposition made was to create an INDEX that presents variation with those sectors.

40|$|Solid waste <b>derived</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are being}} {{increasingly}} considered for application in waste-to-energy processes. This thermal treatment methodology {{is becoming more}} popular since it deals with two major issues; the disposal of solid wastes {{and the production of}} a biomass-derived energy source. This paper is concerned with the analysis of a variety of waste <b>derived</b> <b>fuels</b> including mixed RDF, wood and paper, in comparison with coal. A specially designed chamber was developed to heat the fuels in an inert atmosphere whilst simultaneously measuring the internal temperatures of the pellets. The pellets were also tested for compressive strength, to determine how the devolatisation process affected the integrity of the pellets. Results showed that small RDF pellets devolatise very quickly in a high temperature environment, whereas larger paper pellets have far longer lifespans. Waste derived pellets lose structural integrity far quicker than coal-based fuels, which was identified as being linked to the composition of the materials and the mode by which they are held together...|$|R
