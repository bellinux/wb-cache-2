5|$|Analogue {{filters are}} a basic {{building}} block of signal processing much used in electronics. Amongst their many applications are the separation of an audio signal before application to bass, mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers; the combining and later separation of multiple telephone conversations onto a single channel; {{the selection of a}} chosen radio station <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> receiver and rejection of others.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, comedian Spede Pasanen asked Vainio and his friends to play <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> show called Ruljanssiriihi ("Thrashing House of Rigmarole").

They played in Pasanen's shows including Speden saluuna ("Spede's Saloon") and 50 pientä minuuttia ("50 Small Minutes").|$|E

5|$|A story arc from A Town Where You Live {{was adapted}} into an {{original}} video animation called A Town Where You Live: Twilight Intersection by Tatsunoko Production. Gonzo later adapted the series into an anime under its manga name; Gonzo's anime resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> program, drama CD, and an image song. Reception towards the manga was mixed with reviewers praising the plot for its realism or panning it as predictable and cliché.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1934, top {{officials}} of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels {{was present at the}} arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).|$|E

5|$|Horrible Histories {{received}} numerous {{domestic and}} international awards and nominations, including several BAFTA Children's Awards, two British Comedy Awards and a Rose d'Or Award for Best Children's Programme. It is the first children's programme to win a British Comedy Award and four successive children's BAFTAs, for Best Comedy. In 2013 the show was also named <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Radio</b> Times poll of all-time greatest British children's TV series, and was cited at No. 8 in a similar Top 50 list presented later the same year by Channel Five.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> {{address on}} May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|In his campaign, McCarthy {{attacked}} La Follette for not enlisting {{during the}} war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, {{had been away}} fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested {{in the stock market}} himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast on November 3, painting the {{race as a}} choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E
5|$|Sports Personality of the Year {{was created}} by Paul Fox, who thought of the idea while he was editor of the {{magazine}} show Sportsview. The first award ceremony took place in 1954 as part of Sportsview, and was presented by Peter Dimmock. For the first show, votes were sent by postcard, and rules presented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Radio</b> Times article stipulated that nominations were restricted to athletes who had featured on the Sportsview programme since April. Approximately 14,500 votes were cast, and Christopher Chataway beat Roger Bannister to win the inaugural BBC Sportsview's Personality of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Radioland Murders came from {{executive}} producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline {{of the film}} during the writing phase of American Graffiti, viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda jerks solving a murder <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American Graffiti in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio first look deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually {{became the basis for}} Star Wars).|$|E

5|$|Thunderbirds is {{generally}} considered the Andersons' most popular series and their greatest critical and commercial success. In 1966, the show received a Royal Television Society Silver Medal for Outstanding Artistic Achievement and Gerry Anderson received an honorary fellowship of the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society. In 2007, Thunderbirds achieved 19th place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Radio</b> Times magazine reader poll {{to determine the best}} science-fiction TV programme of all time. It is ranked fourth by the 2013 Channel 5 list show 50 Greatest Kids' TV Shows.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in Burnout 3. EA launched an initiative called EA TRAX in 2002 with the intent of including licensed tracks in all their games. Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again {{for more than a}} quarter of a century.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-1920s {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers Elders and Fyffes. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life. He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children. He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for Pelham Warner, at a centenary celebration for the Free Foresters Cricket Club and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday. Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill {{for the rest of the}} year; he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2 May 1963.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> program anyway.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary {{publicly}} split, {{with the}} former denouncing the latter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge {{and went on to}} form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced {{at the end of his}} visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit Samlout, another town located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.|$|E
