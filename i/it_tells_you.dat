500|$|The German word [...] "Achtung" [...] (...) in {{the album}} title {{translates}} into English as [...] "attention" [...] or [...] "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy {{used the phrase}} [...] "achtung baby" [...] during recording, reportedly taking it from the Mel Brooks film The Producers. The title was selected in August 1991 {{near the end of}} the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to [...] "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as [...] "The Fly". Of the title, Bono said in 1992, [...] "It's a con, in a way. We call it Achtung Baby, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... <b>It</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as Kullback–Leibler {{divergence}} of [...] "actual from ambient" [...] measures thermodynamic availability, Kullback–Leibler divergence of [...] "reality from a model" [...] is {{also useful}} {{even if the}} only clues we have about reality are some experimental measurements. In the former case Kullback–Leibler divergence describes distance to equilibrium or (when multiplied by ambient temperature) the amount of available work, while {{in the latter case}} <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> about surprises that reality has up its sleeve or, in other words, how much the model has yet to learn.|$|E
2500|$|Star CEO Uday Shankar {{stated that}} the IPL was a [...] "very {{powerful}} property", and that Star would [...] "remain very committed {{to make sure that}} the growth of sports in this country continues to be driven by the power of cricket". He went on to say that [...] "whoever puts in that money, they put in that money because they believe in the fans of the sport. The universe of cricket fans, <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> continues to very healthy, continues to grow. What was paid in 2008, that was 2008. India and cricket and IPL—all three have changed dramatically in the last 10 years. It is a reflection of that." [...] The deal led to concerns that Star India now held a monopoly on cricket rights in the country, as it is also the rightsholder of ICC competitions and the Indian national team.|$|E

60|$|But {{some may}} say, How then {{is this a}} prophecy? It merely tells us what good king Josiah was, and what every king ought to be. Well, my friends, that is just what makes it a prophecy.

60|$|Let me say a {{few words}} to you on this text. Be not anxious, <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> And why? Because you have to be prudent. In practice, {{fretting}} and anxiety help no man towards prudence. We must all be as prudent and industrious as we can; agreed. But does fretting make us the least more prudent? Does anxiety make us the least more industrious? On the contrary, I know nothing which cripples a man more, and hinders him working manfully, than anxiety. Look at the worst case of all--at a man who is melancholy, and fancies that all is going wrong with him, and that he must be ruined, and has a mind full of all sorts of dark, hopeless, fancies. Does he work any the more, or try to escape one of these dangers which he fancies are hanging over him? So far from it, he gives himself up to them without a struggle; he sits moping, helpless, and useless, and says, 'There is no use in struggling. If it will come, it must come.' He has lost spirit for work, and lost the mind for work, too. His mind is so full of these dark fears that he cannot turn it to laying any prudent plan to escape from the very things which he dreads.|$|E
