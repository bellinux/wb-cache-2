40|$|A failed main-on in the 35 <b>d</b> <b>cycle</b> of Her X- 1 was {{observed}} with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) on 1999 April 26. Exceptions {{to the normal}} 35 <b>d</b> <b>cycle</b> have been seen only twice before; in 1983 and again 1993. We present timing and spectral results of this latest Anomalous Low State (ALS) along with comparisons to the main-on and normal low states. Pulsations were observed in the 2. 5 - 20 keV band with a pulsed fraction of (4. 7 +- 0. 2) %. Spectral analysis indicates that the ALS spectrum has the same shape as the main-on but is modified by heavy absorption and scattering. We find that 70 % of the observed emission has passed through a cold absorber (nh= 5. 6 x 10 ^{ 23 } cm^{- 2 }). This partially absorbing spectral fit {{can be applied to}} the normal low state with similar results. We find that the ALS observations may be interpreted as a decrease in inclination of the accretion disk causing the central X-Ray source to be obscured over the entire 35 <b>d</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E

Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and taxane unless not suitable. This randomized, multicenter study compared efficacy and tolerability of two eribulin regimens administered sequentially with erlotinib in pts with advanced NSCLC {{to establish an}} optimal dosing schedule. METHODS: Pts (ECOG ≤ 2; ≥ 1 prior anti-cancer therapy for advanced NSCLC including ≥ 1 platinum-based therapy) received 2. 0 mg/m 2 eribulin mesilate (2 - 5 min IV) on Day (D) 1 and 150 mg oral erlotinib on D 2 - 16 (21 <b>D</b> <b>cycle),</b> or 1. 4 mg/m 2 eribulin mesilate on D 1 and D 8 and 150 mg erlotinib on D 15 - 28 (28 <b>D</b> <b>cycle).</b> Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarker (BM) assessment. RESULTS: 123 pts were treated (63 pts 21 <b>D</b> <b>cycle,</b> 60 pts 28 <b>D</b> <b>cycle).</b> Median age was 63 years (range 35 - 87), 53. 7 % male, 75. 6 % smokers, 65. 9 % stage IV disease and 91. 1 % ≥ 2 prior therapy for advanced NSCLC. ORR was 12. 7 % (21 D) and 16. 7 % (28 D); other efficacy parameters were also greater with the 28 <b>D</b> <b>cycle.</b> Concomitant administration of erlotinib did not affect eribulin exposure and was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. BM analysis supported overall results. CONCLUSIONS: Both regimens were associated with moderate activity in this heavily pre-treated population. The 28 D regimen appears to have greater activity and less toxicity than the 21 D. Disclosure: S.

40|$|ABSTRACT The lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis has an all-cone retina. In lizards {{maintained}} on a 12 -h light: 12 -h dark (12 L: 12 <b>D)</b> <b>cycle,</b> a {{burst of}} cone outer segment (COS) shedding occurs 2 h after light offset (1400 h circadian time) (Young, R. W., 1977, /. Ultrastruct. Res. 61 : 172 - 72). In this investigation, we studied the effect of different lighting regimes on the pattern of cone disk shedding in this species. When lizards entrained to a 121 -: 12 <b>D</b> <b>cycle</b> are kept in constant darkness (DD), the shedding peak is advanced- 2 h and the magnitude of shedding is reduced to 30 % of control. COS increased in mean length from 12 Am in controls to 14 Am after one cycle in DD and maintained this length during a second cycle in DD. In constant light (LL), disk shedding was damped to- 10 % of control values. Shedding synchrony in LL was also perturbed and therefore cyclic shedding bursts could not be distinguished. During LL there was a much larger increase in COS mean length than in DD. After one cycle of LL, COS length was 15 Am and after two cycles COS length exceeded 17 Am. When lizards entrained to 121 -: 1 2 D are shifted to a 6 L: 18 D regimen, the first shedding cycle is biphasic. The first peak of 5 % shedding occurs 2 h after light offset whereas a second larger peak (13 %) occurs according to the entrained schedule (1400 h). This manipulation separates out a dark triggered and circadian shedding component, which is normally superimposed in lizards entrained to a 12 L: 12 <b>D</b> <b>cycle.</b> When entrained lizards are placed in 36 h of LL followed by light offset, the peak shedding response after light offset is double the control response (53 % vs. 27 %). After 30 h of LL (lights off 90 ° out of phase), there is a biphasic shedding response similar to the ó-: 18 D regimen although this time the dark-triggered shedding component is greater in magnitude then the circadian component. COS turnover is estimated by extrapolating from COS mean length increases during LL. From this method we obtained a 2. 7 -Am increase in COS length during each day in LL. If COS growth is not augmented during LL, this would yield a 4 - 5 -d turnover time for the averag...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{high schools}} serve {{some of the}} most {{vulnerable}} students and their programs present a significant challenge to evaluate. Determining the impact of an alternative high school that serves mostly at-risk students presented a significant research problem. Few studies exist that dig deeper into the characteristics and strategies of successful alternative schooling. Moreover valid program evaluation methods to identify successful alternative school practices are hit and miss. As a result, public policy and systems of accountability have either disregarded information relating to alternative high schools or unjustifiably included them in comparisons with traditional high schools. This dissertation studied the issue of how best to evaluate alternative high schools and what tools support leaders in planning a thorough and accurate program evaluation. The Alternative High School Program Evaluation Toolkit was developed to support school leaders and evaluation teams made up of internal and external stakeholders as they facilitate the program evaluation process. The features of the Toolkit address the need for alternative school evaluation to be practical, useful, fair and accurate. The Evaluation Toolkit includes training materials, protocols, an evaluation planning worksheet and an evaluation planning matrix that supports the team in conducting the evaluation.

It carefully considers some perspectives on citizenship issues, particularly from Beck (1997) on risk society and Linklater (2002) on cosmopolitan citizenship. It applies the Research and Development (R & D) methodology of Borg and Gall (1983) by taking UNS students as a case study. The duration of the study will be two years, encompassing the following steps in the R & <b>D</b> <b>cycle</b> (1) research, analysis and needs assessment; (2) data collection; (3) model development; (4) validation of the model; (5) revision of the model; (6) preliminary testing of the model; (7) wider revision of the model; (8) main field testing; (9) final model revision. It is through this R & <b>D</b> <b>cycle</b> that a meaningful model of civic education that students, being the consumers of the product, value most can be better developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} new and {{innovative}} alternatives to traditional high schools has never been greater. Never designed to graduate all students on time, traditional high schools and their high dropout rates have remained unchanged for the last 30 years. Improving secondary schooling for all young people is a worthwhile social and educational objective. Many school leaders want to create alternative high schools but may lack the knowledge of what to do, nor may they have a comprehensive design process to follow. The research question explored in this dissertation is: What do leaders in education {{need to know to}} design innovative alternatives to traditional high schools? This dissertation studied four aspects or assumptions that school leaders should understand when designing alternatives to traditional high schools: (a) consider all of the elements of successful alternative high schools, (b) start over conceptually when designing a new alternative high school, (c) use regional accreditation standards as a framework for design, and (d) begin design with the end in mind for program evaluation. Research literature topics of alternative education, organizational leadership, school accreditation standards, and program evaluation were reviewed. The research conducted was theoretically and practically grounded in Bridges and Hallinger 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Borg and Gall 2 ̆ 7 s (1989) Research and Development (R 2 ̆ 6 <b>D)</b> <b>Cycle.</b> The product of the research conducted in the R 2 ̆ 6 <b>D</b> <b>cycle</b> was a process for designing alternative high schools. Qualitative and quantitative data collected from school leaders and designers during field tests was analyzed to improve a prototype of an alternative high school design process. An effective process that is ready for dissemination was the result of this research. A larger implication of the application of this process will be the improvement of high school experiences for all students through the creation of new designs for innovative forms of secondary schooling...|$|E
