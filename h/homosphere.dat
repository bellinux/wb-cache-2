5000|$|The <b>homosphere</b> and {{heterosphere}} {{are defined}} by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based <b>homosphere</b> includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere {{does not depend on}} molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about 100 km, the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km above the mesopause.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbopause}} {{marks the}} altitude in the Earth's atmosphere below which turbulent mixing dominates. The region below the turbopause {{is known as}} the <b>homosphere,</b> where the chemical constituents are well mixed and display identical height distributions; in other words, the chemical composition of the atmosphere remains constant in this region for chemical species which have long mean residence times. Highly reactive chemicals tend to exhibit great concentration variability throughout the atmosphere, whereas unreactive species will exhibit more homogeneous concentrations. The region above the turbopause is the heterosphere, where molecular diffusion dominates and the chemical composition of the atmosphere varies according to chemical species.|$|E

5000|$|There are forces {{throughout}} the <b>homosphere</b> (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere) that can impact the structural integrity of a cloud. However, {{as long as}} the air remains saturated, the natural force of cohesion that hold the molecules of a substance together acts to keep the cloud from breaking up. [...] Dissolution of the cloud can occur when the process of adiabatic cooling ceases and upward lift of the air is replaced by subsidence. This leads to at least some degree of adiabatic warming of the air which can result in the cloud droplets or crystals turning back into invisible water vapor. Stronger forces such as wind shear and downdrafts can impact a cloud, but these are largely confined to the troposphere where nearly all the Earth's weather takes place. A typical cumulus cloud weighs about 500 metric tons, or 1.1 million pounds, the weight of 100 elephants.|$|E
50|$|Cloud {{physics is}} the study of the {{physical}} processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of atmospheric clouds. These aerosols are found in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, which collectively make up the greatest part of the <b>homosphere.</b> Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice (cold clouds), or both (mixed phase clouds). Cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a critical value according to KÃ¶hler theory. Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary for cloud droplets formation because of the Kelvin effect, which describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface. At small radii, the amount of supersaturation needed for condensation to occur is so large, that it does not happen naturally. Raoult's Law describes how the vapor pressure is dependent on the amount of solute in a solution. At high concentrations, when the cloud droplets are small, the supersaturation required is smaller than without the presence of a nucleus.|$|E
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} below 100 km {{is often}} referred to as the homosphere; the region above, the heterosphere. In the <b>homosphere,</b> constitutents are mixed, and average molecular weight is constant. In the heterosphere, diffusive separation occurs, and species tend to fractionate; average molecular weight decreases with height. Mixing in the <b>homosphere</b> has its source dynamical (wind) energy. Against this background turbulence, intermittent enhancements of turbulent intensity are observed. Some of these enhancements are long lived [...] for example, a turbulent layer at approximately 86 km altitude seems to be almost a permanent feature of the (global) daytime D region, as oserved by partial reflection. This may well be a delineation of the mesopause level, since long-term radio meteor studies have shown approx. 85 km to be the breakpoint between thermospheric circulation above, and mesospheric circulation below. The use of stratosphere-troposphere (ST) radars in the lower atmosphere, and mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) and partial-reflection radars in the mesosphere for height/time profiles of turbulent intensity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} atmospheric regions, {{the distinction}} between <b>homosphere</b> and heterosphere, and changing atmospheric composition are discussed. The validity of the barometric law based on a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, for the major part of a planetary atmosphere and its breakdown in the exosphere due to escape of atmospheric particles is considered. The formation and maintenance of photochemical and diffusion-controlled ionospheric layers are treated. Their applicability to planetary ionospheres is dealt with. The spatial extent of magnetic and nonmagnetic planet ionospheres is investigated. Thermal and nonthermal processes responsible for the mass loss of planetary atmospheres are surveyed...|$|E

Using nominal orbital elements, and taking launch data and time as {{parameters of the}} problem, formula were established that give the data necessary for determining the flight plan. The geographical coordinates of the tangential points of the solar illumination boundaries were also calculated. It is shown that the latitude coverage of the observation {{is closely related to}} launch conditions. Expressions for the pointing angles referred to an instantaneous terrestrial trihedron are given. These angular elements are needed to determine the real pointing angles in a reference system linked to Spacelab...|$|E
40|$|International audiencehe Earth is {{surrounded}} by a layer of relatively thin gas, the mass of which is mainly concentrated in the first kilometres. With an exponential decrease of the density of the atmosphere as a function of altitude, 99. 9 % of this mass is located in the first 50 km. In addition, the composition of major species is homogeneous up to about 85 km, contrarily to what happens beyond. This is the <b>homosphere.</b> This layer of atmosphere, considered in this special issue, is also that which we breathe and which we unfortunately often pollute. All this justifies considering it as of vital importance, in the most basic sense of the word. However, in studying it, {{it is not possible to}} ignore what is happening beyond, from where comes, in particular, solar radiation, just as we cannot ignore what happens below the continents and the oceans, where solar radiation is absorbed, diffused and re-emitted to the top by the Earth's surface as infrared radiation. We must therefore keep in mind what are the layers that surround the <b>homosphere,</b> the importance of observing them and also give some examples of possible interactions which may exist with the surrounding layers; these are the objectives of these introductory remarks. Another general consideration must be made here, concerning the problems, which have existed until the middle of the 20 th century, of how to observe the atmosphere in situ at all the altitudes. However, since then, the development of engineering involving balloons, rockets, aircrafts and artificial satellites has revolutionized our knowledge of this observational atmosphere; this is the second message of these remarks...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{composition}} is kept almost homogeneous to {{a height of}} approximately 90 km (the <b>homosphere)</b> by mixing; above 100 km (the heterosphere), diffusive separation of the atmospheric constituents occurs. The heterosphere is dominated by two energy sources: solar extreme ultraviolet radiation and the solar wind. Many large variations are observed in this region and they can all be related, directly or indirectly, to variations in the intrinsic intensity of these two sources and to variations in {{the location of the}} sources relative to the observer. Atmospheric models can be successfully constructed in which the temperature and density variations are empirically related to solar and geomagnetic parameters. Some of the more recent findings concerning the structure and variations in the heterosphere are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbopause}} {{region is}} characterized by transition from the mean molecular mass (constant with altitude) to the mean mass (dependent on altitude). The former is provided by eddy turbulence, and the latter is induced by molecular diffusion. Competition between these processes provides {{the transition from the}} <b>homosphere</b> to the heterosphere. The turbopause altitude can be defined by equalizing the eddy and molecular diffusion coefficients and can be located in the upper mesosphere or the lower thermosphere. The height distributions of chemical inert gases very clearly demonstrate the transition from turbulent mixing to the diffusive separation of these gases. Using the height distributions of the chemical inert constituents He, Ar, and N 2 given by the MSIS-E- 90 model and the continuity equations, the height distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficient in the turbopause region can be inferred. The eddy diffusion coefficient always strongly reduces in the turbopause region. According to our results, eddy turbulence above its peak always cools the atmosphere. However, the cooling rates calculated with the eddy heat transport coefficient equaled to the eddy diffusion coefficient were found to be much larger than the cooling rates corresponding to the neutral temperatures given by the MSIS-E- 90 model. The same results were obtained for the eddy diffusion coefficients inferred from different experimental data. The main cause of this large cooling is the very steep negative gradient of the eddy heat transport coefficient, which is equal to the eddy diffusion coefficient if uniform turbulence takes place in the turbopause region. Analysis of wind shear shows that localized turbulence can develop in the turbopause region. In this case, eddy heat transport is not so effective and the strong discrepancy between cooling induced by eddy turbulence and cooling corresponding to the temperature given by the MSIS-E- 90 model can be removed...|$|E
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) model coupling a two-stream electron {{transport model}} of energy deposition with a 1 -D thermal conduction {{model has been}} developed. It is applied to investigate the links between auroral heat input and the vertical temperature of Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Two energy distributions meant to reproduce the emissions of a diffuse and a discrete aurora are {{used to evaluate the}} importance of the energy spectrum of the incident electrons for the thermal balance of Jupiter's auroral thermosphere. The values of observable quantities such as the altitude of the H- 2 emission peak, thermal infrared (LR), ultraviolet (UV) emissions, and temperatures associated with various optical signatures are used to constrain the parameters of these distributions. It is shown that the high-energy component of these energy distributions heats a region of the <b>homosphere</b> between 10 (- 4) and 10 (- 6) bar and mainly controls the H- 2 temperature and the far-UV (FUV) emission. A 3 -keV soft electron component is necessary to heat the region directly above the homopause, between 10 (- 6) and 10 (- 9) bar. It has a large influence on the H- 2 and H- 3 (+) temperatures and on the H- 3 (+) near-IR(NIR) emission. It is used in conjunction with a weak 100 eV component which is responsible for heating the thermosphere, from 10 (- 9) to 10 (- 12) bar and exerts a control on the exospheric temperature. The calculated temperatures, UV, and IR emissions suggest that the model probably misses a nonparticle heat source in the 10 (- 5) bar region, that is expected to balance the strong hydrocarbon cooling. Sensitivity tests are performed to evaluate the importance of the parameters of the energy distributions. They show that the FUV color ratio increases with the characteristic energy (or high-energy cutoff) of the high-energy component, while the H- 2 rovibrational temperature varies inversely. A trade-off is therefore necessary for these two parameters to simultaneously meet their observational constraints. Further tests demonstrate the essential thermostatic role played by H- 3 (+), which regulates the net heating in the thermosphere. An increased eddy diffusion reproduces the effect of a possible auroral upwelling of methane but gives rise to an H- 2 temperature smaller than the observed value. Peer reviewe...|$|E
