5|$|An Advisory Committee on Uranium {{was formed}} under Lyman J. Briggs, a {{scientist}} {{and the director}} of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army <b>intelligence</b> <b>report</b> on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.|$|E

This report, it turned out, was incorrect. Nonetheless, the Gang of Four were ordered to assassinate Amin, its leader Sarwari selecting his nephew Aziz Akbari to conduct the assassination. However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E

He was back at Bir el Hamisah by 09:00, having covered a distance of , when he heard news of Ottoman attacks.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new <b>intelligence</b> <b>report</b> published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle of Fallujah. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an <b>intelligence</b> <b>report</b> in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{just before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an <b>intelligence</b> <b>report</b> to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed, falsely, that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border. That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan's Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|There were {{increasing}} {{signs of}} heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded {{just such a}} North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near {{the conclusion of the}} Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came {{during the height of the}} season. One U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>report</b> estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.|$|E
