5|$|Christened by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson, {{the wife}} of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Lexington was {{launched}} on 3 October 1925. She was commissioned on 14 December 1927 with Captain Albert Marshall in command. By 1942, the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1,840 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christened by Mrs. Curtis D. Wilbur, {{wife of the}} Secretary of the Navy, Saratoga was {{launched}} on 7 April 1925 and commissioned on 16 November 1927, {{under the command of}} Captain Harry E. Yarnell. She was nicknamed by her crew Sister Sara and, later, Sara Maru. In 1942, the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1,840 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men,</b> and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> By 1945, her crew totaled 3,373, including her aviation group.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe rolling, and {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small turning radius, however, and were quick to answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men,</b> and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 officers and 344 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men,</b> and later to 35 officers and 401 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
50|$|Racial {{tensions}} {{continued on}} Christmas Day, when an African-American <b>enlisted</b> <b>man</b> {{walking back to}} camp from Agana was shot dead by two drunk white marines. Within hours, another black <b>enlisted</b> <b>man</b> {{was shot and killed}} by another drunken white <b>enlisted</b> <b>man</b> in Agana.|$|R
25|$|Vernon Lee Burge (November 29, 1888 – September 6, 1971) was an {{aviation}} pioneer. He {{was the first}} American <b>enlisted</b> <b>man</b> to be certified as a military pilot. After ten years as an <b>enlisted</b> <b>man,</b> Burge was commissioned during World War I and served the next 25 years as an officer.|$|R

5|$|The battalion's future {{had been}} {{referred}} to Sixth Army Group, the controlling formation, for further consideration; after some debate, they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> of the unit. The second inspection showed that the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> were broadly competent at their duties, but {{that most of them}} preferred rear-area duties over combat roles. The inspection recommended that the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> be transferred to one of the segregated infantry divisions. In the event, the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters, where it was used in a service role. It remained nominally active—to avoid the political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit—but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{regarded}} in the German Navy as excellent sea boats {{with an easy}} roll; the ships rolled up to 30° with a period of 10seconds. They maneuvered easily; at hard rudder the ships lost up to 60percent speed and heeled over 9°. However, they suffered from severe vibration, particularly at the stern, at high speeds. They also had very wet bows, even in moderate seas. The ships had a crew of 33 officers and 650 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> However, when serving as a squadron flagship, the crew was augmented by an additional 13 officers and 66 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> While acting as a second command ship, 9 officers and 44 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> {{were added to the}} standard crew. Wittelsbach and her sisters carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men,</b> and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{was laid}} down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong Whitworth's Low Walker {{shipyard}} in Newcastle upon Tyne. The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917. As completed, her complement numbered 737 officers and <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} between 651 and 674 officers and <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> She {{was considered to}} handle well by her captains and was a good sea-boat. In view of her intended duties abroad, her bottom was coppered to reduce biofouling.|$|E

5|$|Munitions transported {{through the}} {{magazine}} included bombs, shells, naval mines, torpedoes, and small arms ammunition. The munitions, {{destined for the}} Pacific Theater of Operations, were delivered to the Port Chicago facility by rail then individually loaded by hand, crane and winch onto cargo ships for transport to the war zones. From the beginning, all the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> employed as loaders at Port Chicago were African-American; all their commanding officers were white. All of the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> had been specifically trained {{for one of the}} naval ratings during his stay at Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) but the men were instead put to work as stevedores. None of the new recruits had been instructed in ammunition loading.|$|E
5|$|Of {{a pool of}} 5,000 applicants, the Ranger Training School {{selected}} 22 {{officers and}} 314 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> {{for the first three}} Ranger companies on 2 October, which were entirely white. A fourth, all African-American company was organized several days later. The 3rd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) was organized on 9 October 1950, assuming the lineage of A Company of the 3rd Ranger Battalion. It had an initial strength of 135 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> and five officers. The unit was formally activated on 25 October 1950 at Fort Benning. It was placed under command of Captain Jesse Tidwell and Bob Channon, who would be later promoted to Captain and in December, 1950, to executive officer.|$|E
5|$|The British {{official}} casualty return gave 15 killed, 46 {{wounded and}} 30 missing. As was often done in casualty returns with officers (but not with <b>enlisted</b> <b>men),</b> Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th {{were included in}} the “wounded” category although they were also taken prisoner. The Americans took 34 prisoners, including Lamont and King, which would indicate that two of the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. This gives a revised British loss (with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded) of 13 killed, 44 wounded and 34 captured.|$|E

[...] In another case, Robertson v. Wetherill, 21 USCMA 77, 44 CMR 131 (C.M.A. 1971), he ordered an <b>enlisted</b> <b>man</b> who {{was charged with}} possession of marijuana to face a general, rather than special, court martial.|$|R

5|$|Thompson {{requested}} from Davis {{two days}} {{to work out the}} details of the surrender with his officers. The Confederates under the command of Thompson agreed to surrender all the troops in the area on May 11. They picked Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, as the sites where Thompson's five thousand military troops would gather to receive their paroles. Ultimately Thompson surrendered about seventy-five hundred men all total that were under his command consisting of 1,964 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> with 193 officers paroled at Wittsburg in May 1865 and 4,854 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> with 443 officers paroled at Jacksonport on June 6, 1865.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who died of battle wounds, three {{officers}} and 12 <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> succumbed to disease, including its second colonel, Noah Farnham, who {{died as a result}} of his wounds sustained at Bull Run and a bout of typhoid. A total of 66 men of the 11th New York Infantry Regiment died in the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|At NSGL, {{the enlisted}} African Americans who {{tested in the}} top 30 to 40 percent were {{selected}} for non-labor battalion assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and <b>enlisted</b> <b>men.</b> The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their balanced rudder and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's <b>enlisted</b> <b>men</b> in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. <b>Enlisted</b> <b>men</b> on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
