This study aims {{to clarify the}} relative importance of soil organic matter and clay minerals on the cellulolytic activities of soils. Fluca prepared cellulase was immobilized on some agricultural residues and clay minerals, avicel and a sample of soil. Immobilized exoglucanase and endoglucanase were assayed at different times. Activities of the <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes</b> were strikingly dependent on the kind of sorbent. After 20 days of storing in refrigerator at 4 oC, the deactivation of <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the organic substances (as avicel) was very low but deactivation of <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the soil and clay minerals was relatively high. On the other hand, the activities of <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the agricultural residues and avicel were significantly higher than the soil and clay minerals. So it may be concluded that a large part of cellulolytic activity of soil is related to <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes</b> on agricultural residues. Coating of the clay minerals, soil and avicel with 4 mmol of Al (OH) x per mg of them significantly increased their immobilization capacity and activities of <b>immobilized</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Activities of <b>immobilized</b> exoglucanase and endoglucanase on the Ca- homoionized soil and clay minerals were significantly higher than the K- homoionized soil and clay minerals.
