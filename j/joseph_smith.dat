5|$|No Man Knows My History: The Life of <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> is a 1945 book by Fawn McKay Brodie, {{the first}} {{important}} non-hagiographic biography of <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith,</b> {{the founder of}} Latter Day Saint movement. The book has not gone out of print, and 60 years after its first publication, its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, continues to sell about a thousand copies annually. A revised edition appeared in 1971, and on the 50th anniversary of its first publication, Utah State University issued a volume of retrospective essays about the book, its author, and her methods.|$|E

5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|<b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American {{religious}} leader {{and founder of}} Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement. When he was twenty-four, Smith published the Book of Mormon. By {{the time of his}} death fourteen years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present.|$|E
5|$|The work ventures into transcendentalism, relying {{strongly}} on intuition, {{a movement}} and practice he had despised.

5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> III, eldest son of <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith.</b> Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a following as of 2014—however tiny it may be in some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith,</b> in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E
5|$|Reared in Utah in a respected, if impoverished, Mormon family, Brodie {{drifted away}} from {{religion}} during her graduate studies in literature at the University of Chicago. Having found temporary employment at the Harper Library, Brodie began researching {{the origins of}} Mormonism. Progress toward her eventual goal of writing a full biography of <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> was slowed by {{the birth of her}} first child and by three rapid moves to follow her husband's career, but in 1943, Brodie entered a three-hundred page draft of her book in a contest for the Alfred A. Knopf literary fellowship, and in May her application was judged the best of the forty-four entries.|$|E

5|$|The Church Administration Building (CAB) is an {{administrative}} {{office building in}} Salt Lake City, Utah, United States serving as the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. Completed in 1917, the building is adjacent to Temple Square, between the <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith</b> Memorial Building and the Lion House, on South Temple Drive. It differs from the Church Office Building {{in that it is}} much smaller and furnishes offices for the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by <b>Joseph</b> <b>Smith,</b> was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E

These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington & Jefferson College.|$|E
