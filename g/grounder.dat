5|$|The Cardinals scored {{again in}} the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners were safe at their {{respective}} bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak <b>grounder</b> that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a <b>grounder</b> to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' lead to 9–1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to seven runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{score was}} still tied at one apiece {{in the bottom}} of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second. Gehrig {{followed}} with a single, scoring Ruth and giving the Yankees the lead. Lazzeri lined a shot to left but Gehrig, on a headfirst dive, was tagged out at third by Bell. Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan's <b>grounder</b> for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning. The Yankees maintained their one-run advantage through the end of the eighth inning.|$|E
5|$|Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he {{was part}} of a rare {{defensive}} shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved to first base, with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely beat out a bunt single to first base, but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald's <b>grounder</b> to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set an AL record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and was used as a pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley <b>grounder</b> to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|Bickford was {{expected}} to start the 1948 season {{in the minor leagues}} due to lack of control. However, a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster. His Major League debut was on April 24, 1948 in a 16–9 loss against the New York Giants. He entered in relief {{at the top of the}} fourth inning, after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning. He got Sid Gordon to hit to a double play and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize, he retired Willard Marshall on a <b>grounder</b> to end the inning. He made his first career start against the Pirates, a 4–1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits. On June 7, he pitched a four-hitter in an 11–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, throwing five perfect innings before giving up a hit to Dick Culler to start the sixth inning. He finished with an 11–5 mark and a 3.27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In his only World Series appearance, he started Game 3, where he gave up one run on four hits in 3.1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit <b>grounder</b> is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

The last out was made by St. Louisian Ryan Howard, who chopped a <b>grounder</b> to Nick Punto at second. Punto saw Howard on the ground by home plate, having torn his achilles. He then lobbed the ball to Albert Pujols, who caught it to send the Cardinals to the NLCS {{for the first time}} since 2006.|$|E

25|$|Two Cardinal runs came in {{the second}} on an unusual two-run {{sacrifice}} fly by Tom Herr, with Willie McGee and Ozzie Smith scoring. With Willie McGee on first and attempting to steal, Brewers catcher Ted Simmons took a pitch-out but bobbled the ball allowing McGee to steal second. After a walk to Ozzie Smith, Moose Haas’ wild pitch moved McGee to third and Smith to second. On Herr's deep sacrifice fly, Smith took advantage of center fielder Gorman Thomas slipping and falling on the warning track. Ken Oberkfell followed with a walk, stole second and came home when a Keith Hernandez <b>grounder</b> went through Gantner's legs. The Cardinals scored three times despite only one base hit.|$|E
25|$|A first-inning {{run on a}} Gene Tenace passed ball gave Detroit {{an early}} lead in the {{deciding}} fifth and final game in Detroit, but Reggie Jackson's steal of home in the 2nd tied it up.

Hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a <b>grounder</b> to second, but umpire John Rice ruled that Norm Cash pulled his foot off first base. Replays and photos, however, show that Cash did not pull his foot.

25|$|Dan Haren's struggles {{continued}} as the calendar moved into August. He allowed seven runs in 4 1/3 innings as the Dodgers were blown {{out by the}} Chicago Cubs, 8–2, to snap the winning streak. Hanley Ramírez hit a walk-off homer the next day as the Dodgers won 5–2 in extra innings. Matt Kemp hit his fifth home run in six games on August 3, but poor pitching from Josh Beckett and several relief pitchers led to a 7–3 loss to the Cubs. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim jumped out to a quick lead {{in the first inning}} and Garrett Richards pitched a complete game shutout in their 5–0 win over the Dodgers in the opener of the next series. Juan Uribe hit a three-run homer the next night and the Dodgers won on a walk-off <b>grounder</b> by Andre Ethier for a 5–4 win.|$|E
25|$|Back on {{the road}} in Philadelphia on September 2, the Braves, {{starting}} the top of the ninth inning with the game tied 4-4, batted around with hits from Inciarte, Garcia, Freeman, Kemp, Markakis and Freeman a second time to score five runs, and win 9-4 in the first of a three-game series against the Phillies. The next night, two homers from Garcia, a fielders choice <b>grounder</b> from Flowers to drive in the go-ahead run and a ground out from Peterson to bring in another run gave the Braves a 6-4 victory in the second game of the series. In the final game of the three-game series, Teheran gave up only five hits and struck out seven batters in six innings pitched, Kemp hit his 28th homer of the season in the second and Freeman hit his 29th in the eighth, and Johnson earned his 15th save of the season to beat the Phillies 2-0.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} series, Grand Rapids swept Kalamazoo {{in the best}} of three game set, by the scores of 5–2 and 4–1. In Game 1, Studnicka started for Grand Rapids and allowed only two runs in eight innings of work. With the score tied 2–2 going into the fourth inning, the Chicks scored three runs off Lassies’ pitcher Gloria Cordes. With the bases loaded, Ziegler drove home one run with a {{sacrifice}} fly to put the score in favor of Grand Rapids, 3–2. Another sacrifice fly by Inez Voyce and a RBI single by Joyce Ricketts extended the lead to 5–2. When the Lassies first two batters reached base in the final inning, manager English brought Eleanor Moore to the rescue. She promptly retired the next three batters in order, striking out Isabel Alvarez, retiring Dorothy Schroeder with a pop fly to shortstop Ziegler, and inducing June Peppas on a sharp <b>grounder</b> to the mound throwing to Voyce at first base for the final out of the game.|$|E

Reggie Jackson's steal of home {{in the second inning}} tied it up, though Jackson was injured in a collision with Freehan and had to leave the game. Tenace's two-out single to left field plated George Hendrick to give Oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning.

25|$|The Dodgers next {{went back}} on the road to face the first place Milwaukee Brewers. Ted Lilly was again sharp, {{allowing}} just two hits in seven innings of work, but one of the hits was a solo home run by Ryan Braun. The Brewers added two more solo shots off Dodger relievers in the eighth and won 3-0 as the Dodgers hit into 4 double plays and a triple play and were unable to score against Randy Wolf. The Dodgers had another strong pitching performance from their starter the next day, as Chad Billingsley allowed only one run in seven innings of work, but the Dodgers were unable to solve Yovani Gallardo and the game was tied at 1-1 entering the bottom of the ninth. However, relief pitchers Hong-Chih Kuo and Mike MacDougal were unable to record an out in the inning and the Brewers recorded the 2-1 walk-off win on Mark Kotsay's bases loaded pinch-hit single. The Brewers won another pitching duel from the Dodgers the following day 3-1 despite another strong start by rookie Nathan Eovaldi. Tony Gwynn, Jr. hit his first home run since July 17, 2010 for the Dodgers lone run of the game. Clayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers avoid a sweep by pitching eight shutout innings to pick up his 15th win as the Dodgers won 5-1 on August 18. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher to pick up his 15th win before September since Hideo Nomo in 2003. Hiroki Kuroda finally got some run support, picking up the win in the Dodgers 8-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on August 19. Rod Barajas hit a three-run homer in the third inning as Kuroda allowed two runs in six innings for his seventh consecutive quality start since the all-star break. The Dodgers blew an extra inning lead and lost to the Rockies 7-6 in 13 innings the next day. They had taken the lead {{in the top of the}} 12th on a solo homer by Aaron Miles and an inside the park homer by Trent Oeltjen, but rookie closer Javy Guerra blew his first save of the season. A walk-off single by Dexter Fowler in the 13th ended the game. Oeltjen's inside the park homer was the 1st by a Dodger since Blake DeWitt on May 6, 2008. James Loney had 4 hits in 4 at-bats on the 21st, including his 6th homer of the season. Chad Billingsley struck out 7 and only allowed 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but was victimized by two 2-run homers by Carlos González and Seth Smith and the Dodgers dropped the finale against the Rockies 5-3. With the win, the Rockies broke a 17-game losing streak in Sunday games, a Major League record. The Dodgers next started a three-game series on the road against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chris Carpenter blanked the Dodgers through eight innings, but the Dodgers rallied in the ninth as Aaron Miles hit an RBI triple off Fernando Salas to tie the score at one and then Rod Barajas hit a <b>grounder</b> to short that former Dodger Rafael Furcal bobbled to allow Miles to score with the winning run. Kershaw picked up his 16th win the next night, pitching six scoreless innings in the Dodgers 13-2 win over the Cardinals. Matt Kemp and Aaron Miles hit solo homers and Rod Barajas hit two homers as the Dodger offense had a rare outburst of power. The Dodgers won the final game of the series 9-4 thanks to a six run third inning and another effective performance by Hiroki Kuroda. The offensive outburst included the first career home run by A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers picked up their first series sweep of the Cardinals on the road since 1993. The Dodgers also moved ahead in the lifetime series with the Cardinals 1,002 wins to 1,001 for the Cards.|$|E
