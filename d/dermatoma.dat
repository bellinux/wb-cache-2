40|$|We {{present a}} patient with left {{compressive}} L 5 -S 1 lumbar disc hernia in lateral reces and foramina revealed by high intensity pain (Visual Autologus Scale 7 / 10) and paresthesias on the left S 1 <b>dermatoma</b> for 5 months. He refused surgery and followed conservative treatment with very good results after 6 months. The radicular S 1 pain became of a small intensity (Visual Autologus Scale 2 - 3 / 10) and intermitent and after one year it completely disapeared. After 4 years he repeated the lumbar magnetic resonance imaging which proved the disapearance of the L 5 -S 1 lumbar disc hernia...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the clinical use of a medetomidine/propofol TIVA technique in horses. Twenty-seven equidae of mixed breed, age [mean ± SD (range) ] 2. 9 ± 2. 74 (0. 11 – 11) years, weight (n = 15) 237 ± 130. 22 (64 – 470) kg were anaesthetized for the following procedures: intra-abdominal (3); castration (15); joint flush (4); screw removal (1); desmotomy (3) and <b>dermatoma</b> removal (1). Horses were sedated with 7 µg kg− 1 medetomidine IV and 10 minutes later anaesthesia was induced with 2 mg kg− 1 propofol IV. Incremental doses of medetomidine were given prior to induction if the horse lifted its head when approached. Following induction, trachea were intubated and oxygen administered at FIO 2 > 90...|$|E
40|$|Toxocara canis {{causes the}} visceral larva migrans {{syndrome}} in which central nervous involvement is rare. We report {{the case of}} a 40 -year-old woman presenting with a subacute weakness of the right leg and dysaesthesiae in the right Th 8 -Th 10 <b>dermatomas.</b> Spinal magnetic resonance imaging examination showed abnormal hyperintensity within the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed eosinophilic pleocytosis. Antibody titres to Toxocara canis were higher in the cerebrospinal fluid than in the serum. Treatment using mebendazole led to a complete clinical recovery, normalization of cerebrospinal fluid parameters and improvement in spinal magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: Estudio prospectivo y comparativo que compara la eficacia de la administración intradiscal de ozono asociada a radiofrecuencia pulsada de la raíz lumbar comprometida con cada una de estas 2 técnicas, de forma aislada, en el tratamiento del dolor radicular secundario a hernia discal. Material y método: Se incluyó en el estudio a 30 pacientes con clínica de dolor lumbar severo, escala visual analógica (EVA) > 6, de más de 3 meses de duración, resistente al tratamiento conservador (medicación oral y fármacos epidurales), con signos de afectación radicular con o sin parestesia e hipoestesia y con distribución correspondiente al <b>dermatoma</b> afectado. Los criterios radiológicos de inclusión fueron: evidencia en la resonancia magnética (RM) de hernia discal contenida con o sin degeneración discal. Los pacientes se distribuyeron aleatoriamente en 3 grupos: grupo A (5 - 15 ml de ozono intradiscal a 27 mg/ml de concentración y radiofrecuencia pulsada del ganglio de la raíz dorsal correspondiente); grupo B (5 - 15 ml de ozono intradiscal a 27 mg/ml de concentración) y grupo C (radiofrecuencia pulsada del ganglio de la raíz dorsal al nivel comprometido). La eficacia analgésica se valoró a los 15 días, al mes, y a los 3 y 6 meses de la técnica, mediante EVA y se llevó a cabo una valoración radiológica con RM a los 3 meses. El estudio estadístico se realizó mediante el programa SPSS 14. 0 para Windows. Se consideró significativa una p Objective: We {{performed}} a prospective, comparative study that evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} intradiscal ozone administration associated with pulsed radiofrequency of the compromised lumbar root versus the isolated use {{of each of these}} two techniques in the management of radicular pain secondary to a herniated disc. Materials and method: The study included 30 patients with severe back pain, visual analog scale (VAS) > 6 and onset more than 3 months previously, who were resistant to conservative treatment (oral medication and epidural drugs) and showed signs of radicular involvement with or without paresthesia and hypoesthesia in the region of the affected dermatomes. The radiological inclusion criteria were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of a contained herniated disc with or without disc degeneration. The patients were randomly distributed into three groups: group A (5 - 15 ml intradiscal ozone concentration at 27 mg/ml and pulsed radiofrequency of the compromised dorsal root ganglia); group B (5 - 15 ml of intradiscal ozone concentration at 27 mg/ml) and group C (pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglia {{at the level of the}} hernia). Analgesic efficacy was assessed at 15 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months of the technique, using the VAS. Radiological assessment with MRI was {{performed a}}fter 3 months. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 14. 0 for Windows. Values of P < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: the levels affected, in order of frequency, were L 4 -L 5 (16 / 53. 3 %), L 5 -S 1 (10 / 33. 3 %) and L 3 -L 4 (4 / 13. 33 %). The mean amount of ozone administered was 8 ± 2. 5 ml in group A and 6. 5 ± 2. 4 ml in group B. In group A, 90 % of the patients showed significant improvement (p < 0. 05) in all follow-up evaluations. In 80 % of the patients in group B, improvement occurred later, but was maintained at 6 months after the technique. In group C, 90 % of the patients showed improvement at an early stage, but its duration was significantly shorter than in the other two groups. MRI showed a significant reduction in hernia volume in groups A and B (65 % and 70 % respectively). No complications associated with the techniques were observed. Conclusions: Pulsed radiofrequency of the affected root improved the effectiveness of intradiscal ozone administration, with early onset of pain reduction, which was subsequently maintained by the late ozone-induced reduction in hernia size...|$|E
