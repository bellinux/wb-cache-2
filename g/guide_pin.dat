30|$|The torn ACL {{was removed}} to clearly {{visualize}} the ACL footprint. Two 2.4 -mm <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were inserted from the lateral femoral cortex to the femoral ACL footprint behind the resident’s ridge and just anterior to the cartilage margin (Iwahashi et al., 2010) with an anterolateral entry femoral aimer (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy). Two 5.0 - to 6.0 -mm femoral tunnels matched with the graft diameters were {{created for the}} AMM/AML and PL grafts by over-drilling via the <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> For the tibia, three 2.4 -mm <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were parallelly inserted from the medial tibial cortex to the anteromedial portion of the tibial ACL footprint (Otsubo et al., 2012) with a tibial tip aimer (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy). The <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were over-drilled to create two anteriorly-located tunnels (4.5 - to 5.0 -mm) for the two portions of the AMM/AML graft and one posteriorly-located tunnel (5.0 - to 6.0 -mm) for the PL graft, matching the graft diameters. Two Endobutton-CLs (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy) with appropriate loop lengths were connected to each loop end of the two grafts. The unified tibial end of the PL graft was sutured with two No. 2 polyethylene sutures using a Krackow stitch. Each tibial end of the bifurcated AMM/AML graft was also sutured with a No. 2 polyethylene suture by a Krackow stitch, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Ho-Ru {{was a light}} tank {{destroyer}} {{similar to}} the German Hetzer, but armed with the weaker 47 mm main gun (Type 1 47 mm tank gun). The Type 5 Ho-Ru utilized the chassis of the Type 95 Ha-Go, but its suspension was enlarged to 350 mm track link width. There were two set rows of wheel <b>guide</b> <b>pins,</b> holding a road wheel between them. The sprocket of the driving wheel was the grating type to gear with the wheel <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> like on the Soviet T-34. The development of the Type 5 Ho-Ru started in February 1945 with only a single prototype being completed {{before the end of}} the war.|$|R
40|$|The mobile remote {{manipulator}} system (MRMS) was initially developed for transit about the trusses {{of the delta}} space station; however, it can be utilized just as easily for transit about the trusses of the dual keel station. The MRMS is comprised of a mobile platform having a rail system formed of transversely disposed T-shaped tracks, which engage with <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> located at the nodes of the trusses. The <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> form a grid and the tracks are so designed as to permit travel in either of two orthogonal directions. The present invention provides a near-uniform traversing velocity with minimal dynamic loading on the system. Pivoting changers move the platform from one face to another...|$|R

50|$|A click pen {{has several}} parts to it: the frame, a thruster, two cams, a <b>guide</b> <b>pin,</b> a spring, an ink {{cartridge}} with ink, a ballpoint {{at the end}} of the cartridge, and other parts that may vary. The spring provides the tension required to retract the ink cartridge. The cams provide a bistable system where in one position the ink cartridge is retracted and in the other it is extended. When the button end of the pen is pressed, the system moves from one position to the other. The <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is typically molded into the frame of the pen.|$|E
40|$|A mobile remote {{manipulator}} system is disclosed for assembly, repair and logistics transport on, around {{and about a}} space station square bay truss structure. The vehicle {{is supported by a}} square track arrangement supported by <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> integral with the space station truss structure and located at each truss node. Propulsion is provided by a central push-pull drive mechanism that extends out from the vehicle one full structural bay over the truss and locks drive rods into the <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> The draw bar is now retracted and the mobile {{remote manipulator}} system is pulled onto the next adjacent structural bay. Thus, translation of the vehicle is inchworm style. The drive bar can be locked onto two <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> while the extendable draw bar is within the vehicle and then push the vehicle away one bay providing bidirectional push-pull drive. The track switches allow the vehicle to travel in two orthogonal directions over the truss structure which coupled with the bidirectional drive, allow movement in four directions on one plane. The top layer of this trilayered vehicle is a logistics platform. This platform is capable of 369 degees of rotation and will have two astronaut foot restraint platforms and a space crane integral...|$|R
50|$|The breech {{was locked}} and {{unlocked}} by recoil action which brings the operating level <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> against cams to raise and lower the breechblock. The function of the breechblock was {{to assist in the}} final chambering of the round, close the breech, and actuate the trigger trip. It also provided a mounting for the firing pin.|$|R
50|$|The first {{mechanized}} molding lines {{consisted of}} sand slingers and/or jolt-squeeze devices that compacted the {{sand in the}} flasks. Subsequent mold handling was mechanical using cranes, hoists and straps. After core setting the copes and drags were coupled using <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> and clamped for closer accuracy. The molds were manually pushed off on a roller conveyor for casting and cooling.|$|R
50|$|The {{forerunner of}} the railway in Germany, as in England, {{was to be}} found mainly in {{association}} with the mining industry. Mine carts were used below ground for transportation, initially using wooden rails, and were steered either by a <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> between the rails or by flanges on the wheels.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "pin router" [...] {{accessory}} is used. A pin router {{originally had}} a pin {{in the table}} that would trace the part and hung the router motor on an [...] "over arm" [...] that rose from one edge or corner of the router table, arced over the table, and descends directly (coaxially) towards the pin. This was a big safety concern as people's hand were very accessible to the cutter. In 1976 C.R. Onsrud patented the Inverted Pin Router that reversed the two and mounted the motor {{under the table and}} the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> on the [...] "over arm". A template (with an interior recess on the top face removed) is affixed to the workpiece, and the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is lowered into this recess. The template is then moved against the pin, carrying the workpiece against the spinning router bit and creating a duplicate of the patterned part.|$|E
5000|$|HO slot cars work on {{a similar}} principle, but the current is carried by thin metal rails that project barely above the track surface and are set farther out from the slot. The car's {{electrical}} contacts, called [...] "pickup shoes", are generally fixed directly to the chassis, and a round <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is often used instead of a swiveling flag.|$|E

50|$|Polarization {{refers to}} design {{features}} on mating connectors—such as keyways or shell geometries—to insure connectors can be mated {{in only one}} possibleorientation. Often a key or dog use a short pin that slides into a corresponding slot or keyway is used to guide the plug and receptacletogether during mating to insure polarization of the mating contacts. <b>Guide</b> <b>pins</b> {{can also be used}} to insure correct polarization.|$|R
50|$|The {{second phase}} starts when the display {{register}} goes from 9 to 0. The kicking pawl passes its <b>guiding</b> <b>pin</b> and its spring (z,u) positions it above this pin ready {{to push back}} on it. The sautoir keeps on moving up and suddenly the second carry pin drops it. The sautoir falls of its own weight. During the second phase, the sautoir and the two wheels are completely disconnected.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the tape}} {{detached}} during flight, the hammer was prevented from being forced inward by air resistance {{by a thin}} [...] "shearing wire" [...] passing through the hammer spindle, which was easily broken by the hammer encountering any physical resistance. The spindle was prevented from rotating relative to the fuze body in flight, and hence from snapping the shearing wire, by a <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> passing through a cutout in the spindle.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1568, German miners {{working in}} the Mines Royal near Keswick had {{knowledge}} of tub railways: archaeological work at the Mines Royal site at Caldbeck in the English Lake District has now confirmed the use of [...] "hunds", as track fragments have been found. The wooden tubs, known as [...] "hunds" [...] ("dog" [...] in German) ran on two wide boards or rails and were used to move ore within the mines. These hunds used a <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> system, utilising the slot between the two board rails to keep them on course.|$|E

30|$|Once the graft is {{harvested}} {{and placed}} under the first layer, it is temporarily tied over the <b>guiding</b> <b>pin</b> and its isometry is evaluated by several full flexions and extensions of the knee, avoiding an over-constrained reconstruction. It is important to verify {{at the end of}} the procedure that there is some lateral patellar translation with the knee extended, with a firm lateral endpoint. Furthermore, the correct patellar tracking is also assessed dynamically under arthroscopic view.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} {{name of this}} four-hole system is triohålning since it was adapted to the [...] "Trio binder" [...] which was awarded Swedish patent in 1890. The binder's inventor Andreas Tengwall supposedly named it after a consortium consisting of himself and two companions, i.e. a trio.The binder can be opened at any place while holding the papers in place as the inner holes as forked <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> from one side, the outer holes has pins from the other side.|$|R
5000|$|Internal designs vary by {{the model}} and manufacturer, but {{generally}} a dekatron has ten cathodes {{and one or two}} guide electrodes plus a common anode. The cathodes are arranged in a circle with a guide electrode (or two) between each cathode. When the guide electrode(s) is pulsed properly, the neon gas will activate near the <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> then [...] "jump" [...] to the next cathode. Pulsing the guide electrodes (negative going pulses) repeatedly will cause the neon dot to move from cathode to cathode.|$|R

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} 20 years, ankle {{arthrodesis}} {{with use of}} screw augmentation has become a popular technique to gain fusion of the arthritic ankle. The objective of this cadaver {{study was to identify}} the risks to local neurovascular structures using standard operative practices for percutaneous <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> placement. Methods: Nine fresh frozen cadaver limbs were used. A <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> from the Synthes (Paoli, PA) 7. 3 -mm cannulated set was placed percutaneously into the distal posterolateral leg with the ankle held in neutral position. A layered dissection was then performed from the skin to tibia. Neurovascular injury and distance of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> from the sural and tibial nerves were noted. Results: The <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> did not touch the sural or tibial nerves in any specimens. With this technique, the mean distance of the pin from the sural nerve and tibial nerve at th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study firstly {{conducted}} measurement of load history profiles at brake guide pins using strain gages subject to random road load history obtained from vehicle durability tests. Then, this study developed a {{simple mathematical model}} capable of estimating <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> load history using the principle of energy conservation for a given road load profile. The model took into account the effect of impact that occurs {{from a range of}} acceleration levels and frequency content of the road input. The mathematical model also utilized the measured stiffness of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> specimens and strain versus load relationship to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The estimated loads at a brake <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> subject to a given random road load history were then computed using the mathematical model and compared to the load history obtained from the measurement. This study also compared cumulative fatigue damages calculated using Smith-Watson-Topper equation with the measured and predicted load profiles at the <b>guide</b> <b>pin.</b> The comparison study showed that the developed simple model is applicable to predict load profiles for fatigue life calculation at brake guide pins...|$|E

25|$|Good {{single crystal}} {{diffraction}} experiments in diamond anvil cells require sample stage to rotate on the vertical axis, omega. Most diamond anvil cells do not feature a large opening {{that would allow}} the cell to be rotated to high angles, a 60 degrees opening is considered sufficient for most crystals but larger angles are possible. The first cell to be used for single crystal experiments was designed by {{a graduate student at the}} University of Rochester, Leo Merrill. The cell was triangular with beryllium seats that the diamonds were mounted on; the cell was pressurized with screws and <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> holding everything in place.|$|R

Mobile-platform concept proposed to move remote manipulators, workers, or other loads over truss panels on large structures. Platform moves at constant speed so {{does not cause}} swinging motion in hanging loads and overstress remote-manipulator arms. Transferred around corners to adjacent panels. Platform rides on sprocketed <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> extending from structure at truss joints. Set of orthogonal tracks under platform slides on pins, which have enlarged heads to interlock with tracks.

30|$|In {{cases where}} a {{cortical}} button is employed {{to secure the}} graft to the femur, our group has observed an unsteady movement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> that is not securely fixed in bone when over drilled with a cannulated femoral drill. This common scenario is presumed to occur when the drilling sequence produces the smaller cortical button drill hole before the larger graft tunnel socket. In this situation, the tunnel <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> would be loose within the cortical button drill hole. As a consequence of drilling over a loose <b>guide</b> <b>pin,</b> the drill might “wobble” and possibly alter the tunnel shape and aperture dimensions. To our knowledge, this observation was not {{reported in the literature}} with no previous study comparing the effect of changing the drilling sequence of the femoral tunnel on the tunnel shape.|$|E
30|$|The screw {{trajectory}} {{is planned}} on both AP and lateral image intensifier projections, drawing {{a line on}} the thigh for each view. A <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> with the image intensifier is used to establish these lines. The intersection of these lines on the anterolateral thigh marks the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> insertion site through the skin. The trajectory is planned to attempt a central pin position within the femoral epiphysis on both AP and lateral views, crossing the physis at a 90 ° angle [4].|$|E
30|$|In obese patients, lateral {{fluoroscopic}} {{visualization of}} the hip is sometimes poor with the patient positioned on the fracture table. On a radiolucent table, manipulation of the limb to obtain frog lateral images {{of the hip}} is not only more expeditious, but often provides a higher quality image on the lateral view than that obtained on a fracture table. However, manipulation of a large leg risks bending even the most stout guide pins. Special care is required to avoid bending the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> in all cases, especially as the girth of the leg increases. Protected rotation of the leg while holding the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> {{at the site of}} skin insertion will allow adequate external rotation to see the lateral trajectory. Forceful manipulation into the flexion–abduction frog position should be avoided while the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is in place. If required, slight rotation of the image intensifier may aid in obtaining the full lateral view.|$|E
40|$|Fracture-dislocation {{of the hip}} is a rare {{event that}} usually results from high-energy injury. These {{patients}} require a systemic trauma survey to uncover concomitant injuries. Early closed reduction within 6 h is recommended to decrease the incidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Iatrogenic complete femoral neck fracture during closed reduction for posterior dislocation of the femoral head is a rare complication. A modified technique, the Kocher-Langenbeck approach, for open reduction of the femoral neck fracture using antegrade <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> and retrograde cannulated screws fixation can resolute this situation in one stage. This method provides an anatomic reduction and stable fixation {{for this kind of}} injury...|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} cases of {{military}} technology interchange. The Ho-Ru SPG with 47 mm AT cannon, resembled the German Hetzer tank destroyer combined with wheel <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> like the T-34. The heavy tank destroyers Ho-Ri I and II, {{armed with a}} 105 mm cannon, {{seem to have been}} influenced by German Jagd heavy tanks Elefant and Jagdtiger. The Type 4 Chi-To medium tank, armed with a 75 mm cannon, and the Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank, armed with 75 or 88 mm cannon, were influenced by the Panther, Tiger I, and Tiger II German tanks. The Type 1 Ho-Ha half-track armoured personnel carrier was similar to the German Sd.Kfz. 251 armoured fighting vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|MT-RJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack) uses a {{form factor}} and latch {{similar to the}} 8P8C (RJ45) connectors. Two {{separate}} fibers are included in one unified connector. It is easier to terminate and install than ST or SC connectors. The smaller size allows twice the port density on a face plate than ST or SC connectors do. The MT-RJ connector was designed by AMP, but was later standardized as FOCIS 12 (Fiber Optic Connector Intermateability Standards) in EIA/TIA-604-12. There are two variations: pinned and no-pin. The pinned variety, which has two small stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> {{on the face of}} the connector, is used in patch panels to mate with the no-pin connectors on MT-RJ patch cords.|$|R
