Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior. Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> the [...] "empty" [...] drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully {{to the point that}} they smoked in the room with [...] "empty" [...] drums, but not in the room with full ones. Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the [...] "empty drums".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{diesel fuel}} will burn in open air using a wick, {{it does not}} release {{a large amount of}} <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> which could lead to an explosion. The low vapor {{pressure}} of diesel is especially advantageous in marine applications, where the accumulation of explosive fuel-air mixtures is a particular hazard. For the same reason, diesel engines are immune to vapor lock.|$|E
50|$|A {{household}} {{light switch}} may emit a small, harmless visible spark when switching. In an ordinary atmosphere this arc {{is of no}} concern, but if a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> is present, the arc might start an explosion. Electrical equipment intended {{for use in a}} chemical factory or refinery is designed either to contain any explosion within the device, or is designed not to produce sparks with sufficient energy to trigger an explosion.|$|E

50|$|On October 6, 2005, around 15:05CDT (20:05 UTC), {{a trailer}} being pulled by a {{forklift}} {{caught on a}} valve in the propylene piping system near the Olefins II Unit, pulling the valve {{and part of the}} piping loose, leaving a 1.9 inch (3.5 cm) hole. Pressurized liquid propylene poured out of the opening, partially vaporizing, leaving a pool of liquid propylene and creating a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud. The forklift driver and other nearby contractors saw the cloud and immediately evacuated the area.|$|E
50|$|Wood Gasifier: To {{keep the}} {{generator}} engine running {{they will need}} a constant fuel supply. One way is to scavenge for gasoline, but that method is dangerous and barely sustainable. John C. proposed building a gasifier after noticing an abundance of wood. A gasifier is two containers each holding wood scraps. The wood in the first container is used to build a fire. The fire heats the wood in the second container releasing a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> called wood gas. The wood gas is then piped directly into the generator engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{vessel was}} a {{steamship}} built in 1958. At its final port of call, Sansinena had discharged its cargo {{of crude oil}} and was taking on ballast and fuel when a massive explosion split the ship in half and obliterated multiple port buildings. The blast shattered windows for miles around and triggered a fire that spread across the dock and around the tanker. The Los Angeles Fire Department soon {{arrived on the scene}} to contain the blaze and rescue survivors. A United States Coast Guard investigation later concluded that the incident was caused by <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> buildup {{on the deck of the}} ship. The ignition source was never identified.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft zones {{differ in}} usage, pressurization, {{temperature}} range, exposure to severe weather and lightning strikes, and the hazards contained such as ignition sources, <b>flammable</b> fluids, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors,</b> or rotating machines.

50|$|In the mid-1960s, the US Navy {{developed}} aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This synthetic foam has a {{low viscosity}} and spreads rapidly {{across the surface of}} most hydrocarbon fuels. A water film forms beneath the foam, which cools the liquid fuel, stopping the formation of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors.</b> This provides dramatic fire knockdown, an important factor in crash rescue fire fighting.|$|R
50|$|All liquids have a {{specific}} vapor pressure, which {{is a function of}} that liquid's temperature and is subject to Boyle's Law. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of vapor of a flammable or combustible liquid in the air increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of vapor of the flammable liquid in the air. A certain concentration of a flammable or combustible vapor is necessary to sustain combustion in air, the lower flammable limit, and that concentration is different and is specific to each flammable or combustible liquid. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> to induce ignition when an ignition source is applied.|$|E

5000|$|The NTSB {{considers}} the party system {{crucial to the}} investigative process, as it provides the NTSB with access to individuals with specialized expertise relevant to a particular investigation. [...] However, use of the party system is not without controversy. The NTSB invited The Boeing Company to participate as {{a party to the}} investigation of the crash of TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747, in 1996. While the NTSB relied on Boeing's sharing of expertise, it was later determined that Boeing had withheld from the NTSB a study of military versions of the 747 that investigated <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> combustion in the center fuel tank. [...] Boeing had told the NTSB that it had no studies proving or disproving the vapor combustion theory. [...] In response to political pressure after the Boeing incident, the NTSB commissioned the nonprofit Rand Corporation to conduct an independent study of the NTSB's aircraft investigation process.|$|E
50|$|Unlike steel, bronze struck {{against a}} hard surface will not {{generate}} sparks, so it (along with beryllium copper) {{is used to}} make hammers, mallets, wrenches and other durable tools {{to be used in}} explosive atmospheres or in the presence of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors.</b> Bronze is used to make bronze wool for woodworking applications where steel wool would discolour oak.|$|R
50|$|Small flash fires {{can occur}} in the {{operating}} room during surgery where the presence of ignition sources such as electrical instruments or lasers, an oxygen-rich environment, and <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> (e.g. alcohol-based disinfectants) may set the stage for such an accident. While apparently smaller fires go unreported, surgical flash fires have led to burn injuries and fatalities.|$|R
50|$|Hot {{surfaces}} on {{the heater}} pose {{a fire and}} burn risk. The open flame poses an explosion risk in environments where <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> may be present, such as in a garage. Use of improper or contaminated fuel could cause poor performance, a fire or an explosion. There are the usual risks involved with the storage of kerosene and when refilling the heater.|$|R
5000|$|The Cleveland open-cup {{method is}} one of three main methods in {{chemistry}} for determining the flash point of a petroleum product using a Cleveland open-cup apparatus, also known as a Cleveland open-cup tester. [...] First, the test cup of the apparatus (usually brass) is filled to a certain level with a portion of the product. Then, the temperature of this chemical is increased rapidly and then at a slow, constant rate as it approaches the theoretical flash point. The increase in temperature will cause the chemical to begin to produce <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> in increasing quantities and density. The lowest temperature at which a small test flame passing over the surface of the liquid causes the vapor to ignite is considered the chemical's flash point. This apparatus may also be used to determine the chemical's fire point which is considered to have been reached when the application of the test flame produces at least five continuous seconds of ignition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} the {{environmental}} dispersion (i. e. atmospheric stability, wind speed, temperature, humidity and ground roughness) and source release factors (i. e. pipeline diameter, length, pressure and release opening area) on the suffocation distance, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance, overpressure distance and thermal radiation distance after the natural gas released from pipeline were evaluated and analyzed. The results show that all the environmental dispersion factors except humidity {{have an effect on}} the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The more stable atmospheric condition, lower wind speed and smaller ground roughness lead to the longer <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The atmosphere temperature has a very limited influence on the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The higher ambient temperature and larger humidity result in the longer downwind thermal radiation distance, while the atmospheric stability, wind speed and ground roughness nearly does not. All the four source release factors significantly influence the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance and thermal radiation distance, which is due to the different release amount, release rate and initial momentum...|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of mining}} {{equipment}} fires from 1990 through 1999 reveals {{that there were}} 340 large mining equipment fires, resulting in 72 injuries and five fatalities. Many of the fires resulted {{in the loss of}} equipment and all posed potential or real risks to the operator. In 97 cases, the fires raged out of control due to engine shut 2 failure, even upon activation of the machine fire suppression system, due to the spraying of pressurized hydraulic flu 2 and fuel onto hot engine surfaces. In other cases, even after engine shutoff, the fires re-ignited, fueled by the contin 2 flow of flammable fluids remaining in the lines onto the hot engine surfaces. In many of the fires, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> evolved and penetrated the cab, violently igniting, forcing the operator to exit under very hazardous conditions. The use of emergency evacuation lines in the fuel and hydraulic fluid systems, and methods to reduce or prevent the spraying of pressurized fluids onto hot engine surfaces would greatly improve the chances of successfully suppressing large mining equipment fires. In addition, the use of systems for preventing the ignition of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> inside the cab, and detecting and suppressing fires originat 2 in the cab, would greatly enhance operator safety. The National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently conducted experiments on meth 2 to reduce the fire hazards associated with large mining equipment. These experiments evaluated the use of cab inerting systems to prevent the ignition of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> inside the cab and sup 2 fires originating in the cab, while maintaining a breathable atmosphere for the operator to bring the equipment to a stop and safely exit the cab...|$|R
50|$|At present, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> in {{fuel tanks}} are {{rendered}} inert by replacing {{the air in}} the tank with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, nitrogen enriched air, steam or carbon dioxide. This reduces the oxygen concentration of the ullage to below the combustion threshold. Alternate methods based on reducing the ullage fuel-air ratio to below the LFL or increasing the fuel-air ratio to above the UFL have also been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Electrostatic {{discharges}} (other than lightning {{which comes}} from triboelectric charging or ice and water droplets within clouds) cause minimal harm because the energy (V2C) of the spark is very small, being typically several tens of micro joules in cold dry weather, and much less than that in humid conditions; however, such sparks can ignite <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors,</b> see risks and counter-measures. This {{is not the case}} when the capacitance of one of the objects is very large.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Buncefield Incident in 2005 {{led to a}} {{significant}} change in our understanding of how <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> clouds could be generated from overfilling bulk storage tanks with volatile liquids. Prior to that incident, it was widely thought that an overfilling tank would produce a pool of liquid in the bunded area around a tank that would evaporate relatively slowly. However, in the Buncefield Incident, the release of liquid through vents in the tank roof led to waterfall-like cascade of fine gasoline droplets that produced <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> at a much faster rate. It took only around 25  min for the dense current of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> to fill an area roughly 500  m by 400  m to a depth of between 2  m and 4  m. The wind speed was very low during the incident {{and the way in which}} the vapor cloud dispersed was affected by the slope of the ground and presence of obstacles. The resulting explosion was severe, even across open unobstructed areas. Fortunately there were no fatalities, but the total damage from the incident was estimated to have cost around $ 1. 5 billion. Since the Buncefield Incident took place, several incidents with striking similarities have taken place at Jaipur (India), San Juan (Puerto Rico) and the Amuay Refinery (Venezuela). This paper presents the findings of the Buncefield Incident investigation team and further research that has been carried out on tank overfilling releases over the last seven years at the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL). The work has involved a combination of unique spill experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, and has resulted in a simple methodology for predicting the rate of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> production from overfilling tanks. This paper takes the opportunity to present for the first time a unified narrative, starting with the key findings of the incident investigation and culminating with the description of a workbook method for predicting which substances and storage tanks could create significant vapor clouds...|$|E
40|$|Neat {{alcohol fuels}} offer several {{benefits}} over conventional gasoline in automotive applications. However, their low vapor pressure and high {{heat of vaporization}} {{make it difficult to}} produce a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> composition from a neat alcohol fuel during a start under cold ambient conditions. Various methods have been introduced to compensate for this deficiency. In this study, the authors applied computer modeling and simulation to evaluate the potential of four cold-start technologies for engines fueled by near-neat alcohol. The four technologies were a rich combustor device, a partial oxidation reactor, a catalytic reformer, and an enhanced ignition system. The authors ranked the competing technologies by their ability to meet two primary criteria for cold starting an engine at {minus} 25 deg C and also by several secondary parameters related to commercialization. Their analysis results suggest that of the four technologies evaluated, the enhanced ignition system is the best option for further development...|$|E
40|$|The {{document}} presents {{information on}} the maximum total organic carbon (TOC) limits that are allowable in the DWPF melter feed without forming a potentially <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> in the off-gas system were determined at feed rates varying from 0. 7 to 1. 5 GPM. At the maximum TOC levels predicted, the peak concentration of combustible gases in the quenched off-gas will not exceed 60 percent of the lower flammable limit during a 3 X off-gas surge, provided that the indicated melter vapor space temperature and the total air supply to the melter are maintained. All the necessary calculations {{for this study were}} made using the 4 -stage cold cap model and the melter off-gas dynamics model. A high-degree of conservatism was included in the calculational bases and assumptions. As a result, the proposed correlations are believed to by conservative enough to be used for the melter off-gas flammability control purposes...|$|E

40|$|Flammability of {{composite}} materials {{represents one of}} the major bottlenecks in Aviation industry. PVC as a representative charring material and PMMA as a representative non-charring material were considered for this study. The predictive capability of pyrolysis models developed via a calibrated semi-empirical approach is examined through a series of numerical experiments. These configurations feature conditions that are significantly different from the reference conditions used in the model calibration phase. It is found that the domain of validity of semi-empirical pyrolysis models is limited to the conditions that were used during model calibration and that extrapolation to non-calibrated conditions results in a significant error. To further examine the uncertainty in pyrolysis modeling, the effect of unsteady incident radiant heat flux was considered. Results indicate that in a time-average sense, the oscillation in the incoming heat flux does not affect the rate of formation of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor.</b> However, the timeline analysis of charring and non-charrin...|$|E
