40|$|<b>Die</b> <b>casting</b> is {{a common}} method of light metal {{processing}} {{which is used to}} produce accurately dimensioned, sharply defined metal parts. Most <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> in use today utilize a complex hydraulic system to perform the necessary work required for the process. The pressure and flow rate demands on the hydraulic system vary significantly throughout the cycle. Many older systems are greatly oversized so that they are able to meet the peak hydraulic demand at any point. These systems operate inefficiently because there is typically no way to limit the hydraulic capacity during periods of low demand. As a result, fluid is throttled to lower pressures and excess fluid flow is routed directly back to the system reservoir, wasting motor energy and increasing the thermal load on the cooling system. One option for improving the efficiency of older <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> currently in use is the retrofit of an adjustable frequency drive, or AFD. An AFD allows the speed of the pump motor to be varied, changing the pump output to suit the cycle demands. This minimizes the amount of wasted energy without affecting other process parameters. This paper will discuss the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process and examine the energy savings potential of retrofitting <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> with adjustable frequency drives...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigations concerning the influence of negative (relative) pressure in the die cavity of high pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> on the porosity of castings made of AlSi 9 Cu 3 alloy. Examinations were carried out for the VertaCast cold chamber vertical pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> equipped with a vacuum system. Experiments were performed for three values of the applied gauge pressure: - 0. 3 bar, - 0. 5 bar, and - 0. 7 bar, at constant values of other technological parameters, selected during the formerly carried initial experiments. Porosity of castings was assessed on the basis of microstructure observation and the density measurements performed by the method of hydrostatic weighing. The performed investigation allowed to find out that - for the examined pressure range - the porosity of castings decreases linearly with an increase in the absolute value of negative pressure applied to the die cavity. The negative pressure value of - 0. 7 bar allows to produce castings exhibiting porosity value less than 1 %. Large blowholes arisen probably by occlusion of gaseous phase during the injection of metal into the die cavity, were found in castings produced at the negative pressure value of - 0. 3 bar. These blowholes are placed mostly in regions of local thermal centres and often accompanied by the discontinuities in the form of interdendritic shrinkage micro-porosity. It was concluded that the high quality AlSi 9 Cu 3 alloy castings able to work in elevated temperatures can be achieved for the absolute value of the negative pressure applied to the die cavity greater than 0. 5 bar at the applied set of other parameters of pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> work...|$|R

A neural network system is developed to generate the process parameters for the pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process.

The scope of this work includes analysing a physical model of the pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> ® lling stage based on governing equations of die cavity ® lling and the collection of feasible casting data for the training of the network. The training data were generated by using ZN-DA 3 material on a hot chamber <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> with a plunger diameter of 60 mm. The present network was developed using the MATLAB application toolbox. In this work, the neural network was developed by comparing three di€ erent training algorithms: i. e. error backpropagation algorithm; momentum and adaptive learning algorithm; and Levenberg± Marquardt approximation algorithm.

40|$|This thesis work is an {{experimental}} study of one type of Semi-Solid Metal casting (SSM) process which is called RheoMetalTM. This method is an efficient type of Rheocasting that creates a semi-solid slurry within 30 seconds that is used for a high pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> The purpose of using a slurry in a high pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> is that the slurry has a higher viscosity due to its solid fraction. This makes the filling of the die cavity more laminar which reduces air entrapment in the casting. The difficulty {{with this type of}} casting is to control the process parameters to be able to insure a casting with desired properties. A few studies within RheoMetalTM has already been made but there is still a lack of knowledge of to what extent the process parameters affect the slurry. The goal in this work is to study how the different RheoMetalTM process parameters influence the primary α-Al solid fraction, shape and size. The process parameters that were studied in this work was the stirring rate, superheat and EEM amount. In this study, the so called growth layer has been removed to make more precise calculations of the primary α-Al. This work also aims to study how grain refinement affect the primary α-Al which is commonly used {{to improve the quality of}} castings. To be able to perform this study, both practical and theoretical work has been implemented. The casting process involved making of ladles and preparation of various equipment. The cast samples were then prepared by standard metallurgy procedure for optical analyse of the microstructure. A special etching reagent was used to analyse the microstructure in a microscope. The etching is called Weck’s reagent and its purpose is to differentiate the growth layer from the primary α-Al. The growth layer is formed during quenching and by excluding it, the calculation of the slurry’s primary α-Al becomes more precise. This is because the slurry is not quenched before it is inserted into the high pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> therefore no growth layer is formed. To analyse the cast samples, a special program was used to identify and to calculate the solid fraction, shape and size of the primary α-Al. The result from the calculations made by the program gave different tendencies when changing the EEM amount. The stirring rate showed a tendency to decrease the solid fraction and increase the shape factor. The superheat decreased the solid fraction and increased the shape factor. The grain refinement also decreased the solid fraction and increased the shape factor. There was no clear tendency showing that the equivalent circular diameter of the primary α-Al was affected by any of the parameters...|$|R
