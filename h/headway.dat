5|$|The system {{operates}} continually (24/7) with a varying <b>headway</b> {{throughout the}} day. During rush hour (07:00–10:00 and 15:00–18:00), {{there is a}} two-minute <b>headway</b> on the common section and a four-minute <b>headway</b> on the single-service sections. During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00), there is a seven/eight-minute <b>headway</b> on the common section and a fifteen-minute <b>headway</b> on the single-service sections, and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro. At all other times, there is a three-minute <b>headway</b> on the common section and a six-minute on the split sections. Travel time from Nørreport to Vestamager on M1 is 14 minutes, to the airport on M2 is 15 minutes, and to Vanløse on M1 and M2 is 9 minutes. In 2009, the metro transported 50million passengers, or 137,000 per day; by 2013, the metro's ridership increased to 55million.|$|E
5|$|Swift's Blue Line runs at a <b>headway</b> of 12 {{minutes from}} 6:00a.m. to 7:00pm on weekdays, {{its highest level}} of service with five buses per hour per direction. Weekday service begins with a <b>headway</b> of 20 minutes from 5:00a.m. to 6:00am, and ends with the same {{frequency}} during the evening from 7:00p.m. to 10:00pm. During Saturdays, buses run every 20 minutes from 6:00a.m. to 10:00pm. Sunday service, which was suspended from 2010 until 2015, runs from 7:00a.m. to 8:20pm every 20 minutes. The Blue Line initially ran at a 10-minute <b>headway,</b> and had evening service end at midnight, until a major system-wide service reduction in February 2012 reduced its weekday <b>headway</b> to the current 12 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The line is {{operated}} on a four/five-minute <b>headway</b> by all-stops trams, with an eight-minute <b>headway</b> in off-peak times and a 20 minutes <b>headway</b> at night. Travel time from Byparken to Lagunen is 32 minutes. In 2015, the full {{price of a}} single ticket is NOK 35. Tickets are valid with free transfer to buses in Bergen.|$|E
25|$|Very short <b>headways</b> are controversial. The UK Railway Inspectorate has {{evaluated}} the ULTra design {{and is willing}} to accept one-second <b>headways,</b> pending successful completion of initial operational tests at more than 2 seconds. In other jurisdictions, existing rail regulations apply to PRT systems (see CVS, above); these typically calculate <b>headways</b> in terms of absolute stopping distances, which would restrict capacity and make PRT systems unfeasible. No regulatory agency has yet endorsed <b>headways</b> below one second, although proponents believe that regulators may be willing to reduce <b>headways</b> as operational experience increases.|$|R
25|$|Though the Q100 is the limited-stop service {{along the}} corridor, it runs much less {{frequently}} than the Q69. It operates on 10-15 minute <b>headways</b> during daytime hours, 30 minute <b>headways</b> during early mornings and evenings, and 1 hour <b>headways</b> during overnight hours.|$|R

During peak hours, ferries operate or are proposed to operate at 20-minute <b>headways</b> to Astoria and the Lower East Side; 30-minute <b>headways</b> to Bay Ridge and Soundview; and 1-hour <b>headways</b> to the Rockaways (see [...] for more details).|$|R
5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute <b>headway</b> until August, but had a 15-minute <b>headway</b> until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute <b>headway.</b> From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line {{is served}} by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate {{the full length of}} the Sognsvann Line, while line 4 and {{the other half of the}} line 5 trains branch off after Ullevål stadion and serve the Ring Line. All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute <b>headway,</b> except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute <b>headway</b> to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute <b>headway</b> to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|The Trondheim–Steinkjer {{services}} operates with a fixed, hourly, <b>headway</b> {{during the}} day with additional rush-hour services giving a half-hour <b>headway.</b> In the evenings and weekends, there is a two-hour <b>headway.</b> Travel time from Lerkendal to Trondheim S is 10 minutes; from Trondheim S travel time to Trondheim Airport is 35 minutes, to Stjørdal 41 minutes, to Levanger 1 hour and 25 minutes, to Verdal 1 hour and 41 minutes and to Steinkjer 2 hours and 5 minutes. The Trondheim–Røros service is provided five times per day in each direction. From Trondheim S, travel time to Melhus is 24 minutes, to Støren 1 hour and to Røros 2 hours and 25 minutes. A single morning one-direction service is offered from Oppdal to Trondheim S; this service takes 1 hour and 45 minutes. The Mittnabotåget service to Östersund provides two round trips per day, with travel time from Trondheim S to Östersund C 3 hours and 46 minutes. This service is operated jointly between NSB and Veolia Transport.|$|E

50|$|Lines 400 and 500 (along the Østfold, Trunk and Drammen Lines) {{serve the}} {{suburban}} areas of Oslo, and have 30 or 15-minute <b>headways.</b> The other six lines cover towns further away, and normally have 30 or 60-minute <b>headways.</b> Line 450 serves Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|R
5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} connected to Egertorget via Stortorvet. After {{the line was}} taken over by KSS, it was given service number 9 and operated with a twelve-minute <b>headway,</b> connecting via the city center to Skøyen on the Skøyen Line. When the Sinsen Line opened, the souther part of the Rodeløkka was also served by Line 13, which gave a six-minute <b>headway</b> south of Helgesens gate. From 29 June 1924, after the takeover of Oslo Sporveier, the <b>headway</b> was changed to fifteen minutes. From 29 May 1927, Line 13 was replaced with Line 12, and from 19 June, Line 9 became Line 17, which continued along the Ullevål Hageby Line {{on the other side of}} the city center. From 19 January 1937, the Sinsen service was also operated by Line 3. From 10 December 1939, Gullfisk trams were put into service on the Sinsen services. With the reopening of the Rodeløkka Line in 1955, the service {{was taken over by}} Line 13, which used SM53 trams. Ridership on the new line was less than predicted, and from 1959, the line was only served during rush-hour and started to turn at the Eastern Railway Station in the city center.|$|E
5|$|Two of the lines, 400 and 500, are {{designated}} as providing inner services. These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker, along the Trunk Line to Lillestrøm and the Østfold Line to Ski, stopping at all stations. The six other line, {{which make up}} the outer services, only make occasional stops on these sections. The inner services operate with a normal <b>headway</b> of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour. In late evening {{and parts of the}} weekend, this is further reduced to 60 minutes. NSB's outer routes operate with a normal <b>headway</b> of 60 minutes, with rush-hour services offered at 30-minute intervals and late evening service provided every 120 minutes. Services between Årnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services, and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services. The Gjøvik Line runs with a 40-minute <b>headway,</b> with three different stopping patterns. One calls at all stations until Hakadal, one calls at most stations until Jaren, while one is an express service that runs the line's full length to Gjøvik.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which {{had been unable to}} make any <b>headway</b> against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) <b>headways</b> for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute <b>headways</b> at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak <b>headways</b> to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, NSB {{started using}} Class 93 diesel {{multiple}} units on intercity trains, retiring the Di3. In March 2000, NSB announced {{the closing of}} several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only {{two percent of the}} traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly <b>headway</b> was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT Røstad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour <b>headway.</b> The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, an {{addition}} 15 units were ordered by Oslo, with {{an option for}} further orders later. This will allow all the eastern lines to have a 7.5-minute <b>headway</b> on their services into the city center, instead of the current 15-minute <b>headway.</b> Trains would start using the balloon loop located at Stortinget, and the western lines {{will continue to have}} a 15-minute <b>headway.</b> At the same time, the trains serving the Ring Line will be extended to six cars. The order cost NOK675 million. In addition, Akershus finalized their order for five units, costing NOK240 million. Unlike the Oslo-owned units, Akershus' five units will be owned by the transit authority Ruter. The same year, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkoll Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to Holmenkollen during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This allowed 9,000people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. In 2009, the T2000 units were taken out of service, and on 22 April 2010 the last T1300 was taken out of service, making the MX3000 the only units to be used on the Oslo Metro. The city council was considering ordering 15 additional MX3000 to replace the T2000, as an alternative for a NOK50-million renovation.|$|E
