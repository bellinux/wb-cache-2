40|$|In {{the current}} paper, we apply a {{citation}} analysis, a limited content analysis and {{an analysis of}} authorship to {{the first decade of}} the European Accounting Review (EAR). Based on results from our citation analysis, we conclude that EAR contributed to the advancement of accounting knowledge. In its first decade, <b>EAR</b> <b>covered</b> a wide variety of research topics, which are found to be representative of the European accounting research community. Whereas authorship in EAR is centred in only relatively few countries, contributions originate from a total of 34 countries. Overall, our findings align with the journal’s aims and scope. accounting journal; citation analysis; content analysis; authorship networks; European Accounting Review; journal influence...|$|R
40|$|This study empirically {{tests the}} {{prediction}} that the echolocation calls of gleaning insectivorous bats (short duration, high frequency, low intensity) are acoustically mismatched to {{the ears of}} noctuid moths and are less detectable than those of aerially hawking bats. We recorded auditory receptor cell action potentials elicited in underwing moths (Catocalaspp.) by echolocation calls emitted during gleaning attacks by Myotis septentrionalis(the northern long-eared bat) and during flights by the aerial hawker Myotis lucifugus(the little brown bat). The moth ear responds inconsistently and with fewer action potentials to the echolocation calls emitted by the gleaner, a situation that worsened when the moth’s <b>ear</b> was <b>covered</b> by its wing (mimicking a moth resting on a surface). Calls emitted by the aerial-hawking bat elicited a significantly stronger spiking response from the moth ear. Moths with their <b>ears</b> <b>covered</b> by their wings maintained their relative hearing sensitivity at their best frequency range, the range used by most aerial insectivorous bats, but showed a pronounced deafness in the frequency range typically employed by gleaning bats. Our results (1) support the prediction that the echolocation calls of gleaners are acoustically inconspicuous to the ears of moths (and presumably other nocturnal tympanate insects), leaving the moths particularly vulnerable to predation, and (2) suggest that gleaners gain a foraging advantage against eared prey...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the purpose of helping to clarify the poorly understood relationship between stover forage quality and stalk strength and plant traits associated with stalk strength of corn (Zea mays L.);Seven hybrids {{with a wide range of}} stalk strength (male-sterile with <b>ears</b> <b>covered,</b> normal counterpart, male-sterile with ears, prolific hybrid, and the zero, first, and third cycles of selection for stalk strength from a synthetic variety) were grown at two locations, Ames and Nashua, Iowa, 1983. They were planted at three population densities (about 32, 000, 64, 000, 96, 000 plants ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1)), and harvested at mid-silking and at physiological maturity. The experimental design was a split-split plot with three replications;The variables measured were crushing strength; rind thickness; sugar concentration of the sap; stalk moisture for the first harvest; and length, diameter, and volume of the second elongated intermode from the bottom. Also, concentration of acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) of the whole internode, rind, and pith, and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) of different plant parts of the corn plant (whole internode, rind, pith, and stover). Stover dry matter yield and grain yield were also determined;The results showed that stalk strength seems to be a complex phenomenon. Rind thickness, which implies a strength factor, was by far the trait most closely associated with crushing strength. Sugar concentration, which implies a healthier stalk with more resistance to pests, and a possible strength aspect of higher turgor potential, was greatest in the strongest stalk hybrids. Stalk diameter might have accounted for the decrease in stalk strength from increasing population densities. Forage quality (ADF, ADL, and IVDMD) of the whole internode, rind, pith, and stover was not adversely affected by stalk strength. Stover yield was greatest in the male sterile with <b>ears</b> <b>covered</b> and was least in the prolific. There was no clear sacrifice in grain yield by increasing stalk strength, and male sterility was responsible for the greatest yields under stress conditions. The prolific hybrid also showed relatively high yields...|$|R
