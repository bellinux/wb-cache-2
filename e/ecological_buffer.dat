40|$|An economic-ecological map for Nenets {{community}} tribal lands at the Russian Arctic coast wetlands was compiled. Wetlands {{supply a}} large variety of ecosystem services beneficial to ecological stability and biological resources for indigenous population support. Ecosystem services assessed {{in this project}} were mainly regulating: carbon deposition by different ecosystems (climate regulation function due to CO 2 consumption), water purification and “warming” effect of bogs. This list was limited by data and assessment methods availability. We used traditional methods for ecological services assessment, based on their existing and possible (virtual) market prices. Mapping approaches were based on Target 2 Action 5 Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Proportional value regulating services of peat bogs appeared to be nearly the same as maximal existing lands value. Our assessment results enabled us to present spatial dimensions of ecosystem services of community-tribal lands, whose value appeared {{to be higher than}} compensatory sums for “lost profit” in case they are replaced by oil extraction infrastructure. Traditional nature management lands may be regarded as an alternative to further primarily industrial land use type and attribute <b>ecological</b> <b>buffers</b> role to them as well as indigenous population material and spiritual support functions...|$|R

Adjacent to Humbug Marsh is an 18 -ha former industrial manufacturing site (now called the Refuge Gateway) that is being remediated and restored as an <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> for Humbug Marsh and the future home of the refuge’s visitor center. Restoration and redevelopment activities have included: cleanup and capping of contaminated lands; daylighting a creek (i. e. , deliberately exposing the flow of a creek that was historically placed underground in a culvert) and constructing a retention pond and emergent wetland to treat storm water prior to discharge to the Detroit River; restoring coastal wetland, riparian buffer, and upland habitats; and constructing two roads, hiking/biking trails, and a kayak/canoe landing to offer wildlife-compatible public uses that allow visitors to experience this internationally-recognized natural resource. This project has been described as transformational for the region by restoring an industrial brownfield into high quality wildlife habitat that expands the <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> of a Ramsar site. Specific restoration targets for the site include: achieving a net gain of 6. 5 ha of wetlands in a river that has lost 97 % of its coastal wetlands to development; restoring 10. 1 ha of upland buffer habitat; treating invasive Phragmites along 4 km of shoreline; and treatment of invasive plant species in 20. 2 ha of upland habitats in Humbug Marsh. Further, the Refuge Gateway is being restored as a model of environmental sustainability for nearly seven million residents within a 45 -minute drive. Key lessons learned include: reach broad-based agreement on a sustainability vision; identify and involve a key champion; establish core project delivery team; ensure up-front involvement of regulatory agencies; recruit and meaningfully involve many partners; expect the unexpected; practice adaptive management; place a priority on sound science-based decision making; ensure decision-making transparency; measure and celebrate successes, including benefits; and place a high priority on education and outreach. ...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated {{sea-level rise}} and {{increased}} intensity of tropical storm events have challenged the conventional approaches to conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems. In coastal communities, where survival will depend {{largely on the}} ability of species to adapt to rapidly shifting conditions or become established farther inland, historic assemblages may be lost. Seed banks may be an important component of resilience and recovery in response to altered inundation regimes, should they contain species able to adapt or migrate inland. This study assess the ability of seed banks to act as <b>ecological</b> <b>buffers</b> to storm surge disturbances and to instill ecological resilience in degraded and vulnerable coastal ecosystems. Above-ground, seed bank and propagule assemblages were surveyed from historic communities at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Artificial storm surge experiments revealed that that seed banks were not well distributed throughout the coastal transition communities and that seed bank responses following storm surges are likely to vary among the different plant communities. While some relict species are expected to respond following disturbances, ruderal species are especially dominant in the upland seed bank communities and may, {{at least in the short}} term, cause shifts away from the historical assemblages. The apparent absence of seaward species in the upland seed banks may make assisted migration an important tool for the survival of communities unable to keep pace. Community response following translocation of propagule bank application onto highly degraded buyout properties suggested that this technique may be an effective tool in introducing resilience into ecosystems already experiencing the effects of climate change. They resulted in the establishment of diverse and variable communities, containing indicator species from a number of historic communities with varying environmental tolerances. Long-term monitoring of community change and reproductive output of target species may indicate the utility of community translocation in creating resilient and future-adapted communities...|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{restoration}} has {{the potential}} to mitigate habitat loss and fragmentation. However, restoration can take decades to reach the ecological conditions of the target habitats. The National Trust’s Stonehenge Landscape Restoration Project provides an opportunity to evaluate the ecological benefits against the economic and temporal costs. A field survey between June and September 2010 using Lepidoptera as bio-indicators showed that restored grasslands can approach the ecological conditions of the target chalk grassland habitat within 10 years. However, specialist species like Lysandra bellargus (Adonis blue) were absent from restored grasslands and may require additional management to assist their colonisation. Analysis of the Lepidoptera communities showed that both small-scale habitat heterogeneity and age of the habitat were important for explaining Lepidoptera occurrence. These results demonstrate that habitat restoration at the landscape scale combined with appropriate site-scale management can be a relatively rapid and effective method to restore <b>ecological</b> networks and <b>buffer</b> against future climate change...|$|R

In this study, theoretical and technical frameworks of regionalisation on the eco-environmental function of the river systems were preliminarily formulated. According to the river eco-environmental functions, Luanhe River was regionalised into four types of first-class functional areas, i. e., ecological preservation areas, habitat restoration areas, <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> areas and development and utilisation areas. Combined with the main functions of all functional areas, ecological land use of the river system in Luanhe River was assessed and planned. The total area of basic ecological land use was 876. 98 km 2 ; that of restrictive ecological land use was 1745. 52 km 2 ; that of ecological land use of the river system returned from farmland was 284. 25 km 2 ; and that returned from construction land was 17. 35 km 2 . Combined with prototype observation experiments, the average minimum ecological flow of mainstreams in upper and middle reaches of the Luanhe River was 4. 896 m 3 s− 1 with the habitat method. The evaporation and seepage consumption of the river system in Luanhe River and vegetation consumption in riparian zones were about 133 million m 3 and 145 million m 3 per year, respectively. Downwards from the Panjiakou-Daheiting Reservoir system, the mainstream of the Luanhe River was the crucial reach for regulation on instream ecological water use.

40|$|Papyrus swamps form <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> zones at the land-water interface, {{protecting}} lake shallows from sedimentation {{and reducing}} the risk of eutrophication in open water. Many communities living near papyrus swamps, particularly in East Africa, derive socioeconomic benefits from these highly productive ecosystems. Loss of the buffering capacity of papyrus at Lake Naivasha, Kenya, explains much of the observed increase in the lake’s trophic state. Multiple authors have called for Naivasha’s wetlands to be restored; however, the social and ecological factors that would need to be considered before doing so have received insufficient attention. Case studies of recent restoration programmes at Lake Victoria illustrate the means by which degraded wetlands can be rehabilitated. Analysis of attitudes towards papyrus at Lake Naivasha reveals a general lack of awareness surrounding the benefits of local wetlands, forming a potential barrier to successful restoration there. An assessment of the lake’s riparian zone demonstrates that both anthropogenic and natural pressures present significant challenges for the survival of lake-fringing wetlands, highlighting changes that have occurred within the ecosystem over the last few decades. Potential means of addressing both the social and ecological limitations to papyrus restoration are offered, with explicit linkages to the benefits of doing so made clear. Floating islands are shown to be the most appropriate reference for ecological restoration at Lake Naivasha, which can be replicated through artificial technology. The establishment of a consumptive use value for harvested papyrus at Naivasha would help to raise stakeholders’ awareness of wetlands; a novel means of producing biomass briquettes was met with positive responses from local residents and may be used to encourage community participation in restoration. A vision for wise use of this internationally renowned Ramsar site is set out, with recommendations made as to how papyrus wetlands could be managed sustainably over the long term.

40|$|Reduction in {{seawater}} pH due {{to rising}} levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the world's oceans {{is a major}} force set to shape the future of marine ecosystems and the ecological services they provide [1, 2]. In particular, ocean acidification is predicted to have a detrimental effect on the physiology of calcifying organisms [3]. Yet, the indirect effects of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, which may counter or exacerbate direct effects, is uncertain. Using volcanic CO 2 vents, we tested the indirect effects of ocean acidification on a calcifying herbivore (gastropod) within the natural complexity of an ecological system. Contrary to predictions, the abundance of this calcifier was greater at vent sites (with near-future CO 2 levels). Furthermore, translocation experiments demonstrated that ocean acidification did not drive increases in gastropod abundance directly, but indirectly {{as a function of}} increased habitat and food (algal biomass). We conclude that the effect of ocean acidification on algae (primary producers) can have a strong, indirect positive influence on the abundance of some calcifying herbivores, which can overwhelm any direct negative effects. This finding points to the need to understand <b>ecological</b> processes that <b>buffer</b> the negative effects of environmental change...|$|R
40|$|The Nebraska Sandhills are {{the largest}} sand dune system in the Western Hemisphere, and are unique because they remain {{relatively}} undisturbed from row crop agriculture. Research {{in the past two}} decades demonstrated that the Sandhills are dynamic on millennial timescales, switching between stabilized, vegetated states to non-vegetated, mobilized states. The Sandhills are currently stabilized, but understanding how ecological processes are altered as sand dunes transition from stabilized to mobilized states, provides insight into the thresholds, stability, and resilience of this grassland ecosystem. My research investigated the impacts of vegetation disturbances on ecological processes and the sand dune surface stability. For ten years (2005 - 2014), Press, Pulse, Grazed, and Control treatments were applied to stabilized sand dunes. Press treatments killed vegetation and prevented re-growth, while Pulse treatments killed vegetation in one year and then allowed two years of recovery. I measured changes in key ecosystem processes (aboveground biomass, nitrogen cycling, soil respiration, and total soil C and N pools) as sand dunes transitioned from stable to mobile states. I found that Press vegetation disturbances surpassed the grassland’s resilience and led to mobile sand dunes after 4 - 5 years. However, there was a time lag between complete loss of aboveground vegetation and increased erosion, which indicated that belowground <b>ecological</b> functioning <b>buffers</b> disturbances and is important in controlling sand dune surface stability. The Pulse treatment reduced aboveground biomass and shifted the system to an annual and C 3 grass dominated plant community, but belowground functioning continued at reduced rates and erosion was minimal. However, in the 11 th year of the study, the spatial variance in erosion activity increased, potentially foreshadowing a state shift in the Pulse treatment. A severe drought in 2012 produced similar impacts on ecosystem processes as the Pulse treatment, reducing aboveground biomass and increasing the contribution of forbs. The 2012 drought also increased available soil nitrate and ammonium, reduced net N mineralization and soil CO 2 flux, but did not cause measurable erosion. My results indicate that the Nebraska Sandhills are resilient to climate and vegetation disturbances on decadal timescales, and that continued belowground functioning is critical to the stability of this ecosystem. ...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization is an {{inevitable}} phenomenon in today's world, but {{urban and suburban}} areas are growing {{at the expense of}} ecological systems. Because these regions produce many environmental problems, urbanized areas need a new approach to weave natural systems with built contexts. Parks and their systems are a means to incorporate urban ecology in suburban settings. Urban ecology allows cities to identify and protect vulnerable, sustainable, and regenerative natural systems in urbanized cities. This creative project seeks to develop a Midwestern conceptual urban park system based on spatial urban ecology in the Indianapolis suburbs of Carmel, Fishers, and Noblesville. Exploring how spatial ecology can be mutually beneficial and sustainable for nature and the built context, the park system will be developed based on <b>ecological</b> systems, including <b>buffers,</b> woodlands, grasslands, and wetlands. The ecological-based park model expands Frederic Law Olmsted's philosophy about parks and park systems and level-of-service (LOS) for recreational and park facilities. By testing principles of his model, spatial ecology provides an example for a park system with urban planning in Midwestern suburbs. Because hydrology is an important natural system to serve circulation, it {{plays a key role in}} this project. This project applies green infrastructure to suburban lands for improving natural systems within suburban regions. The proposed park model with urban ecology includes benefits of ecological systems in urban regions by creating sustainable natural environments. Department of Landscape ArchitectureThesis (M. L.

40|$|Land buyout {{programs}} {{may be used}} to significantly improve climate resilience by creating a protective <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> area to protect land at high risk of flooding. This thesis assesses the success of the New York State land buyout on the East Shore of Staten Island in achieving this resilient outcome. The New York State buyout program was created after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 in response to pressure from landowners who had been flooded in the storm. New York City declined to participate in a buyout in response to Sandy but offered to acquire storm-damaged homes in other areas where the New York State buyout was not offered. Through the New York City program, acquired properties would be resold to private entities at auction. In contrast, the New York State program, which purchased 37 acres of land within the 100 -year floodplain, was legally bound to hold the properties bought through their program as open space in perpetuity. The state was able to promise former residents that their land would become a buffer for inland areas, increasing resilience along this vulnerable coastline. I analyze the success of the state program in achieving this goal by assessing participation and attrition rates within designated buyout areas, as well as reasons for attrition. I find that the lack of coordinated goals and agreed-upon tools prevented New York Rising from successfully achieving the highest measure of resilience: creating a coastal buffer area to protect residents from sea level rise and future flooding. by Sonja K.

It benefits urban communities environmentally, esthetically, recreationally and economically. Beijing Province is in north of China, and has a total area of 16, 807. 8 km(2) and a population of about 13. 8 million. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for urban greening of Beijing Province based on landscape ecological principles. It attempts to answer how to establish an urban greening plan at the regional, city and neighborhood levels to achieve long-term sustainability. At the regional level, a big natural and semi-natural forest area in the northwest and an <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> belt in the southeast are planned to protect the environmental quality of Beijing and provide habitats for wildlife. At the city level, a green network system of green wedges, parks and green corridors has been proposed. This green network helps to limit future urban expansion, improve urban environmental quality and serve as habitats and migration routes for wildlife. At the neighborhood level, green extensions and connections of riverside greenway, road greenway, parks and vertical greening permeate into the built-up areas. They provide open space close to residential areas and offer places for recreation. This three-level green system constitutes an integrated ecological network for urban sustainable development of Beijing. For future development of Beijing, urban parks, forestry, agriculture, water and infrastructure should be planned and designed in an integrated way. After this greenspace plan is legislated and completely realized, Beijing will develop an interconnected and integrated network of urban greenspaces. It has the prospect of achieving the aim of "Green Olympic City 2008 " and the long-term goal of developing Beijing towards an "Eco-City". (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this study, theoretical and technical frameworks for regionalization on the eco-environmental function of river systems are formulated and applied to the Luanhe River system. Based on its eco-environmental functions, this river can be regionalized into four types of first-class functional areas: ecological preservation areas, habitat restoration areas, <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> areas and development and utilization areas. Considering the overall eco-environmental functions, we assessed the ecological land use of the Luanhe River system. The total area of basic ecological land use is 876. 98 km 2 ; the restrictive ecological land use is 1745. 52 km 2 ; ecological land use of the river system returned from farmland is 284. 25 km 2 ; and that returned from construction land is 17. 35 km 2 . The average minimum ecological flow of mainstreams in upper and middle reaches of the Luanhe River is 4. 896 m 3 s− 1 based on the habitat method. And the recommended minimum and suitable annual ecological water demand of channels in the lower reaches are 391 million m 3 and 819. 5 million m 3 , respectively. The evaporation and seepage consumption and vegetation consumption in riparian zones of the Luanhe River system are approximately 132. 6 million m 3 and 145. 3 million m 3 per year, respectively. Our results suggest that is crucial to regulate the instream ecological water use of the Luanhe River's mainstream starting from the Panjiakou-Daheiting Reservoir system.

The <b>buffer</b> zones perpendicular to the watercourse were defined along both riversides at a 5 -km interval beginning from the watercourse (10 km wider) using the method of the buffer zone analysis. The landscape pattern indexes of each buffer zone were calculated, and the indexes of the main landscape patterns were analyzed so as to reveal the radiative effect and the characteristics of the river corridors on landscape and patch levels. The results show that the radiative width is generally 30 km in the study area, and can be up to 50 - 70 km in sub-region FG 1 because the study area is located in two drainage basins, with an ecological interstitial zone between them. The landscapes of woodlands and wetlands are generally distributed within the 10 km buffer zone (it means that the buffer zone is 5 km away from the watercourse; the same hereafter) along both riversides. Moreover, the closer the buffer zone is to the watercourse, the higher the patch density and the largest patch index are.

There are many protected landscapes in this territory, including reserves and other specially protected landscapes. However, the network of such specially protected natural resources can not fully satisfy the resources they consume and simultaneously maintain a favorable ecological situation in the region. The results of studies of the prospects and prerequisites for the formation and preservation of the landscape-ecological framework of the South-Western Crimea have been presented. Various groups of factors that negatively affect the ecological state of the region are analyzed, among them construction in coastal protective bands, recreational digression of soils and vegetation, pollution with industrial wastewater, illegal sand sampling, etc. Assessment of nature use structures has shown that the existing system needs landscape-ecological justification and planning. The structure of the landscape-ecological framework of the South-Western Crimea has been developed. Its elements have been identified, which contain natural “cores” subject to special protection, <b>ecological</b> corridors and <b>buffer</b> zones. In the course of the study, a mapping of the landscapeecological planning organization of the coastal territory of the Crimean coast has been carried out.

The habitat value of buffer strips, however, {{has not received}} much attention, although riparian forests belong to the systems with the highest biodiversity in these regions. We used plants as indicators of the ability of buffer strips to maintain an environment similar to intact riparian forests in a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. We measured the growth of three common bryophyte species (Hylocomiastrum umbratum, Calypogeia integristipula, and Tritomaria quinquedentata) transplanted to riparian habitat close to a stream in clear-cut logged sites 10 - 15 m wide buffer strips {{on each side of}} the stream, and intact (reference) sites. Each of the three site categories included six wet and six tnoist-mesic sites and the experiment was followed over three months in 1999. The species remained vital in the reference sites and grew substantially during the 3 -mo-long experiment, but in the logged sites almost no growth was registered, and many shoots died (except for T. qninquedentata). The pattern was consistent irrespective of the ground moisture class. The performance of bryophytes in the moist-mesic buffer strips was almost as bad as in the logged sites, whereas in the wet buffer strips it was either intermediate between that in logged and reference sites (H. umbratum) or very similar to that in reference sites (C. integristipula and T. quinquedentata). The edge effect has previously been shown to vary depending on edge orientation, edge physiognomy, and weather conditions. We found that ground moisture can be of major importance as well. Although many buffer strips function better than no strips, 20 - 30 m wide strips (with a stream in the middle) through a logged area consist entirely of edge habitat. Increasing the buffer width and avoiding clear-cut logging on both sides of a watercourse would be the first steps to take for improving biodiversity conservation in riparian habitats. Our results also show that bryophytes are good indicators of habitat quality and efficient tools for assessing the <b>ecological</b> function of <b>buffer</b> strips...|$|R

This study therefore assessed the challenges of buffer zone management in some (adjacent) support zone communities in Oban Division of Cross River National Park, Nigeria. Data were obtained through questionnaire interviews and reconnaissance survey and subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results showed that a high percentage (68. 68 %) of the respondents in the division were not aware of the existence of the buffer zone and the policies governing it. 74. 42 % believed that the Park has left them poorer.

A chi-square analysis showed that the people were not aware of the existence, creation and policy governing buffer zone management and were therefore not in favour of its operations. These developments might be adduced to the low level of awareness of Park laws and buffer zone management policies by these communities. It is therefore recommended that public enlightenment campaigns should be stepped up to educate the populace on the need to abide by the laws and policies governing the Park and its buffer zone. Social amenities including classroom blocks, health centers, roads, water and electricity should be provided by the management of the park including training in a number of livelihood options like beekeeping and non timber forest product farming.

Whale watching vessels are widely recognized as a suitable platform for collecting ample dataset about cetacean distribution, but do they perform well even with elusive species? In this study we used Cuvier’s beaked whale distribution data collected during whale watching trips in the Ligurian Sea, (NW Mediterranean Sea) from 2004 to 2007. Generalized Additive Models have been used to describe species habitat preferences and in particular to inspect the role of submarine canyons in structuring its distribution. Different topographic variables have been used as environmental descriptors and a novel GIS methodologies have been applied for the identification of canyon axis and canyon basins.

Accelerated erosion threatens the stability of these regions and {{a greater understanding of}} the interacting processes is vital to the preservation of coastal marshes. The central objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the impacts of wave energy, vegetation, and soil properties on coastal marsh edge erosion. To accomplish this, the first objective was to quantify tidal marsh edge erosion across temporal and spatial scales using TLS. The second objective was to evaluate the relationships between marsh edge erosion and incident wave energy. The final objective was to assess the correlation between vegetation roots and marsh edge erosion as well as the correlation between soil properties and marsh edge erosion. The study area is on an eroding edge of a salt marsh wetland known as Anchor Bay, located at the terrestrial-aquatic interface of Galveston Island and West Bay specifically, between Melager Cove and Oxen Bayou. Galveston Island is a barrier island on the Texas Gulf Coast, located about 50 miles southeast of Houston, Texas, U. S. A. Many methods were used to accomplish the objectives including LIDAR and photographic surveying, point cloud change analysis, wave modeling, image classification and soil analysis for bulk density, percent organic matter, and sediment grain size. Overall, lateral marsh edge erosion at the study site for the duration of the study was relatively large with greater than 1 meter of erosion observed at the study site in a 318 day period. Wave heights, as driven by wind direction and speed, affected the erosion at the study site. The site was prone to greater erosion when winds blew from the east-northeast to the north directions, and from the north-northwest to the west directions. While root concentration did not play an apparent role in preventing erosion, soil properties did have some influence on erosion...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate the <b>ecological</b> consequences of <b>buffer</b> strip retention on riparian and terrestrial biodiversity. Earlier studies on forest buffer strips have evaluated their effectiveness in relation to water quality and aquatic biota. However, forests along streams are species rich habitats for many organism groups. Buffer strip management {{is assumed to be}} important also for protecting such species. Current approaches to biodiversity-oriented forest management practices need to be scientifically evaluated. In this thesis the effects on bryophytes and land snails have been evaluated. A before-and-after experiment along 15 small streams in northern Sweden showed that buffer strips of 10 m {{on each side of the}} stream moderated the negative effects exhibited at the clear-cuts. The number of land snail species remained similar as to before logging and the number of vanished bryophyte species was lower in the buffer strips than in the clear-cuts. The ground moisture influenced the survival rate of land snails at the clear-cuts. At mesic sites many species vanished but at wet sites the snail fauna was unaffected by the logging. Many bryophyte species, most of them liverworts, decreased or disappeared in the buffer strips. These were mostly growing on substrates elevated from the forest floor, such as logs, stumps and tree-bases. A number of nationally red-listed species, sensitive for changes in microclimate, were among those decreasing most. Thus, for the species in most need of protection the buffer strips were too narrow. An experiment with bryophyte transplants followed over a season showed that wet ground moisture moderated the negative edge effects in narrow buffer strips. On the other hand, the growth in mesic and moist sites was almost as low as in comparable clear-cuts. Microclimatic edge effects are stronger at south facing than north-facing edges of forest clear-cuts. This was shown in an experiment using bryophyte growth as an indicator of differences in microclimate. However, the depth of edge influence seemed to be similar between north- and south-facing forest edges, > 30 m for one species. An explanation for this could be that wind penetrates deeper into edges than solar radiation and has a more variable direction. In conclusion, narrow buffer strips consist entirely of edge habitat. For many species the environment in buffer strips is good enough for persistence. For others, most notably bryophyte species on convex substrates, wider buffer strips are needed to ensure long-term survival...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Anthropology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The Medieval Warm Period or, alternately, the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) {{has been}} {{extensively}} cited in archaeological literature as an explanation {{in whole or in}} part for observations of change in human health and behavior. The MCA was a long-term, low-frequency global warming pattern that is known through paleoclimatic data to have occurred during approximately A. D. 800 - 1350 in central California. A synthesis of bioarchaeological data on 15, 255 skeletons reported from excavations conducted at 298 archaeological sites in northern California between 1867 and 2009 is used to assess whether prehistoric populations in the region were negatively impacted by droughts during the MCA. Population-level health and behavioral indices tabulated as proxy measures of stress before, during, and after the MCA included age, sex, enamel hypoplasia, anemia, dental caries, disease, fractures, violence, and mass inhumations. Results of the study indicate that the health of indigenous populations significantly deteriorated during the MCA relative to temporal phases before and after this event in central California. In addition, a fine-grained temporal analysis demonstrates a diachronic pattern of increased health stress from AD 735 to AD 1390. The prevalence rates of dental caries, enamel hypoplasia, anemia, disease, fractures, and interpersonal violence all exhibit significant increases during the middle (AD 1010 - 1210) and late (AD 1210 - 1390) phases of the MCA. The prevalence rates of dental caries, enamel hypoplasia, disease, fractures, and interpersonal violence all exhibit significant decreases following this climatic event (AD 1390 - 1700). Anemia is the only index that continues to increase following the MCA. Mass burials, while exhibiting significant temporal variability in prevalence at the sub-regional level, proved to be a poor indicator of health stress at this level of analysis for the larger central California region. Sub-regions within central California exhibit diachronic and geographic variability in index prevalence rates throughout the temporal sequence established for the region. This variability was not unexpected given the diverse <b>ecological</b> and cultural <b>buffers</b> that could mitigate particular health stress index prevalence rates in particular areas. However, during the MCA, the Sacramento Valley and San Francisco Bay (the only two regions with adequate sample size for comparative analysis at the micro-scale) demonstrate significant continuity with the high prevalence rates observed among indices of the larger region. These findings are significant, as during no other phase in the temporal sequence can one observe diverse environmental, cultural, and dietary resource zones exhibiting such similarity in health stress marker types and prevalence. The linear pulse of index frequency observed on both the sub-regional and regional level from the Early MCA (AD 735 - 1010) through the Late MCA (AD 1210 - 1390) cannot be dismissed as the result of regular patterned increases of the sort expected from population increase and resource intensification during this time. This study has demonstrated that there was a significant increase in health stress during the MCA that abruptly ended following the termination of this event. These increases in health stress cannot be adequately explained through resource intensification, socio-cultural political organization, or territorial constriction, as these processes were in place well before and after this event. It is concluded that these negative impacts result from the effects of the MCA on populations in central California. Anthropolog...|$|R
40|$|Species {{interactions}} {{are an integral}} part of ecological communities. Collectively, these interactions form complex and highly dynamic networks. The structure of these networks varies due to geographic and temporal variation in the abundance and co-occurrence of interacting species and due to species gains and losses after anthropogenic perturbation. In Europe’s last relict of old-growth lowland forest (Białowieża, Poland), I studied the outcomes of these natural and human-induced dynamics in highly diversified mutualistic networks of plants, pollinators and seed dispersers. These mutualistic interactions between plants and free-living animals are of great importance, as the flowers and fruits of many plant species are critical resources for a variety of animal species, which in turn contribute significantly to the regeneration of plant communities. As part of my studies, I was able to show that plant–animal mutualistic networks are highly dynamic systems that respond collectively to changing biotic context and human-induced perturbation. Observed shifts in facilitative and competitive interactions among plants sharing mutualistic partners show that biotic context is a strong determinant of the outcome of interspecific interactions. The use of network analyses, thereby, allowed me to identify some of the mechanisms that shape species interactions and their outcomes. For example, my studies show that a change in the population density of one species suffices to trigger cascading effects on the interactions and populations of other species. This finding highlights that species interactions may have a pervasive effect on the assembly and disassembly of ecological communities. Even more importantly, I could show that these community-wide dynamics were in all cases linked to consumer-resource relationships, which are key determinants of plant–animal mutualisms. Thus, changes in the foraging behaviour of animals in response to variation in the density of plant resources and competitors affected the structure of mutualistic communities. This underscores that despite the evolutionary conservatism in ecological interactions, biotic context determines to which extent these coevolved {{interactions are}} realized. The fact that the sharing of mutualistic partners among plant species was reflected in their co-occurrence demonstrates that the above-mentioned dynamics in ecological networks may also determine community assembly processes and species co-existence. Importantly, the comparison of several types of species interactions revealed how biotic context in its various forms can shape land-use effects on species interactions. I found that the mutualism between plants and seed dispersers was more susceptible to habitat degradation than the mutualism between plants and their pollinators. This finding highlights that a high degree of generalization, such as in the seed dispersal mutualism, does not necessarily <b>buffer</b> <b>ecological</b> communities against the loss of species. This becomes even more important if a few species have a disproportionate effect on a given target function and if species are particularly vulnerable to ecological perturbation, such as habitat specialists or large-bodied frugivores. Furthermore, I observed that shifts in the abundance of plant resources in degraded habitats can amplify land-use effects on plant–animal mutualistic interactions. Importantly, changes in the density of plant resources explained about 40 to 70 percent of the variation in land-use effects on interactions between plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers. This demonstrates that a consideration of biotic context (e. g. in the form of resources) may considerably improve predictions of the magnitude of land-use effects on species interactions. Thereby, the correlated responses of pollinators and seed dispersers to the shifts in plant population densities in degraded habitats highlight that these dynamics are not restricted to single types of interaction, but potentially operate at the level of ecosystems. Studies that only focus on subsets of species or interaction types may be unable to identify the consequences of human land-use that have been shown here. In principle, the results of the presented studies may also be valid for other types of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions that are based on consumer-resource relationships. Altogether, the results of my thesis suggest that natural and human-induced dynamics in plant–animal mutualistic networks follow similar principles. In the worst case these dynamics might have cascading effects on the functioning and integrity of ecosystems through a parallel loss of multiple animal-mediated ecosystem services after habitat degradation...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{ecological}} vulnerability {{is measured}} {{on the basis}} of ecological sensitivity and resilience based on the concept analysis of vulnerability. GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) methods are used, supported by the spatial analysis tools of GIS, to define different levels of vulnerability for areas of the urban ecology. These areas are further classified into different types of regulatory zones. Taking the city of Hefei in China as the empirical research site, this study uses GIS-MCDA, including the index system, index weights and overlay rules, to measure the degree of its ecological vulnerability on the GIS platform. There are eight indices in the system. Raking and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methods are used to calculate index weights according to the characteristics of the index system. The integrated overlay rule, including selection of the maximum value, and weighted linear combination (WLC) are applied as the overlay rules. In this way, five types of vulnerability areas have been classified as follows: very low vulnerability, low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, high vulnerability and very high vulnerability. They can be further grouped into three types of regulatory zone of ecological green line, ecological grey line and ecological red line. The study demonstrates that ecological green line areas are the largest (53. 61 % of the total study area) and can be intensively developed; ecological grey line areas (19. 59 % of the total area) can serve as the <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> zone, and ecological red line areas (26. 80 %) cannot be developed and must be protected. The results indicate that ecological green line areas may provide sufficient room for future urban development in Hefei city. Finally, the respective regulatory countermeasures are put forward. This research provides a scientific basis for decision-making around urban ecological protection, construction and sustainable development. It also provides theoretical method references for future research into urban ecological vulnerability, including the introduction of GIS-MCDA methods into the field of urban ecological vulnerability, which expands the application for these techniques...|$|E
40|$|The brief was as follows: 1. {{identify}} and critically assess the impacts (during construction and use) of new roads {{on the natural}} environment, habitats and species in protected areas; 2. identify ways of mitigating impacts (such as by way of <b>ecological</b> <b>buffer</b> zones) with reference to specific case studies in New Zealand and in other similar biogeographical regions; 3. identify future research agendas relevant to the topic. The research {{is a first step}} in which information on the topic is assembled. The methods included searches of journals, library databases, advertisements in journals and on the Worldwide Web and through the generosity of many colleagues. A few literature databases relevant to the area of research do exist; the largest being that compiled by Wildlands Centre for Preventing Roads (CPR) in the USA. There are also a few literature reviews on the ecological effects of roads (to ensure an independent approach was taken, these were not consulted until this report was completed). There are many reports on the physical and chemical effects of roads, associated structures and road traffic. These include soil erosion, alteration to surface water hydrology and pollutants in water run-off. There is a large number of reports on the presence of pollutants in biota inhabiting roadside verges. Most of the literature simply reported surveys in which levels of heavy metals and other pollutants are recorded. Very few reports discuss the effects of pollutants; no generalisation can be made because the effects of biota vary from group to group. Some reports indicate that plants on roadside verges become more susceptible to disease and attacks by pests. There is a need for long-term monitoring studies and research which looks at the fate of pollutants in ecosystems. The ecological effects of roads include physical disturbance, habitat loss, extinction of populations and species near the road edge, mortality of wildlife on roads, use of road edges has habitats, dispersal of wildlife (including invasive species and alien species) along road networks. The most important and serious impact of roads on nature is through habitat fragmentation; that is, not only loss of habitats but fragmentation of previously contiguous habitats and subsequent isolation of habitat fragments. Habitat fragmentation is {{considered by many to be}} the greatest and most serious threat to nature. Fragmentation of habitats has implications for loss of biological diversity at species, population and genetic levels. New roads may take traffic, people and introduced species to what were previously undisturbed areas with subsequent impacts on the ecology of the area. Roads facilitate more roads and there is an incremental and long lasting effect. The detrimental effects of roads on nature by far outweighs any advantages to wildlife; both in the short-term and particularly in the long-term. Attempts to reduce the ecological effects have been addressed in many ways. Pollutants in surface water from roads can be contained. The barrier effects of roads can be reduced with tunnels and nature overpasses. The road edge can be managed for indigenous wildlife. Loss of habitat can be compensated by establishing similar habitats elsewhere (mitigation banking). However, habitat fragmentation has not and can not been addressed fully; road routes can be changed to reduce fragmentation but the only real answer is not to build the road. There are several areas in need of further research. The long term effects of pollution on roadside wildlife have not been investigated in depth. The effectiveness of tunnels and other routes for wildlife seems not well quantified. The effects of roads on dispersal of alien species is an area of particular relevance to New Zealand. The methodology and methods for assessment of likely ecological impacts requires much more research and development...|$|E
