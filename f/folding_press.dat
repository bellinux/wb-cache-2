50|$|The {{improved}} version {{replaces the}} fork with a prepared metal wire, typically {{cut from a}} wire coat hanger. The wire is prepared by bending the very end to 90 degrees, forming a long L-shape. A handkerchief with a hem around the outside edge is also needed. A small hole is cut {{into the corner of}} the handkerchief and the wire inserted into the hem, straight end first. When the wire is fully inserted, some fishing about is needed to get the bent end to turn the corner so it is trapped {{in the corner of the}} hem. The trick then proceeds as normal, but repeatedly folds the handkerchief so the bent tip ends up in a known location, often an edge or corner of the <b>folds.</b> <b>Pressing</b> on the bent corner causes the opposite end to rise up.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{evidence of}} sampling or statistical bias in newspaper reporting on campaign finance. We compile all {{stories from the}} five largest circulation newspapers in the United States that mention a dollar amount for campaign expenditures, contributions, or receipts from 1996 to 2000.

The average figures reported in newspapers exceed the analogous figures from the FEC {{by as much as}} eight <b>fold.</b> <b>Press</b> reports also focus excessively on corporate contributions and soft money, rather than on the more common types of donors – individual – and types of contributions – hard money. We further find that these biases are reflected in public perceptions of money in elections. Survey respondents overstate the amount of money raised and the share from different groups by roughly the amount found in newspapers, and better educated people (those most likely to read newspapers) showed the greatest discrepancy between their beliefs and the fact...|$|R

60|$|A leaf {{in being}} dragged {{a little way}} into a {{cylindrical}} burrow is necessarily much folded or crumpled. When another leaf is drawn in, this is done exteriorly to the first one, and so on with the succeeding leaves; and finally all become closely <b>folded</b> and <b>pressed</b> together. Sometimes the worm enlarges the mouth of its burrow, or makes a fresh one close by, so as to draw in a still larger number of leaves. They often or generally fill up the interstices between the drawn-in leaves with moist viscid earth ejected from their bodies; and thus the mouths of the burrows are securely plugged. Hundreds of such plugged burrows {{may be seen in}} many places, especially during the autumnal and early winter months. But, as will hereafter be shown, leaves are dragged into the burrows not only for plugging them up and for food, but for the sake of lining the upper part or mouth.|$|R

In web <b>press’s</b> <b>fold</b> mechanism design, the trace deviation and entrance angle in working state are important criterions which affect the folding knife’s kinematic performance. In order to improve the synthetic kinematics performance, a multiple objective robust optimum design model could be established, based on the analysis of sensitive response to the design variables and determining proper evaluation strategies. By comparing the results of multiple objective robust optimum design and common optimum design, we can find that the synthetic kinematics performance of multiple objective robust optimum design is much better...|$|R
