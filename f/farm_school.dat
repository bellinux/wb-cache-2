In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley <b>Farm</b> <b>School</b> until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Hardwicke Rawnsley was {{appointed}} vicar of Crosthwaite. In {{a study of}} Lake District towns in 1974, H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would {{be the equivalent of}} writing about Stratford-upon-Avon without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley's impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art, which trained local craftsmen and -women from 1894 until it closed in 1986. He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County <b>Farm</b> <b>School.</b> As co-founder of the National Trust, Rawnsley contributed to Keswick's continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.|$|E

Prince Albert laid the first stone in 1853; the hospital was for 40 years home to two of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's cousins Katherine Bowes-Lyon and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon, both of whom had learning difficulties. Another inmate James Henry Pullen (1835–1916) was an autistic savant. He was a brilliant craftsman and artist whose work was accepted by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Some of Pullen's ship models, designs and art work {{used to be on}} display at the town's Belfry Shopping Centre but have now been moved to the Langdon Down Museum in Teddington.

25|$|In 1918 Le Couteur was {{appointed}} headmaster of Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne. The position proved difficult, as {{control of the}} school was shared with the foundation president, who was a bulwark against reform. For ten years Le Couteur served on various university committees and school councils and captained the Hawthorn-East Melbourne Cricket Club. Unsuccessful in applications for the headship of Sydney Grammar School in 1921 and the mastership of Queen's in 1927, he became headmaster of Hale School in 1929. In 1931 he {{was appointed}} headmaster of Newington College succeeding the Rev Dr Charles Prescott. Le Couteur's term at Newington covered the difficult Depression and war years, yet saw a remarkable increase in pupils {{and the opening of}} a preparatory school, Wyvern House, in 1938. With his wife Le Couteur developed the school's musical life. On retirement in 1948 he maintained an interest in the Fairbridge <b>Farm</b> <b>School</b> movement.

25|$|As toddler, Albert {{attended}} an English Catholic pre-primary school, where he heard and learnt his first English. This move seemed baffling to some, as the Calvinist and Boer patriot general Hertzog was a staunch proponent of Afrikaans language rights, especially in education. In 1910, {{after the birth}} of the Union of South Africa, general Hertzog was appointed in a dual portfolio as Minister of Justice and Minister of Native Affairs. The family therefore moved to Pretoria, and occupied a house west of the Union Buildings. His father sent him to the Arcadia Skool, but Albert was disappointed that the school had a headmistress, and, though in the city, differed nothing from a <b>farm</b> <b>school.</b> Although only eleven years old, Albert left on the afternoon of his first day, and enrolled at Pretoria Boys High School. After the schism between general Hertzog and Prime Minister Louis Botha, which led to Hertzog's dismissal from the cabinet, the family moved back to Bloemfontein, where Albert attended Grey College. He matriculated with a First Class in 1916, with the subjects Dutch, English, Latin, Mathematics, and Physical Science.|$|E

Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry-at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts. He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform, partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol.

40|$|<b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> is {{a phrase}} used to {{describe}} programs that connect locally-grown foods to <b>schools</b> (<b>Farm</b> to <b>School,</b> 2009). The medium that provides this connection varies, but it is typically made through <b>school</b> gardens, <b>farm</b> field trips, nutrition and culinary education, or serving local foods in the <b>school</b> meals program. <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> programs are implemented {{to provide students with}} a hands-on learning environment and experiential education, to increase the nutritional quality of food served to students and the amount of time students spend outdoors, and to teach students about the agricultural heritage of their region, among other features. Four approaches are typically utilized in North Carolina and other states to institute <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> program: (1) The North Carolina <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> Program; (2) Local purchasing through contracted produce vendors; (3) Individual school initiatives; (4) District-wide initiatives. The method that a school or school district uses to implement a <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> program depends heavily on stakeholder commitment, funding opportunities, and the support of the school community and the district’s Child Nutrition Services. In this project I have evaluated these four approaches to <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> programs, using examples in three North Carolina counties: Durham, Guilford and Wake, and one North Carolina City: Asheville. As a corollary case study, I documented my experiences working with stakeholders from E. K. Powe Elementary School in Durham, North Carolina as they worked to implement a <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> program during the 2009 - 2010 school year. In short, I evaluate <b>Farm</b> to <b>School</b> programs state-wide and determine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of each program.
