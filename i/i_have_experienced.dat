25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Today <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> my hardest combat. But at {{the same}} time it has been my most {{wonderful}} experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

[...] Conway reported that 2011 was [...] "the toughest year <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> economically, at [...] Wiggles or anywhere".

2500|$|Though Chamberlain {{was always}} very {{supportive}} of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:The Armenian insurrection [...] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a [...] "diversion". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking {{as if it were}} umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened…No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all sides. During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction. At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other {{at a time when he}} believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged [...] "Yellow Peril". In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and has it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners. Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: [...] "This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> which is comparable to it".|$|E
