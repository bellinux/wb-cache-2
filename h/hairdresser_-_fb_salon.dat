40|$|International audienceThe {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to estimate fumonisins (FB 1 and FB 2), moniliformin (MON) and ergosterol (ERG) formation by Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium proliferatum while beauvericin (BEA) by the letter one only. Moreover, the effect of temperature on mycotoxins biosynthesis was also evaluated. Fumonisins were formed by F. proliferatum with the highest yield at 18 °C (720. 0 - 1976. 6 g g- 1 <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> 1, 74. 2 - 670. 8 g g- 1 <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> 2) and only by three of four F. oxysporum strains at a very low level (0. 02 - 4. 77 g g- 1 <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> 1, 0. 02 - 2. 15 g g- 1 <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> 2). The amount of MON formed by F. proliferatum was the highest (p 0. 001) at 32 °C (3056. 87 g g- 1), while MON biosynthesis by F. oxysporum was lower 227. 54 g g- 1 (p 0. 001). BEA was produced by F. proliferatum with the highest level at 25 °C (p 0. 001). ERG - recognized as an indicator of fungal biomass development and as a consequence of mycotoxin formation - was found at the highest concentration at biosynthesis temperature 25 °C for F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum (p 0. 001) ...|$|R

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Medicina Dentária, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina Dentária, 2016 Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and the resin-dentin interface morphology of an universal adhesive system, Futurabond M+ (FB), in the etch-and-rinse strategy {{and in the}} self-etch strategy, with and without pulpal pressure. Methods: Forty caries-free extracted human molars {{were randomly assigned to}} four experimental conditions: Group A <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> with etch-and-rinse strategy; Group B <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> with self-etch strategy, both without pulpal pressure; Group C <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> with etch-and-rinse strategy; Group D <b>-</b> <b>FB</b> with self-etch strategy, both with pulpal pressure. The specimens were then stored in distilled water in an incubator for 24 hours at 37 ºC. Subsequently, teeth were longitudinally sectioned with a low-speed diamond saw under water irrigation, dividing them into two halves. One of the halves was then longitudinally sectioned in both “x” and “y” directions across the bonded interface, creating sticks with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1 mm 2. The other half was sectioned in order to create 2 quarters of the initial specimen and used for SEM observation. Statistical analysis was performed through the SPSS program. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were performed when the assumption of normality and homogeneity were not observed. Results: There were statistically significant differences in μTBS (p< 0, 05) between the ER and SE application modes in the group with pulpal pressure and also when the experimental groups with pulpal pressure were compared with the ones without pulpal pressure. The presence of pulpal pressure also caused structural defects in the resin-dentin interface morphology both in the ER and SE strategies. Conclusions: Pulpal pressure clearly leads to significant differences both in the microtensile bond strength analysis and in the resin-dentin interface morphological analysis of universal adhesives. Hence, it becomes increasingly more important that researchers simulate pulpal pressure in their in vitro studies in order to better represent clinical conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{search for}} diphoton events with large missing {{transverse}} momentum has been performed using 1. 07 <b>fb</b> <b>-</b> 1 of proton-proton collision data at s= 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. No excess of events was observed above the Standard Model prediction and 95 % Confidence Level (CL) upper limits are {{set on the}} production cross section for new physics. The limits depend on each model parameter space and vary as follows: Λ < (22 <b>-</b> 129) <b>fb</b> {{in the context of}} a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GGM) with a bino-like lightest neutralino, σ < (27 <b>-</b> 91) <b>fb</b> {{in the context of a}} minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (SPS 8), and σ < (15 <b>-</b> 27) <b>fb</b> in the context of a specific model with one universal extra dimension (UED). A 95 % CL lower limit of 805 GeV, for bino masses above 50 GeV, is set on the GGM gluino mass. Lower limits of 145 TeV and 1. 23 TeV are set on the SPS 8 breaking scale Λ and on the UED compactification scale 1 /R, respectively. These limits provide the most stringent tests of these models to date. © 2012 CERN...|$|R
