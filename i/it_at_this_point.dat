25|$|Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, {{the rear}} of the column—believing the day's march to be nearly at an end—was dawdling. This {{resulted}} in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.|$|E

The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E

2500|$|Einstein {{considers}} a box (called Einstein's box; see figure) containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls {{the opening of}} a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box. The shutter uncovers the hole for a time [...] which can be chosen arbitrarily. During the opening, we are to suppose that a photon, from among those inside the box, escapes through the hole. In this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created, following the explanation given above. In order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy, it is necessary {{to find a way to}} determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Einstein turns to his celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity: [...] From this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy. The argument is therefore very simple: if one weighs the box before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box, the box will be lighter.

2500|$|By August 1918, the Schutztruppe {{was heading}} north {{to return to}} German East Africa, while the British under Jacob van Deventer had begun to {{concentrate}} their forces {{in the area of}} Regone and Lioma in an attempt to encircle their enemy. [...] Though Lettow-Vorbeck had received intel about the British plans, his forces were once again in dire need of supplies and Regone harbored a large supply depot. As result, the German commander planned a quick assault against the vulnerable village in order to capture as many supplies as possible: Speed was crucial for this plan, as Lettow-Vorbeck would have to outrace the British before they could reinforce Regone or catch up with him. Rough terrain, rain and fog hindered and delayed the Schutztruppe, however, so that when it reached Regone on 26 August, the British had already fortified and reinforced <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> the Germans could only have taken Regone by a prolonged siege for which they had no time, so that Lettow-Vorbeck chose to call off the attack. His forces bypassed Regone and instead began to march to Lioma, another supply depot. Unknown to the Germans, a British battalion (1/1st KAR) already managed to reinforce the village on 28 August, while two other battalions also force-marched toward Lioma. Between the British forces at Regone and the units that gathered at Lioma the Schutztruppe would be trapped, and if everything went according to van Deventer's plans, destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{years of}} 1953-54 {{provided}} a contrasting picture: the Carlist leaders boasted {{of having a}} new king, while Don Javier withdrew to Lignières, reducing his political activity to receiving guests and to correspondence. In private he played down what had already became known as [...] "Acto de Barcelona", dubbing it [...] "un toutté petite ceremonie". Carlist dissenters, temporarily silenced, started to be heard again. Don Javier seemed increasingly tired of his role and leaning towards a dynastical understanding with Don Juan. His brief early 1955 visit to Spain en route to Portugal fuelled angry rumors of forthcoming rapprochement with the Alfonsists as Don Javier made some ambiguous comments, named the 1952 statement [...] "a grave error" [...] and declared having been bullied into <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> relations between him and Fal reached the lowest point; Fal, attacked from all sides and feeling no royal support, resigned. According to some scholars, Don Javier sacked him in [...] "a rather cowardly, backhand manner". Fal was soon replaced by a collegial executive. In late 1955 Don Javier issued a manifesto which declared the Carlists [...] "custodians of patrimony" [...] rather than political party seeking power and in private considered his royal claim a hindrance to alliance of all reasonable people. The year of 1956 proved convulsing, {{with a number of}} contradictory declarations following one another in circles; one episode cost Don Javier another expulsion from Spain.|$|E
