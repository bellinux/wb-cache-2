25|$|Off {{the success}} of BLIC2005, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 was developed. Using the same release date tactics as the {{previous}} game, it was shipped during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The game was available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 consoles, {{as well as for}} Windows. This version includes many graphical as well as gameplay improvements. The Xbox 360 version is the first console port in the series to be in high definition widescreen. Gameplay improvements include analogue <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> when batting, this allows the player to attempt to hit the ball in any direction. In India, it was released as 'Yuvraj Singh International Cricket 2007'. It was also the second game in the Ricky Ponting international series.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{concluded that}} the probable cause of the accident was a navigational error which must have taken place before the aircraft had descended to 1,100meters (3,500ft). No technical faults were found with the aircraft. The report stated {{that there were some}} shortcomings in crew procedures: a measurement for <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> had been moved to a less visible location, a radio compass was set at the wrong frequency so it received bearings from Lahti, a conversation related to the holidays with air traffic control and that the captain was not as rested as he could have been according to regulations. The commission could not find that the weather or the wind was a contributing cause, although the darkness and fog could have hindered the crew from gaining a visual cue to their location.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of the present {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between controlling styles and time perspective in a sample of Iranian students. Controlling styles defined as the ethologic attribution of personal behavior in 4 styles (other direction, inner direction, lack of constraints on behavior and predictability of behavior). Time perspective refers {{to the ways in which}} an individual views his/her past, present and future. This construct is an unconscious cognitive structure that a person implements in the time of decision making about short term or long term goals and actions and includes past (positive or negative), present (hedonistic or fatalistic), and future time perspective. A total of 266 students (63 boys, 203 girls) were participated in this study as volunteers. They were asked to complete Personal Behaviour Inventory and Zimbardo Time perspective Inventory (ZTPI- 15; in press, 2011). Results showed significant positive correlation between inner <b>direction</b> <b>controlling</b> style and present hedonistic, and significant correlation of lack of constraints on behaviour with positive hedonistic. The results also revealed significant positive correlation of inner <b>direction</b> <b>controlling</b> style with future time perspective, and past positive, and significant positive correlation of other <b>direction</b> <b>controlling</b> style with present fatalistic time perspective. Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that individuals with inner <b>direction</b> <b>controlling</b> style have a higher levels of time dimensions and time perspective...|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent salvoes {{from the}} raider were more accurate. The second, three-shell salvo {{destroyed}} Sydneys bridge and damaged her upper superstructure, including the gun <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> tower, wireless offices, and foremast. The fourth [...] gun was ready by this time, and all four began to fire: {{the third and}} fourth salvoes knocked the cruiser's [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] turrets out of action before they could fire a second time, and the fifth hit Sydney on the waterline in proximity to the forward engine room, although one shell hit high and destroyed the Walrus. Kormorans guns were aimed at Sydneys waterline and upper deck during the next three salvoes. After the sixth German salvo, Sydney resumed fire with her aft turrets: [...] "Y" [...] turret fired less than four times with little effect, but multiple shots from [...] "X" [...] turret struck Kormoran, damaging the raider's machinery spaces, wounding the sailors manning one of the guns, and starting a fire in an oil tank.|$|E
60|$|In his stiff-necked pride, Mr. Burroughs runs {{a hazard}} more humiliating to that pride than {{any amount of}} kinship with the other animals. When a dog {{exhibits}} choice, <b>direction,</b> <b>control,</b> and reason; when it is shown that certain mental processes in that dog's brain are precisely duplicated in the brain of man; and when Mr. Burroughs convincingly proves that every action of the dog is mechanical and automatic--then, by precisely the same arguments, can it be proved that the similar actions of man are mechanical and automatic. No, Mr. Burroughs, though you stand {{on the top of}} the ladder of life, you must not kick out that ladder from under your feet. You must not deny your relatives, the other animals. Their history is your history, and if you kick them to the bottom of the abyss, to the bottom of the abyss you go yourself. By them you stand or fall. What you repudiate in them you repudiate in yourself--a pretty spectacle, truly, of an exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made, striving by use of the very reason that was developed by evolution to deny the possession of evolution that developed it. This may be good egotism, but it is not good science.|$|E
