5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Crash Team Racing is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Crash Bandicoot series. The game's story focuses on the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ragtag team of characters in the Crash Bandicoot series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save their planet from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen Crash Bandicoot series characters, though only eight are available at first.

50|$|The logical <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-input NAND gate is {{calculated}} to be g = 4/3 because a NAND gate with input capacitance 4 can drive the same current as the inverter can, with input capacitance 3. Similarly, the logical <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-input NOR gate {{can be found}} to be g = 5/3. Due to the lower logical effort, NAND gates are typically preferred to NOR gates.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French Ministry of Agriculture, due to the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small number of breed enthusiasts, though by that time only 50 purebred mares remained. The breed association's name was changed to L’association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP) (National Association of Castillonnais Horses of the Ariège Pyrenees), and is headquartered in Castillon-en-Couserans. Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that has worked to protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} pumped {{out through the}} joint <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local fire company and the shipyard, and Prince of Wales was later dry docked for {{permanent}} repairs. This damage and {{the problem with the}} delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her bilge, ballast and fuel-oil systems.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 and 1991, during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the 18th Engineer Brigade {{provided}} {{rail and}} sea deployment {{support to the}} VII Corps and, in addition, deployed a Combat Heavy Battalion and Topographic Company to support VII Corps operations in Southwest Asia. In April 1991, the Brigade Headquarters, along with elements of the 94th Engineer Battalion (Combat) (Heavy), deployed to Zakho, Iraq in support of Operation Provide Comfort. While there, the Brigade coordinated all engineer <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Joint and Combined engineer force providing construction and relief support to the Kurdish refugees. The 18th Engineer Brigade was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for its action during Operation Provide Comfort. As part of the reduction of forces in Europe, the Brigade was inactivated on 15 October 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Calakmul still existed as a state in any meaningful way at this late date. A final flurry of activity took place {{at the end of the}} 9th century or the beginning of the 10th. A new stela was erected, although the date records only the day, not the full date. The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition. Even the inscriptions on these late monuments are meaningless imitations of writing.|$|E
5|$|On Hill 217 the Fusiliers had {{maintained}} {{the pressure on}} the Chinese throughout the day, however they were still unable to capture the feature. Regardless, the efforts of the Fusiliers in conjunction with A Company's diversionary attack and the rapid advance of D Company with tank and artillery support had carried the day. A Company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire, slowly pushing the Chinese defenders back. Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire. Indeed, although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 Chinese and capturing two. Now with Maryang San captured the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear Chinese trench system into an all-round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits. Fully expecting a Chinese counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the hasty defences. Meanwhile, the Chinese still occupied three key ridgeline positions—the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself—which they continued to furiously defend. These would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Knowledge {{acquisition}} {{is when we}} ask experts questions, and put {{the answers}} into a computer system. Since {{this is a very}} time-consuming task, it is desirable to minimize the <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expert. As a crude estimate for this effort, we can take <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> binary (yes-no) questions that we ask. The procedure that minimizes this number is binary search. This approach {{does not take into account}} that people often feel more comfortable answering “yes ” than answering “no”. So, to make our estimates more realistic, we will take into consideration that for a negative answer the effort is bigger. This paper describes a procedure that minimizes the <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expert. We also estimate the <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> this “optimal ” search procedure...|$|R
