2500|$|Axelrod {{was born}} on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, {{and grew up in}} its Stuyvesant Town area. He was raised in a liberal Jewish family. His mother, Myril Bennett (née Davidson), was a {{journalist}} at PM, a liberal-leaning 1940s newspaper, and later an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam. [...] His father, Joseph Axelrod, was a psychologist and avid baseball fan, who migrated from Eastern Europe to the United States at the age of eleven. He attended Public School 40 in Manhattan. Axelrod's parents separated when he was eight years old. Axelrod traces his political involvement back to his childhood. Describing the appeal of politics, he told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I got into politics because I believe in idealism. Just {{to be a part of}} this effort that seems to be rekindling the kind of idealism that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> I was a kid, it's a great thing to do. So I find myself getting very emotional about it." [...] At thirteen years old, he was selling campaign buttons for Robert F. Kennedy. After graduating from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1972, Axelrod attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in Political Science.|$|E
