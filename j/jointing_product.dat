40|$|According to the {{standard}} version ofthe labour theory of value, labourvalue of a product {{is defined as the}} social average of the amounts of labour embodied in the homogeneous products on the supposition that the scale of the production is appropriate to the social demand for the products. In case of <b>joint</b> <b>products,</b> the amount of labour directly and indirectly necessary for their production needs to be divided among individual <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> before calculating the average. In the labour division, the composition of demands for heterogeneous <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> must be considered because it will be different from the composition of the products which is fundamentally determined by the technical relations of production. The labour division among <b>joint</b> <b>products,</b> therefore; is understandable through two logical phases. First, without any consideration for the gap between demand and production peculiar to <b>joint</b> <b>products,</b> the amount of labour necessary for production is divided equally among categories of homogeneous <b>joint</b> <b>products.</b> Second, the division of necessary labour is modified by the consideration for the gap. The labour divided into unsold products is divided again among other <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> sold in higher proportions to production because the former are the useless by-products of the latter. The amount of labour commanded by each <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> may be further deviated from the average of its embodied labour after the modification. Labour-values of <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> should include the part of deviations which reflects the reduction of the gap at the markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to Christian Gehrke's comment, {{and argues that}} the main conclusion of my earlier paper is sustained—that, contrary to Sraffa, Marx did not 'adopt' in any {{sense of the word}} the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method of treating fixed capital. It agrees with Gehrke that Torrens adopted a form of the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method, and that Malthus seems to have followed Torrens in this regard. However, it argues that Ricardo did not adopt the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method, not even in the one instance cited by Sraffa. Finally, it argues briefly that Marx's 'transformation of value' method of treating fixed capital and depreciation is superior to Sraffa's <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method. ...|$|R

Pricing for <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> {{is more complex than}} pricing for a single product. To begin with, there are two demand curves. The characteristics of each could be different. Demand for one product could be greater than for the other. Consumers of one product could be more price elastic than consumers of the other (and therefore more sensitive to changes in the product's price).|$|R

60|$|Their {{leaders will}} largely deny this last statement, but an {{examination}} of their utterances, their actions, and the situation will forestall such denial. In the first place, the conflict between labor and capital is over {{the division of the}} join product. Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material and make it into a finished product. The difference between the value of the raw material and the value of the finished product is the value they have added to it by their joint effort. This added value is, therefore, their <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> and it is over the division of this <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> that the struggle between labor and capital takes place. Labor takes its share in wages; capital takes its share in profits. It is patent, if capital took in profits the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> that labor would perish. And it is equally patent, if labor took in wages the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> that capital would perish. Yet this last is the very thing labor aspires to do, and that it will never be content with anything less than the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> is evidenced by the words of its leaders.|$|R

The approach is applied to evaluate the anticipated effects of a potential program of individual transferable quotas addressing the ill-structured property rights and market failure of a multiproduct common property fishery. The results indicate that individual transferable quotas on multiple products may not generate the desired rents or achieve biological objectives, owing to limitations when <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> are regulated. However, an individual transferable quota on a single <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> may induce industry disinvestment and reduce overcapitalization. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{conceptual and}} empirical frameworks {{for assessing the}} economic benefits from agricultural research which enhances the amount of a desirable characteristic in each unit of a heterogeneous commodity. The commodity is assumed to comprise two or more <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> accruable in fixed proportion. Quality improvement is perceived as {{an increase in the}} proportion of a <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> with more of a more-valued characteristic and, as such, is modelled as a shift in the supply curve of a <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> rather than via a shift in commodity demand. A proxy variable is constructed to measure an intertemporal quality change and to estimate the associated size of the supply shift. An application of the framework to the Australian beef industry indicates that the per unit amount of the characteristic 'freshness' in beef has increased over the last two decades. Substantial social benefits can be obtained by research which enhances the quality of Australian beef carcasses. A larger share of the total benefits accrue to beef producers.

40|$|The Introductory Note {{provides}} {{a definition of}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Products,</b> i. e. those goods that cannot be produced separately from each other -such as wool and mutton, iron and coke, and so on. It discusses the secondary role they played in economic theory, {{and the need to}} reconsider their role in the analysis of processes of production with fixed capital. Reference is made to Sraffa, who stated: “The interest of <b>Joint</b> <b>Products</b> does not lie so much in the familiar examples of wool and mutton, or wheat and straw, as in its being the genus of which Fixed Capital is the leading species. And it is mainly as an introduction to the subject of fixed capital that the [...] . chapters devoted to the intricacies of <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> find their place. " The essays collected in “Essays on the Theory of Joint Production”, started from a series of discussions, over several years, that the author encouraged at the Economics Institute of the Università Cattolica of Milan and at the University of Cambridge. They aim to make a contribution toward an in-depth analysis of a general scheme, with a specificity, provided, of course, that the specificity concerns cases which although particular, are relevant. This seems to be precisely the case of fixed capital and non-reproducible means of production...|$|R
