40|$|Double-strand breaks (DSBs) greatly enhance gene {{conversion}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In prior plasmid x chromosome crosses, conversion tracts were often short (< 53 bp) and usually extended {{in only one}} direction from a DSB in an HO recognition sequence inserted into ura 3. To allow fine-structure analysis of short and unidirectional tracts, phenotypically silent markers were introduced at 3 - and 6 -bp intervals flanking the HO site. These markers, which created a 70 -bp homeologous region (71 % homology), greatly increased the proportion of bidirectional tracts. Among products with short or unidirectional tracts, 85 % were highly directional, converting markers on only one side (the nearest marker being 6 bp from the HO site). A DSB in an HO site insertion creates terminal nonhomologies. The high degree of directionality is a likely consequence of the precise cleavage at homology/nonhomology borders in hybrid DNA by Rad 1 / 10 endonuclease. In contrast, terminal <b>homeology</b> alone yielded mostly unidirectional tracts. Thus, nonhomology flanked by <b>homeology</b> yields primarily bidirectional tracts, but terminal <b>homeology</b> or nonhomology alone yields primarily unidirectional tracts. These results are inconsistent with uni- and bidirectional tracts arising from one- and two-ended invasion mechanisms, respectively, as reduced homology {{would be expected to}} favor one-ended events. Tract spectra with terminal <b>homeology</b> alone with similar in RAD 1 and rad 1 cells, indicating that the high proportion of bidirectional tracts seen with <b>homeology</b> flanking nonhomology is not a consequence of Rad 1 / 10 cleavage at homology/homeology boundaries. Instead, tract directionality appears to reflect the influence of the degree of broken-end homology on mismatch repair...|$|E

We used chromosome landmarks identified by these markers to construct the first Arachis species ideogram in which all the homologous chromosomes were precisely identified. The comparison of this ideogram with those published for other Arachis species revealed very poor <b>homeologies</b> with all A and B genome taxa, supporting the special genome constitution (D genome) of A. glandulifera.

Aiming to estimate the cytological variation among Tripogandra species carrying this base number, several structural karyotypic characters were investigated in the diploid T. glandulosa, the hexaploid T. serrulata, and the octoploid T. diuretica. A careful evaluation of chromosome size and morphology did not reveal clear chromosome <b>homeologies</b> among karyotypes. The mean chromosome size was strongly reduced in the octoploid species, {{but not in the}} hexaploid species. They also differed largely in the CMA+ banding pattern and in the number of 5 S and 45 S rDNA sites per monoploid chromosome complement. All three species showed proximal DAPI + heterochromatin, although in T. serrulata this kind of heterochromatin was only visible after FISH. Further, the meiosis in T. serrulata was highly irregular, suggesting that this species has a hybrid origin. The data indicate that, in spite of the conservation of the base number, these species are karyologically quite different from each other...|$|R
40|$|How do {{chromosomal}} {{regions with}} differing degrees of homology and <b>homeology</b> interact at meiosis? We provide a novel analytical method based on simple genetics principles {{which can help}} to answer this important question. This method interrogates high-throughput molecular marker data in order to infer chromosome behavior at meiosis in interspecific hybrids. We validated this method using high-resolution molecular marker karyotyping in two experimental Brassica populations derived from interspecific crosses among B. juncea, B. napus and B. carinata, using a single nucleotide polymorphism chip. This method of analysis successfully identified meiotic interactions between chromosomes sharing different degrees of similarity: full-length homologs; full-length homeologs; large sections of primary homeologs; and small sections of secondary homeologs. This analytical method {{can be applied to}} any allopolyploid species or fertile interspecific hybrid in order to detect meiotic associations. This genetic information can then be used to identify which genomic regions share functional <b>homeology</b> (i. e., retain enough similarity to allow pairing and segregation at meiosis). When applied to interspecific hybrids for which reference genome sequences are available, the question of how differing degrees of homology and <b>homeology</b> affect meiotic interactions may finally be resolved...|$|E

These species {{are characterized by}} their high degree of karyotypic evolution, diverging from most other species of the subfamily Stenodermatinae, which have a lower degree of chromosomic evolution. The present study reports the first banding patterns of U. magnirostrum (G-, C-banding and Ag-NOR) and U. bilobatum (C-banding and Ag-NOR). The chromosomic data in conventional staining of U. magnirostrum (2 n = 36, NF = 62) and U. bilobatum (cytotype 2 n = 42, NF = 50) are equivalent to that described in the literature. When compared, chromosomal <b>homeologies</b> are found in both karyotypes, as well as differences, confirming that karyotypic evolution in the Uroderma genus is intense. Fission, fusion, inversion or translocation events are required to explain the karyotypic evolution of this genus. The comparison of karyotype, described here, {{to one of the}} species of the genus Artibeus (2 n = 30 / 31), suggests that some chromosomic forms are apomorphic and shared between the two species of Uroderma. This confirms the monophyly of the enus, and that U. magnirostrum presents a more primitive karyotype when compared to U. bilobatu...|$|R

Recent studies have indicated the occurrence of five recognized species in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. We present here the first cytogenetic data of a Brazilian salamander, which may prove to be a useful by contribution to the cytotaxonomy of the genus. Specimens were collected near the "type" locality (Utinga, Belém, PA, Brazil). Chromosomal preparations from duodenal epithelial cells and testes were subjected to Giemsa staining, C-banding and DAPI/CMA 3 fluorochrome staining. All specimens showed a karyotype with 13 bi-armed chromosome pairs (2 n = 26). Nucleolar Organizer Regions, evidenced by CMA 3, were located distally on the long arm of pair 7 (7 q). DAPI+ heterochromatin was predominantly centromeric, with some small pericentromeric bands. Although the C-banding patterns of other Bolitoglossa species are so far unknown, cytogenetic studies conducted in other Plethodontid salamanders have demonstrated that pericentromeric heterochromatin is a useful cytological marker for identifying interspecific <b>homeologies.</b> Species diversification is usually accompanied by chromosomal changes. Therefore, the cytogenetic characterization of Bolitoglossa populations from the middle and western Brazilian Amazon Basin could identify differences which may lead to the identification of new species...|$|R

Seeing that cytogenetics {{is one of the}} fields capable of providing support for currently adopted classifications through the use of several markers, a comparative analysis between two Phyllostomidae species was undertaken in the present study, with a view to supplying datasets for the further establishment of Phyllostomidae evolutionary relationships. Karyotypes of Lonchorhina aurita (2 n = 32; FN = 60) and Trachops cirrhosus (2 n = 30; FN = 56) were analyzed by G- and C-banding, silver nitrate staining (Ag-NOR) and base-specific fluorochromes. Chromosomal data obtained for both species are in agreement with those previously described, except for X chromosome morphology in T. cirrhosus, hence indicating chromosomal geographical variation in this species. A comparison of G-banding permitted the identification of <b>homeologies</b> in nearly all the chromosomes. Furthermore, C-banding and Ag-NOR patterns were comparable to what has already been observed in the family. In both species CMA /DA/DAPI staining revealed an R-banding-like pattern with CMA, 3 3 whereas DAPI showed uniform staining in all the chromosomes.

FISH analysis using the chromosome painting probes for the # 3 and # 15 human chromosomes was applied to corroborate the <b>homeology</b> of the sexual systems. We found that the HSA 3 / 15 syntenic association, present in the sex chromosome systems of South American Howlers, is not present in those of Mesoamerican ones. The autosomes involved in the translocation that formed the sexual systems in the Mesoamerican and South American species are different, thus suggesting an independent origin.

This genus {{presents}} high karyotypic diversity (2 n = 54 to 2 n = 86) and many taxonomic issues at the species level {{because of the presence}} of cryptic species and the overlap of morphological characters. For these reasons the real number of species of Oecomys may be underestimated. With the aim of verifying if the taxon Oecomys catherinae is composed of more than one species, we made comparative studies on two populations from two regions of Brazil, one from the Amazon and another from the Atlantic Forest using both classical cytogenetics (G- and C-banding) and comparative genomic mapping with whole chromosome probes of Hylaeamys megacephalus (HME), molecular data (cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA) and morphology. Our results confirm that Oecomys catherinae occurs in the southeast Amazon, and reveal a new karyotype for the species (2 n = 62, FNa = 62). The comparative genomic analysis with HME probes identified chromosomal <b>homeologies</b> between both populations and rearrangements that are responsible for the different karyotypes. We compared our results in Sigmodontinae genera with other studies that also used HME probes. These chromosomal differences together with the absence of consistent differentiation between the two populations on morphological and molecular analyses suggest that these populations may represent cryptic species...|$|R

Results: Two types of 5 S rDNA, which were readily differentiated by their NTS (non-transcribed spacer) sizes and compositions, were isolated from specimens of E. freibergi from Brazil and E. petersi from two Ecuadorian localities (Puyo and Yasuní). In the E. freibergi karyotypes, the entire type I 5 S rDNA repeating unit hybridized to the pericentromeric region of 3 p, whereas the entire type II 5 S rDNA repeating unit mapped to the distal region of 6 q, suggesting a differential localization of these sequences. The type I NTS probe clearly detected the 3 p pericentromeric region in the karyotypes of E. freibergi and E. petersi from Puyo and the 5 p pericentromeric region in the karyotype of E. petersi from Yasuní, but no distal or interstitial signals were observed.

While for man and many domisticated mammals, an International Siystem for Chromosome Nomenclature is available, {{it has yet to}} be estabilished for fishes because reproducible euchromatic G- and fluorochrome-banding patterns are difficult to obtain. The European el Anguilla anguilla is commercially important but since 1980 ’s, recruitments and catches have declined dramatically. Reports of A. anguilla karyotype using different banding techniques are numerous, but since chromosome classification criteria vary with authors, data comparison is difficult. Since the 1990 ’s, we have analyzed the kariotype of Atlantic ells A. anguilla european and A. rostrata (American). Here, we present the GBG-banded ideograms of A. anguilla chromosomes. Applying the Cromowin karyotyping system (Amplimedical S. p.

Our goal is to estabilish an eel standard karyotype, which agrees with all A. anguilla karyotes previously reported. Moreover, this A. anguilla standard karyotype will serve as a landmark for studies on other eel species.

Wild relatives of wheat are rich repositories of beneficial genes that {{are capable of}} defy-ing adverse situations. However, these wild species are not readily crossable with cultivated ones. The present study attempted to cross three wild wheat species as females with three cultivated species of varying ploidy to understand the intricate behaviour of hybrids in relation to cytology, morphology, and molecular recombination. Post-fertilization barriers caused hybrid recovery in wild species in contrast to cultivated species. Triticum monococcum did not produce hybrids in any of the crosses. Various degrees of chromosome anomalies and hybrid sterility were seen with hybrids of T. timopheevi and T. sphaerococcum. Cytoplasmic factors were suspected to add more to the abnormality. G genome from T. timopheevi could enhance more pairing between B and D of culti-vated species. Precocity of certain chromosomes in laggard formation was evident, pointing towards evolutionary self balance of the genomes which prevented homeologous pairing. They are eliminated in hybrids.

The experimental population was evaluated in a replicated trial for borer damage under natural infestation in two successive crop cycles. A singlefactor analysis using 1, 405 polymorphic markers was performed to detect marker-trait associations. Statistical thresholds based on permutation tests designed to control type I errors at a low level allowed the detection of nine QTAs whose individual size ranged between 6 and 10 % of the total variation. These nine QTAs are distributed over five of the eight <b>homeology</b> groups of the polyploid R 570 genome. Two QTAs were found to co-localize with two typical resistance gene analog clusters.

In the present cytogenetic analysis, R-banding and telomere-sequence hybridization {{were carried out}} {{in order to determine}} the possible relationship between the karyotipes of these two species. Incorporation bands (R-bands) obtained for the two species allowed the identification of chromosome similarities, showing to be an usefull alternative to the G-banding methods, which fail in producing satisfying results in most of analyzed fish species. This approach, associated with the hybridization of telomeric sequences, permited to identify chromosomal rearrangements that could be used as indicators of karyotypic evolution within the group. In the present case, telomeric sequences were detected in the centromeric region of two metacentric chromosome pairs of Gymnotus sylvius. The results obtained after hybridization with the telomere sequences, coupled with the chromosome <b>homeologies</b> detected by R-banding, showed that G. cf carapo and G. sylvius should present a common ancestor, and this may also be corroborated by the similarities found in three chromosome pairs, that seem to have been conserved during the evolution of the two species.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{advances}} in the accumulation of genetic mapping and DNA sequence information from several salmonid species support the long standing view of an autopolyploid origin of these fishes (i. e., 4 R). However, the paralogy relationships of the chromosomal segments descendent from earlier polyploidization events (i. e., 2 R/ 3 R) largely remain unknown, mainly due to an unbalanced pseudogenization of paralogous genes that were once resident on the ancient duplicated segments. Inter-specific conserved noncoding elements (CNE) might hold the key in identifying these regions, if they are associated with arrays of genes that have been highly conserved in syntenic blocks through evolution. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the chromosomal positions of subset of CNE in the rainbow trout genome using a comparative genomic framework. Results Through a genome wide analysis, we selected 41 pairs of adjacent CNE located on various chromosomes in zebrafish and obtained their intervening, less conserved, sequence information from rainbow trout. We identified 56 distinct fragments corresponding to about 150 Kbp of sequence data that were localized to 67 different chromosomal regions in the rainbow trout genome. The genomic positions of many duplicated CNE provided additional support for some previously suggested <b>homeologies</b> in this species. Additionally, we now propose 40 new potential paralogous affinities by analyzing the variation in the segregation patterns of some multi-copy CNE along with the synteny association comparison using several model vertebrates. Some of these regions appear to carry signatures of the 1 R, 2 R or 3 R duplications. A subset of these CNE markers also demonstrated high utility in identifying homologous chromosomal segments in the genomes of Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr. Conclusion CNE {{seem to be more}} efficacious than coding sequences in providing insights into the ancient paralogous affinities within the vertebrate genomes. Such a feature makes these elements extremely attractive for comparative genomics studies, as they can be treated as 'anchor' markers to investigate the association of distally located candidate genes on the homologous genomic segments of closely or distantly related organisms. </p...|$|R

In this work we report the {{characterization of the}} Gymnothorax tile karyotype by conventional chromosome bandings and FISH. Gymnothorax tile (Hamilton, 1822) is an Anguilliform fish belonging to family Murenidae, it lives in brakish waters of Pacific and Indian Oceans. The knowledge on this species is very few and refers only its maintenance in captivity: it has a commercial importance as aquarium fish. We analized eleven females by blood cell culture. More than eighthy metaphases plates have been analyzed by Wright’s staining, C- and CMA 3 - bandings, silver staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (F. I. S. H.). The relative length and centromeric index of each chromosome pair has been measured by the Cromowin System software (TESI imaging) and Levan et al. (1964) chromosome morphology classification has been applied. A 42 chromosomes karyotype was determined, chromosomes have been arranged in two group of pairs: the first comprises 17 meta-submetacentric of decreasing length and the second 4 acrocentric pairs; heterochromosomes were not identified. Telomeric C-bands were present on all acrocentrics but one, and peculiar intercalary bands characterized some biarmed pairs. One Ag-NOR was localized on the p-arm of pair 12, this was also the only region positive both to 45 S rDNA F. I. S. H. and to CMA 3 staining. Karyological studies on the Muraenidae family are very sparse and the karyotype is known only in seven species out of 200 (Nelson, 1994) belonging to 15 genera, present in tropical and temperate seas. Most of the species have 2 n= 42 but with a different karyotype structure; heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported in Gymnothorax eurostus. Within the family, Muraena helena and G. unicolor genomes are the most studied both at a cytogenetic and molecular level; recently replication banding techniques have pointed out numerous chromosomal <b>homeologies</b> and the chromosome rearrangements that occurred {{in the evolution of the}} karyotype between these species.

Brassica napus (AACC; 2 n = 38) is a recent allopolyploid species whose progenitor genomes are widely replicated. In this article, we analyze {{the extent to which}} chromosomal rearrangements originate from homeologous recombination during meiosis of haploid B. napus (n = 19) by genotyping progenies of haploid × euploid B. napus with molecular markers. Our study focuses on three pairs of homeologous regions selected for their differing levels of divergence (N 1 /N 11, N 3 /N 13, and N 9 /N 18). We show that a high number of chromosomal rearrangements occur during meiosis of B. napus haploid and are transmitted by first division restitution (FDR) -like unreduced gametes to their progeny; half of the progeny of Darmor-bzh haploids display duplications and/or losses in the chromosomal regions being studied. We demonstrate that half of these rearrangements are due to recombination between regions of primary <b>homeology,</b> which represents a 10 - to 100 -fold increase compared to the frequency of homeologous recombination measured in euploid lines. Some of the other rearrangements certainly result from recombination between paralogous regions because we observed an average of one to two autosyndetic A–A and/or C–C bivalents at metaphase I of the B. napus haploid.

Thirteen QTLs were found, affecting the content of Xyl (two QTLs), Ara (two QTLs), Gal (five QTLs), Glc (two QTLs), Ara + Gal (one QTL), and Xyl + Glc (one QTL).

Orthologous sequences {{of the major}} genes of the mammalian sex determination pathway {{have been reported in}} the rainbow trout but the map position for the majority of these genes has not been assigned. Results Five loci of four candidate genes (Amh, Dax 1, Dmrt 1 and Sox 6) were tested for linkage to the Y chromosome of rainbow trout. We exclude the role of all these loci as candidates for the primary SDG in this species. Sox 6 i and Sox 6 ii, duplicated copies of Sox 6, mapped to homeologous linkage groups 10 and 18 respectively. Genotyping fishes of the OSU × Arlee mapping family for Sox 6 i and Sox 6 ii alleles indicated that Sox 6 i locus might be deleted in the Arlee lineage. Conclusion Additional candidate genes should be tested for their linkage to the Y chromosome. Mapping data of duplicated Sox 6 loci supports previously suggested <b>homeology</b> between linkage groups 10 and 18. Enrichment of the rainbow trout genomic map with known gene markers allows map comparisons with other salmonids. Mapping of candidate sex-determining loci is important for analyses of potential autosomal modifiers of sex-determination in rainbow trout. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., {{is a well}} {{documented}} paleopolyploid. What remains relatively under characterized {{is the level of}} sequence identity in retained homeologous regions of the genome. Recently, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute and United States Department of Agriculture jointly announced the sequencing of the soybean genome. One of the initial concerns is to what extent sequence identity in homeologous regions would have on whole genome shotgun sequence assembly. Results Seventeen BACs representing ~ 2. 03 Mb were sequenced as representative potential homeologous regions from the soybean genome. Genetic mapping of each BAC shows that 11 of the 20 chromosomes are represented. Sequence comparisons between homeologous BACs shows that the soybean genome is a mosaic of retained paleopolyploid regions. Some regions appear to be highly conserved while other regions have diverged significantly. Large-scale "batch" reassembly of all 17 BACs combined showed that even the most homeologous BACs with upwards of 95 % sequence identity resolve into their respective homeologous sequences. Potential assembly errors were generated by tandemly duplicated pentatricopeptide repeat containing genes and long simple sequence repeats. Analysis of a whole-genome shotgun assembly of 80, 000 randomly chosen JGI-DOE sequence traces reveals some new soybean-specific repeat sequences. Conclusion This analysis investigated both the structure of the paleopolyploid soybean genome and the potential effects retained <b>homeology</b> will have on assembling the whole genome shotgun sequence. Based upon these results, homeologous regions similar to those characterized here will not cause major assembly issues. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Using Next Generation Sequencing, SNP {{discovery}} {{is relatively easy}} on diploid species and still hampered in polyploid species by the confusion due to <b>homeology.</b> We develop HomeoSplitter; a fast and effective solution to split original contigs obtained by RNAseq into two homeologous sequences.

We verify that the new sequences are closer to the diploid progenitors of the allopolyploid species than the original contig. By remapping original reads on these new sequences, we also verify {{that the number of}} valuable detected SNPs has significantly increased. Thirty accessions of the tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum, A and B genomes) were sequenced in pooled cDNA libraries. Reads were assembled in a de novo durum assembly.

On a benchmark set of 2, 505 clusters containing homologous sequences of urartu, speltoides and durum, HomeoSplitter was efficient to build sequences closer to the diploid references and increased the number of valuable SNPs from 188 out of 1, 360 SNPs detected when mapping the reads on the de novo durum assembly to 762 out of 1, 620 SNPs when mapping on HomeoSplitter contigs.

40|$|ABSTRACT Grama-tio-pedro (Paspalum oteroi Swallen) {{is a rare}} stoloniferous {{grass of}} the Plicatula group of Paspalum, well adapted to {{continuous}} grazing in areas subject to seasonal flooding in the Pantanal region, in central western Brazil. The species is a facultative apomictic (asexual reproduction by seed) tetraploid, sporadically cultivated on Pantanal farms, propagated either by cuttings or seed. Due to its potential for extensive cultivation and forage quality, Grama-tio-pedro appears {{as a candidate for}} genetic improvement within the Plicatula group through plant breeding. We used a colchicine-induced sexual autotetraploid genotype of P. plicatulum Michx. to obtain interspecific hybrids using the apomictic species, P. oteroi, as pollen donor. The very similar meiotic chromosome behavior observed in both parents, with main quadrivalent and bivalent associations, suggested that P. oteroi is a natural autotetraploid. The hybrids showed less irregular meiotic behavior with fewer quadrivalents and more bivalents than either parent. Fertility among interspecific hybrids varied from complete sterility in some of them to seed productions in others that were approximately twice as much as for either parent. The great variability of seed set performance may well be a drastic genetic consequence of joining two homologous chromosome sets of P. plicatulum together with two homologous sets of P. oteroi that, in turn, have some <b>homeology</b> between them. Most hybrids reproduce by sexual means, thus, they could be used as female parents in backcrosses and in crosses with other species of the Plicatula group for interspecific gene transferring in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that recombination between 400 -bp substrates containing only 4 -bp differences, when present in an inverted repeat orientation, is suppressed by > 20 -fold in wild-type strains of S. cerevisiae. Among the genes {{involved in this}} suppression were three genes involved in mismatch repair—MSH 2, MSH 3, and MSH 6 —and one in nucleotide excision repair, RAD 1. We now report the involvement of these genes in interchromosomal recombination occurring via crossovers using these same short substrates. In these experiments, recombination was stimulated by a double-strand break generated by the HO endonuclease and can occur between completely identical (homologous) substrates or between nonidentical (homeologous) substrates. In addition, a unique feature of this system is that recombining DNA strands can be given a choice of either type of substrate. We find that interchromosomal crossover recombination with these short substrates is severely inhibited {{in the absence of}} MSH 2, MSH 3, or RAD 1 and is relatively insensitive to the presence of mismatches. We propose that crossover recombination with these short substrates requires the products of MSH 2, MSH 3, and RAD 1 and that these proteins have functions in recombination in addition to the removal of terminal nonhomology. We further propose that the observed insensitivity to <b>homeology</b> {{is a result of the}} difference in recombinational mechanism and/or the timing of the observed recombination events. These results are in contrast with those obtained using longer substrates and may be particularly relevant to recombination events between the abundant short repeated sequences that characterize the genomes of higher eukaryotes...|$|E

40|$|Alu {{elements}} make up {{the largest}} family of human mobile elements, numbering 1. 1 million copies and comprising 11 % of the human genome. As a consequence of evolution and genetic drift, Alu elements of various sequence divergence exist throughout the human genome. Alu/Alu recombination {{has been shown to}} cause approximately 0. 5 % of new human genetic diseases and contribute to extensive genomic structural variation. To begin understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to these rearrangements in mammalian cells, we constructed Alu/Alu recombination reporter cell lines containing Alu elements ranging in sequence divergence from 0 %- 30 % that allow detection of both Alu/Alu recombination and large non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) deletions that range from 1. 0 to 1. 9 kb in size. Introduction of as little as 0. 7 % sequence divergence between Alu elements resulted in a significant reduction in recombination, which indicates even small degrees of sequence divergence reduce the efficiency of homology-directed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Further reduction in recombination was observed in a sequence divergence-dependent manner for diverged Alu/Alu recombination constructs with up to 10 % sequence divergence. With greater levels of sequence divergence (15 %- 30 %), we observed a significant increase in DSB repair due to a shift from Alu/Alu recombination to variable-length NHEJ which removes sequence between the two Alu elements. This increase in NHEJ deletions depends on the presence of Alu sequence <b>homeology</b> (similar but not identical sequences). Analysis of recombination products revealed that Alu/Alu recombination junctions occur more frequently in the first 100 bp of the Alu element within our reporter assay, just as they do in genomic Alu/Alu recombination events. This is the first extensive study characterizing the influence of Alu element sequence divergence on DNA repair, which will inform predictions regarding the effect of Alu element sequence divergence on both the rate and nature of DNA repair events...|$|E

A. abramis had diploid chromosome number 2 n= 50 (4 m+ 30 sm+ 8 st+ 8 a) and single AgNORs (pair 22), A. asuncionensis had 2 n= 50 (8 m+ 24 sm+ 6 st+ 12 a) and single AgNORs (pair 20), Astyanax sp. had 2 n= 50 (4 m+ 26 sm+ 8 st+ 12 a) and single AgNORs (pair 25), and A. correntinus had 2 n= 36 (12 m+ 16 sm+ 2 st+ 6 a) and multiple AgNORs (pairs 12, 15, 16, 17). FISH with 18 S rDNA showed a single site for A. abramis, A. asuncionensis and Astyanax sp. and multiple for A. correntinus (14 sites). FISH with 5 S rDNA showed single 5 S-bearing loci chromosome pair only for A. asuncionensis and multiple for A. abramis (four sites), A. correntinus (five sites) and Astyanax sp. (four sites). Distinct distribution patterns of heterochromatin were observed for karyotypes of all species, {{with the exception of}} the first acrocentric chromosome pair characterized by centromeric, interstitial-proximal and telomeric blocks of heterochromatin on the long arm, which may represent <b>homeology</b> between karyotypes of A. abramis and A. asuncionensis. Our study showed species-specific characteristics which can serve in diagnosis and differentiation between A. abramis and A. asuncionensis, considered cryptic species, as well as strengthening the occurrence of a species of Astyanax not yet described taxonomically. In addition, the data obtained from first cytogenetic studies in A. correntinus suggest a high similarity with A. schubarti Britski, 1964, suggesting that these species may belong to the same morphological group and that can be phylogenetically related...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For anurans, {{knowledge}} of 5 S rDNA is scarce. For Engystomops species, chromosomal homeologies {{are difficult to}} recognize due to {{the high level of}} inter- and intraspecific cytogenetic variation. In an attempt to better compare the karyotypes of the Amazonian species Engystomops freibergi and Engystomops petersi, and to extend the {{knowledge of}} 5 S rDNA organization in anurans, the 5 S rDNA sequences of Amazonian Engystomops species were isolated, characterized, and mapped. Results Two types of 5 S rDNA, which were readily differentiated by their NTS (non-transcribed spacer) sizes and compositions, were isolated from specimens of E. freibergi from Brazil and E. petersi from two Ecuadorian localities (Puyo and Yasuní). In the E. freibergi karyotypes, the entire type I 5 S rDNA repeating unit hybridized to the pericentromeric region of 3 p, whereas the entire type II 5 S rDNA repeating unit mapped to the distal region of 6 q, suggesting a differential localization of these sequences. The type I NTS probe clearly detected the 3 p pericentromeric region in the karyotypes of E. freibergi and E. petersi from Puyo and the 5 p pericentromeric region in the karyotype of E. petersi from Yasuní, but no distal or interstitial signals were observed. Interestingly, this probe also detected many centromeric regions in the three karyotypes, suggesting the presence of a satellite DNA family derived from 5 S rDNA. The type II NTS probe detected only distal 6 q regions in the three karyotypes, corroborating the differential distribution of the two types of 5 S rDNA. Conclusions Because the 5 S rDNA types found in Engystomops are related to those of Physalaemus with respect to their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal locations, their origin likely preceded the evolutionary divergence of these genera.
