It focuses on Education Policy in EU and Lifelong Learning Programme which was concentrated on Education and Training in 2007 - 2014. Since 2014 the programme {{has a new}} form and a new name, Erasmus+. New programme connects six existing programs into a single framework which covers Education, Training, Youth and Sport. In the final part is presented the practical example of completing funding application form to support projects in the education area. The completed form {{can serve as a}} <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> future <b>applicants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Of 27 {{children}} considered educationally handicapped (EH) {{who were}} screened by a psychological-medical team, 24 {{were eligible for}} a special pilot class for neurologically handicapped (brain damaged) children. Eight children {{were placed in the}} special class and made consistently greater gains in 10 scores, academic skills, and general behavior than the 14 remaining in regular classrooms. The multi-author report of the program provides a summary and background information, results, and a neurological appraisal of the hyperkinetic child. Also described are suggested environment, basic philosophy, and a <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> screening <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> special programs and classes for EH children.

40|$|This {{research}} project is {{an exploration of}} the preparation and process involved in successfully auditioning for a professional violoncello position in an Australian Symphony Orchestra. The aim of this {{research project}} is to serve as a <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> an <b>applicant</b> preparing <b>for</b> a successful audition. A professional audition is a unique high-pressure situation. An applicant is instantly assessed on a variety of skills, with lasting impressions being formed from the moment the panel hears the first note. This thesis will discuss the literature surrounding this topic, as well as, findings from interviews with professional Australian orchestral cellists. Furthermore, I will provide a 'toolkit' for the aspiring professional. This will examine the audition process, looking into the criteria assessed during an audition, and performance outcomes. Finally, Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 2 in D major will be discussed to illustrate the various factors that a cellist must deliberate before undertaking a professional audition with this work...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the teoretical part of {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to acquaint {{the reader with}} historical evolution of credit cards and card associations, technological innovations of recent years, typology of payment cards and evolution of used technology. Aim of the practical part is to analyze credit cards provided by three "major players" on czech market. Further to compare these products and to evaulate the most profitable product from the selected. Practical part of this thesis is instrumental as a <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> potential <b>applicant</b> of credit card product as well this part outlines recommendations, which should the <b>applicant</b> use <b>for</b> a decision. The aims of the practical part I have achieved with help of methods of analysis, comparison and description. Contribution of my bachelor thesis is provided quidance what all is neccesary to focuse on, which categories of fees to analyze and how to correctly evaluate these categories to a potencial applicant of a credit card.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{deals with}} the legal aspects of debt relief. Debt relief {{is one of the}} ways of resolving insolvency, which was incorporated in the Czech legislation in 2008. The first part contains a literature review and also analyzes the applicable legislation and the case law issued. In the second part the work deals with indebtedness of households. The third part provides a practical "how-to" <b>for</b> debtors. It <b>guides</b> an <b>applicant</b> <b>for</b> debt relief around the steps of the insolvency proceedings. This proceeding is initiated by filing an insolvency petition, together with a proposal for permission for debt relief. The work then deals with proceedings before the decision on the bankruptcy. This procedure is followed by proceedings after decisions on bankruptcy and leads the debtor to the completion of insolvency proceedings resolution of the court to meet all the statutory conditions. The debtor is subsequently exempted from paying claims...|$|R
40|$|The "Road Infrastructure Safety Management Evaluation Tools (RISMET) " project targets {{objective}} A (Development {{of evaluation}} tools) of the Joint Call for Proposals for Safety at the Heart of Road Design ("The Call"). This project aims at developing suitable road safety engineering evaluation tools that {{will support the}} aims of the Call as described in the <b>Guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>Applicants</b> (GfA) and furthermore those of the Directive for Road Infrastructure Safety Management (2008). These evaluation tools allow the easy identification of both unsafe (from accidents or related indicators) and potentially unsafe (from design and other criteria) locations in a road network. With such evaluation tools estimates of potential benefits at the local and the network level can be calculated and potential effects on aspects such as driver behaviour can be estimated. Such tools empower road authorities to improve their decision making and to implement (ameliorative) measures to improve the road safety situation on the roads. Since evaluation tools rely on good quality data, RISMET aims at reviewing available data sources for effective road infrastructure safety management in EU-countries, linked to a quick scan and assessment of current practices. Furthermore, RISMET aims at exploiting results related to the development and use of Accident Prediction Models (APMs) in road safety management. The present deliverable provides APMs for data collected at junctions from the rural road networks of Austria, Norway, Portugal and Holland. For the first three countries it was possible to obtain accident prediction models for each country individually. For Holland, however, and due to restrictions on the dimension of the data set, it was only possible to analyse these data together with the other countries data, i. e. analysing aggregated data sets. The data consists, per junction, of injury accident counts, type of junction, traffic control, speed limit and annual average daily traffics entering from the major and the minor road. The regression models had the injury accident frequencies as the dependent variable and the remaining variables as explanatory and were fitted using Bayesian statistical techniques with vague or non-informative prior and hyper-prior distributions. These models consisted on the Poisson regression model, hierarchical Poisson-Gamma and Poisson Log-Normal hierarchical regression model. The Poisson regression model was found to be not appropriate to model the junction data in any of the data sets due to not being able to capture variations and attributes of the data, namely the over-dispersion. The Poisson-Gamma and the Poisson Log-Normal models obtained similar results and in general performed equally well. It was found that accidents occurring at junctions in all countries depend on the junction’s entering traffic volume {{as well as the other}} explanatory variables considered. This report provides descriptions of the several data sets, equations for the expected injury accident frequencies, per year, on rural road network junctions for Austria, Norway and Portugal and for the conjoint set of the combined data (including Dutch data) as well as posterior means of the expected number of accidents for minimum, mean, median and maximum profiles obtained by the explanatory variables and measurements of model fit together with the major results obtained.
