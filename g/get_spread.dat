An algorithm for solving a linear evolutionary partial differential equation is stable if the total variation of the numerical solution at a fixed time remains bounded as the step size goes to zero. The Lax equivalence theorem states that an algorithm converges if it is consistent and stable (in this sense). Stability is sometimes achieved by including numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion is a mathematical term which ensures that roundoff and other errors in the calculation <b>get</b> <b>spread</b> out and do {{not add up to}} cause the calculation to [...] "blow up". Von Neumann stability analysis is a commonly used procedure for the stability analysis of finite difference schemes as applied to linear partial differential equations. These results do not hold for nonlinear PDEs, where a general, consistent definition of stability is complicated by many properties absent in linear equations.|$|E

50|$|Foot-binding {{was created}} for several reasons. First, foot-binding is {{actually}} created by a women to please men. YaoNiang, a concubine of the king at that time, LiYu, used silk to bind her feet into shape of moon and danced wearing “Golden Lotus”, a three-inch-long shoe {{in order to make}} the king happy. After that, this procedure of foot-binding <b>get</b> <b>spread</b> around the country and created a new set of values. “Impossibly small, these feet were originally a source of great pride. Small feet added prestige to a family.” If a woman has a smaller foot, she is considered more beautiful and more valuable. Instead of considering one’s ability, intelligence, face and body, size of the feet is the only standard of evaluating a women in old Chinese society. Second, in male-dominated China, leaders of the country are afraid of women taking away their power because women can reproduce and create labor force and even army. In order to eliminate this threat and maintain the power, male leaders gives “the cultural necessity that a woman properly orient her body—that is bend it to the will of male authority”. “Through the bending, twisting, and compressing of the feet, a girl’s sense of managing space was radically modified”. Foot-binding not only constrains women’s mind, it also physically makes women weaker. Women begin foot-binding at age five and when women finally finished this cruel procedure around at age fifteen, women’s feet are distorted beyond recognition and can barely run, not mentioning starting a war.|$|E

40|$|Growing chain orientational {{preference}} {{is one of}} the key factors determining the stereoselectivity of olefin polymerization and related reactions such as carboalumination; alpha-agostic interactions are an important component of this preference. Using insertion of ethene in the M-CH 3 bond as a model, the intrinsic orientational preference was evaluated for a number of important catalyst types through determination of the energy profile for methyl group rotation at the insertion TS. Ti and Zr metallocenes show a pronounced preference (Ti, 10 kcal/mol; Zr, 6 kcal/mol) for a classical a-agostic arrangement with a single short MÂ·Â·Â·CH contact and an elongated C-H bond; on CH 3 rotation the agostic elongation mostly disappears.

40|$|Clustered microarchitectures are an {{attractive}} alternative to large monolithic superscalar designs {{due to their}} potential for higher clock rates {{in the face of}} increasingly wire-delay-constrained process technologies.

As a result of the emergence of this trade-off between communication and parallelism, a subset of the total on-chip clusters is optimal for performance. To match the hardware to the application’s needs, we use a robust algorithm to dynamically tune the clustered architecture. The algorithm, which is based on program metrics gathered at periodic intervals, achieves an 11 % performance improvement on average over the best statically defined architecture. We also show that the use of additional hardware and reconfiguration at basic block boundaries can achieve average improvements of 15 %. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguration provides an effective solution to the communication and parallelism trade-off inherent in the communicationbound processors of the future. 1...|$|E
