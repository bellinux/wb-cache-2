25|$|The Seventh Symphony was {{actually}} a convenient target from the start for Western critics. It was considered a strange, ungainly hybrid of Mahler and Stravinsky—too long, too broad-gestured in narrative and overly emotional in tone. Shostakovich placed the work's emphasis {{on the effect of}} musical images rather than on symphonic coherence. Those images—stylized fanfares, march rhythms, ostinati, folkloric themes and pastoral episodes—could easily be considered models of socialist realism. Because of his emphasis on these images, Shostakovich can be said to have allowed the work's message to outweigh its craftsmanship. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> the music was considered both naïve and calculated in the West.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact number}} is unknown. Since these figures include {{estimates}} {{of the total number}} of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best {{estimates of the}} number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred.

25|$|Beyond {{this point}} the area is at present geologically less stable. This {{instability}} is presently {{in the course of}} being corrected with a circa £100M project co-ordinated by Telford & Wrekin District Council, repairs intended to safeguard the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage site for the next 100 years, although these repairs are not designed to cope with the extra loads imposed by the reinstatement of the railway through the Gorge civil engineering consultants opine that these additional loads are insignificant in relation to those to be carried by the present design. At present a road occupies the route of the railway formation for a distance at Jackfield built to replace the original road damaged {{as a result of the}} 1954 land instability. At this point utility services for the area are carried on runners beside the road as the instability makes it impossible to maintain them underground. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> reopening is not being actively pursued by the SVR itself, particularly since recovery from the effects of the 2007 floods damage will take time.

25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

500|$|... "True social-cost pricing of {{metropolitan}} travel {{has proven to}} be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, a {{previously}} unpublished private account written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party's archives, appeared in L'Unità.

Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and, because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived {{that he had no}} motivation other than to tell the truth.

500|$|In 1961, the Christmas Candle {{fell into}} a state of disrepair, and the {{contractors}} who assemble the candle for discounted prices in previous years informed the city they could not handle the project again.

The candle was placed into storage at an old incinerator plant on Pennsylvania Route 611, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee sought alternative decorations for its holiday program. In 1961, 24 streams of multi-colored Christmas light strands (totaling 2,650 bulbs) were draped {{from the top of the}} monument to the edges of Centre Square, creating an umbrella-like shape of lights. More than 200 Christmas Trees were also placed around the base of the monument, along with a nativity scene and Christmas light decorations on the nearby bridges. The set-up cost only $2,000, compared to the average $3,000 for the Christmas Candle display.

2500|$|The {{iconographic}} {{identification of}} Livilla has posed many problems to date, mainly {{due to the}} damnatio memoriae voted against her by the Senate after her death.

All these replicas show the head of a lady in her blossom years, with a hairstyle clearly from the Tiberian period.

2500|$|Another {{important}} factor behind Costa Rica's poverty {{was the lack}} of a significant indigenous population available for encomienda (forced labor), which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large haciendas (plantations). <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> Costa Rica was, by and large, unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own.

Costa Rica became a [...] "rural democracy" [...] with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class.

2500|$|Supplementary [...] "protein substitute" [...] {{formulas}} {{are typically}} prescribed for people PKU (starting in infancy) {{to provide the}} amino acids and other necessary nutrients {{that would otherwise be}} lacking in a low-phenylalanine diet. Tyrosine, which is normally derived from phenylalanine and which is necessary for normal brain function, is usually supplemented. Consumption of the protein substitute formulas can actually reduce phenylalanine levels, probably because it stops the process of [...] protein catabolism from releasing Phe stored in the muscles and other tissues into the blood. Many PKU patients have their highest Phe levels after a period of fasting (such as overnight), because fasting triggers catabolism. A diet that is low in phenylalanine but does not include protein substitutes may also fail to lower blood Phe levels, since a nutritionally insufficient diet may also trigger catabolism. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> the prescription formula {{is an important part of}} the treatment for patients with classic PKU.|$|E
