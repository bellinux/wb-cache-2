5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the <b>double-column,</b> dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a <b>double-column,</b> single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the <b>double-column</b> (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a <b>double-column</b> plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in the}} design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a <b>double-column,</b> double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
2500|$|The M3/M3A1's 30-round {{magazine}} {{was the source}} of complaints throughout the service life of the weapon. [...] Unlike the Thompson, the M3 fed from a <b>double-column,</b> single-feed detachable box magazine which held 30 rounds and was patterned after the British Sten magazine; the single-feed design proved difficult to load by hand, and was more easily jammed by mud, dust, and dirt than <b>double-column,</b> double-feed designs like the Thompson. [...] Additionally, the feed lips of the single-feed design proved more susceptible to feed malfunctions when slightly bent or damaged. Plastic dust caps were later issued to cover the feed end of the magazine and keep out dust as well as protect the sensitive feed lips.|$|E

2500|$|The 9mm and [...]40 S {{versions}} use <b>double-column</b> box magazines; the 9mm has a 15-round capacity, and the [...]40 has a 10-round capacity. The [...]45 ACP versions use single-column magazines holding {{seven or}} eight rounds (depending on the model). All P-Series pistols of the same caliber use a similar magazine design, but slight modifications {{have been made to}} at least the 9mm guns so that not all P-Series magazines will function in all P-Series frames. Ruger did not keep track of the magazine models so an older magazine may not secure in a newer frame. The Ruger Police Carbine also uses P-Series magazines. The P-Series pistols have an ambidextrous magazine release located behind the trigger guard; it can be pushed forward from either side to eject the magazine.|$|E
2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, <b>double-column</b> magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E

The two side entrances for pedestrians were not added until 1843, under Frederick William IV, in order to cope with the increase in pedestrian traffic.|$|R

5|$|Varney the Vampire was a {{landmark}} popular mid-Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 {{in a series}} of pamphlets generally referred to as penny dreadfuls because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents. The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 <b>double-columned</b> pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu's lesbian vampire story Carmilla (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.|$|R
