5|$|Rio Dewanto as Hendra (Ping Hen), {{the son of}} Tan Kat Sun and Lim Giok Lie. He {{constantly}} argues {{with his}} parents, especially about running the restaurant. He {{falls in love with}} Menuk, but she rejects <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> is not Muslim. After the death of his father, he converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|This {{ordnance}} {{duty was}} {{not new to}} <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had been {{closely associated with the}} development of small arms marksmanship within the Marine Corps. In 1921, he had been a firing member of the winning Marine Corps Team at the National Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio. In 1927, 1930, and 1931, he served with the rifle and pistol teams as assistant coach. During the regional matches of 1932 and 1933, he acted as team coach and captain, respectively. Upon the resumption of the National Matches in 1935, he was captain of the Marine Corps national rifle and pistol teams of 1935 and 1936, winning the national trophies in both years.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
50|$|Frankie and {{his gang}} members, Louie, Matty and Biggie, come to the lodge. They are {{suspicious}} of Dan, but Bonnie vouches for <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>he's</b> {{said to be a}} doctor, Frankie demands that Dan remove the bullet from his arm. He sends Louie into town to get the necessary instruments.|$|R
50|$|Her father gets a {{promotion}} and {{they move to}} New York City. Chantal gets picked up on Fifth Avenue by Eugene Wright (Bobby Darin), who invites her to model for <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he's</b> a photographer. Her father punches Gene,after seeing the skimpy costume Chantal is modeling, but, with her mother's advice, she marries Gene. He refuses to let Chantal model, now that she’s his wife.|$|R

5|$|The sultan besieged him and {{discovered}} {{him in a}} certain mountain where the Wallachian {{was supported by the}} natural strength of the place. There Vlad had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or {{fall into the hands of}} the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge themselves against the enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, who had been caught at twilight when they were wandering about imprudently, at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped like lightning in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander (a boyar named Galeş) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain from which he had come. No one dared pursue <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had caused such terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And he would have continued to this way, had he not been reprimanded by his friends and brought back, almost against his will.|$|E

25|$|ThunderClan {{discusses}} Ashfur's murder, {{and many}} {{think that a}} WindClan cat killed <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> {{was found on the}} WindClan border. To find out, Firestar sends a patrol to WindClan, but Onestar denies the possibility. As the patrol leaves, Ashfoot tells ThunderClan that she sighted Sol near the sight of Ashfur's dead body, and this leads to the thought that Sol killed Ashfur.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{looked at}} him closely. She had not seen <b>him</b> <b>since</b> Breadalby. <b>He</b> was very thin and hollow, with a ghastly look in his face.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's a good idee!" [...] Carrots replied, enthusiastically. [...] "Why, I'll bet {{you could}} get any {{quantity}} of 'em at that rate. Say, there's one up on Rivington Street. I used to black his boots last year, when I worked 'round that way; but haven't seen <b>him</b> <b>since.</b> <b>He's</b> awful nice; ain't so very old either, an' a good many times give me something extra when I got though with my job." ...|$|R
25|$|Kessel was {{actually}} searching for <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had a film project in Afghanistan, The Devil's Pass, {{and he wanted}} Schoendoerffer to direct it. Kessel wrote the script, Raoul Coutard, a First Indochina War photograph (SPI) veteran {{was in charge of}} the cinematography on his first film (later he would join Jean-Luc Godard), Jacques Dupont assisted Schoendoerffer with the direction and Georges de Beauregard produced it.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} later, Velu returns to Pavunoor for Kaveri's marriage. Unknown to him, {{the leader of}} a {{terrorist}} group Muzamin Ibrahim (Abhimanyu Singh) follows him to the village. Ibrahim wants to kill <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he,</b> in the garb of Velayudham, had thwarted every terrorist attack he had planned in Chennai. On the day of Kaveri's marriage, a bomb planted by Ibrahim at Velu's house explodes, killing Kaveri.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 {{season was}} Burnett's last with the Marlins {{before he became}} {{eligible}} for free agency. As former teammate Carl Pavano had done in the 2004 off-season, he wanted to test the market rather than take whatever new contract the Marlins gave <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> was likely to price {{himself out of the}} Marlins' budget, he was sought after by several other teams before the July 31 trade deadline, but he ended up not being traded.|$|E

25|$|French police {{identified}} the perpetrator as Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old man of Tunisian nationality, born in Tunisia, with a French residency permit {{and living in}} Nice. His parents live in Tunisia and rarely heard from <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> moved to France in 2005. His father said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel underwent psychiatric treatment before he moved to France. He married a French-Tunisian cousin, living in Nice, {{with whom he had}} three children. According to his wife's lawyer, he was repeatedly reported for domestic violence and the couple separated.|$|E
25|$|Birbal {{comes from}} Bir Bar or Vir Var which means courageous and great, quite {{contrary}} for <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> {{was not known}} for his bravery or for his military skill. Akbar gave titles to his Hindu subjects according to their traditions and S. H. Hodivala writes {{that it could have}} been taken from a character in the folk tale Vetal Panchvinshati. This featured a courtier called Vir Var who showed great loyalty to his king. Akbar was also fond of literature, having works of Sanskrit and other local languages translated into Persian.|$|E
25|$|Kirby's {{production}} assistant of the time, Mark Evanier, recounted that DC's {{policies of the}} era were not in synch with Kirby's creative impulses, {{and that he was}} often forced to work on characters and projects he did not like. Meanwhile, some artists at DC did not want Kirby there, as he threatened their positions in the company; they also had bad blood from previous competition with Marvel and legal problems with <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> was working from the west coast, they were able to undermine his work through redesigns in the New York office.|$|E
5000|$|Sergeant Sisk confronts Marvin, and {{is about}} to shoot him. Suddenly, the other [...] "animal" [...] jumps from a tree and attacks sisk. The beast is Rianna. Now, the crowd finds them both {{together}} but Miles is there, and takes the blame for everything. He has been claiming that there is reverse discrimination with <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he's</b> black, and that no one wants to hold him accountable for anything. Sure enough, once the mob thinks a black man was responsible, they don't care anymore, and leave.|$|R
50|$|Eleanor is Felten's fiancée and {{has been}} in love with <b>him</b> <b>since</b> they were children. She wants to marry <b>him,</b> but <b>since</b> <b>he's</b> a womanizer he refuses to do so.

25|$|A {{camera crew}} from News 12, a cable news channel in the New York {{metropolitan}} area, accompanied {{the police to}} film the search operation for its broadcast. Bonie, {{who had not been}} present when officers arrived, was livid when he returned and found the search in progress. He claimed the police were harassing <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had already spoken to them and allowed them to search Moore's apartment several times. Later, he accused the police of stealing $40,000 in cash from the basement during the search, an allegation the department denied. A suit he filed over the allegedly missing money is pending.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, he took {{command of}} the 61st Fighter Squadron when its {{commanding}} officer was moved up to group deputy commander. This also stirred ill feelings toward <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had been jumped over two more senior pilots. This ill will was soon exacerbated when both of these men were lost in combat on June 26 and did not subside until he recorded his first credited kill: an Fw 190 near Dreux, France, on August 24, 1943. His first kill presaged criticism that followed him throughout his combat career, when his wingmen complained that his attack had been too hastily conducted {{to allow them to}} also engage.|$|E
25|$|Modern Hindu {{scholars}} {{assert that}} he made Akbar make bold decisions and the orthodox Muslims in the court despised <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> made Akbar renounce Islam. But no evidence is present that he influenced Akbar's beliefs. Though sources suggest he influenced Akbar's policies to some extent. It was Akbar's affection for him, his religious tolerance and social liberalism which {{was the reason for}} this and Birbal was not the cause. Historically, he was more of a supporter of Akbar's religious policy and his religion, Din-i-Ilahi. Ain-i-Akbari mentions an incident involving prostitutes, where Akbar wanted to punish him, contrary to how he is portrayed as a deeply religious man.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> {{now has to}} live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, they gained one day upon crossing the International Date Line. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake, and Fogg hurries to the Reform Club {{just in time to}} meet his deadline and win the wager. Having already spent the bulk of the £20,000 during the journey, he divides the remaining money between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.|$|E
25|$|Richards {{maintained}} cordial relations {{after breaking}} up with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d. June 13, 2017), {{the mother of his}} first three children. Richards and Pallenberg, who never married, were a couple from 1967 to 1979. Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972. Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne (after Richards' and Pallenberg's friend Guinness heir Tara Browne), died on 6 June 1976 at just over two months old of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted <b>him</b> <b>since.</b> <b>He</b> was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said {{it was the only way}} he could cope.|$|E
25|$|Ip {{attends the}} {{ceremony}} and defeats his first challengers, before striking a draw {{with the last}} challenger, Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school {{on the condition that}} he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun School and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames <b>him</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't pay his protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and also insists they finish their fight, but during this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears, earning respect from him. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.|$|E
