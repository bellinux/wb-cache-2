40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the clinical productivity of dental <b>interns</b> at King Saud University College of Dentistry (KSU-CD) in Riyadh (KSA) by setting a numerical target to drive clinical activity, monitor performance, and establish future trends. The clinical records of seventy <b>interns</b> of the <b>Interns</b> Training Program at KSU-CD were analyzed in this study over a six-month period. Great variations in productivity exist among dental <b>interns.</b> Female <b>interns</b> received more patients and spent less treatment time with them. <b>Interns</b> performed tooth extractions, pulpotomies, and restorations most frequently, whereas prosthodontics, periodontics and preventive dentistry were the least practiced. It can be concluded that performance and productivity of dental <b>interns</b> need to be revised in general, as they did not completely fulfill the listed objectives of <b>interns</b> training program. Thus, corrective measures should be taken into consideration to improve the clinical performance, and treatment outcomes, based on preventive approaches. King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the level of {{awareness}} on Hepatitis-B infection among medical and dental <b>interns</b> in Pondicherry, India. Material and methods:Questionnaire containing a set of 20 different questions on Hepatitis B infection was distributed among 64 medical and 49 dental <b>Interns</b> of Arupadai Veedu Medical College and Mahatma Gandhi Dental College, Pondicherry, India, respectively. Results: The majority of <b>interns</b> (94. 7 %) were aware that Hepatitis B virus is the major cause of Hepatitis. About 33. 6 and 59. 3 % of <b>interns</b> had very good and moderate knowledge respectively. The study shows that dental <b>interns</b> (34. 7 %) had better awareness than medical <b>interns</b> (32. 8 %). About 52. 2 % believed that Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted by semen and vaginal secretions. Only 39. 9 % of the <b>interns</b> believed that doctors, dentists infected with HBV should not have direct contact with patients. Conclusion: One- third of the <b>interns</b> had very good knowledge about Hepatitis B. The majority had good knowledge regarding the mode of transmission and attitude towards HBV patients. However, there is a misconception about prophylaxis, vaccination and treatment of HBV. Hence there is an imperative need for health education to improve the knowledge and attitude of the <b>interns</b> towards Hepatitis B...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Theories {{from the}} {{psychology}} of communication may be applicable in understanding why hand-off communication is inherently problematic. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess whether postcall pediatric <b>interns</b> can correctly estimate the patient care information and rationale received by on-call <b>interns</b> during hand-off communication. METHODS: Pediatric <b>interns</b> at the University of Chicago were interviewed about the hand-off. Postcall <b>interns</b> were asked to predict what on-call <b>interns</b> would report as the important pieces of information communicated during the hand-off about each patient, with accompanying rationale. Postcall <b>interns</b> also guessed on-call interns' rating of how well the hand-offs went. Then, on-call <b>interns</b> were asked to list the most important pieces of information for each patient that postcall <b>interns</b> communicated during the hand-off, with accompanying rationale. On-call <b>interns</b> also rated how well the hand-offs went. <b>Interns</b> had access to written hand-offs during the interviews. RESULTS: We conducted 52 interviews, which constituted 59 % of eligible interviews. Seventy-two patients were discussed. The most important piece of information about a patient was not successfully communicated 60 % of the time, despite the postcall intern's believing that it was communicated. Postcall and on-call <b>interns</b> did not agree on the rationales provided for 60 % of items. In addition, an item was more likely to be effectively communicated when it was a to-do item (65 %) or an item related to anticipatory guidance (69 %) compared with a knowledge item (38 %). Despite the lack of agreement on content and rationale of information communicated during hand-offs, peer ratings of hand-off quality were high. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric <b>interns</b> overestimated the effectiveness of their hand-off communication. Theories from communication psychology suggest that miscommunication is caused by egocentric thought processes and a tendency for the speaker to overestimate the receiver's understanding. This study demonstrates that systematic causes of miscommunication may play a role in hand-off quality...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The European Working Time Regulations (EWTR) {{have been}} criticised for its purported {{negative}} impact on the training of junior doctors. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the amount of time <b>interns</b> spent engaging in various work activities. Design. An online time-use diary was used to collect data from <b>interns.</b> Setting. Two teaching hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. Participants. A total of 45 <b>interns</b> logged at least one 24 hour period. The logs were obtained from 67 shifts from a surgical rotation and 83 shifts from a medical rotation. Main outcome measures. The amount of time <b>interns</b> spent engaging in direct patient care, indirect patient care, educational activities, and personal activities. Results. On day shift, medical <b>interns</b> spent a significantly smaller proportion of the shift on direct care (159 / 613 minutes, 25. 9 %, versus 214 / 636 minutes, 33. 6 %) and a greater proportion on education (195 / 613 minutes, 31. 8 %, versus 139 / 636 minutes, 21. 9 %) than surgical <b>interns.</b> On extended days, medical <b>interns</b> spent a significantly larger proportion of the shift on education than surgical <b>interns</b> (243 / 814 minutes, 29. 9 %, versus 126 / 804, 15. 7 % minutes). On night shift, medical <b>interns</b> spent a significantly greater proportion of the shift on direct care (590 / 720 minutes, 81. 9 %, versus 346 / 727 minutes, 47. 6 %) and education (33 / 720 minutes, 4. 6 %, versus 6 / 727 minutes, 0. 8 %) than surgical <b>interns.</b> Conclusions. The <b>interns</b> in the study reported spending more time on direct patient care and educational activities, and less time on indirect patient care activities than <b>interns</b> in other countries.

In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas {{on the spur of the}} moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow <b>intern</b> Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{research}} conducted to achieve three general purposes: (1) determine {{the characteristics of}} Kentucky's 1997 - 98 principal and assistant principal <b>interns</b> and whether their work differed; (2) ascertain whether work differences existed among <b>interns</b> according to gender or school level [...] elementary, middle, or high; and (3) to investigate possible changes, including effects of reform initiatives such as high-stakes accountability on the roles of 1997 - 98 first-year principal and assistant principal <b>interns.</b> For the study, all principal <b>interns</b> and assistant principal <b>interns</b> that were employed in Kentucky's public schools during the 1997 - 98 school year were surveyed. An analysis of the 134 surveys that were returned (87 percent) found that the self-reported administrative duties of principal <b>interns</b> were significantly different from those reported by assistant principal <b>interns.</b> Assistant principals did not assume responsibility for the same administrative duties or "work " that principal <b>interns</b> performed. Not only was there a disparity in the work, {{but there was a}} pervasive difference in the magnitude or degree of assistant principal involvement. Only 4 of 80 duties were identified by over 90 percent of assistant principal <b>interns</b> compared to 38 so identified by principal <b>interns.</b> The results suggest that the assistant principalship may provide less than "ideal " training for all facets of the principalship.
