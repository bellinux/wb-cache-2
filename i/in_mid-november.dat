5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River <b>in</b> <b>mid-November,</b> about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, Kongō was {{attacked}} by four Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, but she received no hits. <b>In</b> <b>mid-November,</b> this battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the unsuccessful mission by the I.J.N. to bombard Henderson Field again and to deliver more Army reinforcements to Guadalcanal.

5|$|In late October, the Beatles began {{a five-day}} tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg {{engagement}} of December 1962. On {{their return to}} the UK on 31 October several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. <b>In</b> <b>mid-November,</b> as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-November</b> 1942, Junyō was tasked {{to provide}} air {{cover for the}} convoy {{bringing}} reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three-day-long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The ship's fighters were unable to do so; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged. In December 1942 – January 1943, the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to Wewak, New Guinea and her air group was based there for several days to protect the forces there before returning to Truk on 20 January. The ship then covered the evacuation of forces from Guadalcanal through early February.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-November,</b> Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-November,</b> Breckinridge led a raid into northeastern Tennessee, driving Alvan Cullem Gillem's forces back to Knoxville at the Battle of Bull's Gap. On December 17–18, {{he faced}} a two-pronged attack from Union cavalry under Major General George Stoneman at the Battle of Marion in Virginia. Badly outnumbered on either flank, Breckinridge {{resisted}} Stoneman's forces until he ran low on ammunition. Stoneman's forces {{were able to}} damage Confederate salt works, lead mines, and railroads in the area, and destroy supply depots at Bristol and Abingdon. Finally restocked with ammunition after three days, Breckinridge was able to drive Stoneman – whose men were now short of ammunition themselves – out of the area.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely <b>in</b> <b>mid-November</b> 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E

By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E
