5|$|The highway through Keene Valley from Underwood to Keene {{was built}} by 1846. At its {{southern}} end, it connected to a major stagecoach road that connected Albany to the Canadian border. The route <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> rise of local lumber and tanning industries; up to 40 wagon loads of timber used the stagecoach route daily. Various hotels and taverns opened {{in the nearby town}} of North Hudson to serve travelers along the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} figure {{behind these}} accounts, Toghrul, {{was in fact}} a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis. He had <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> future Khan {{after the death of his}} father Yesugei and was one of his early allies, but the two had a falling-out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis' children, the rift between them grew until war broke out in 1203. Genghis captured Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter of Toghrul's brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son Tolui; they had several children, including Möngke, Kublai, Hulagu, and Ariq Böke.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E

5|$|Under Warren's leadership, {{the school}} grew steadily, adding Schools of Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. Against some {{influential}} opposition, Warren established his medical {{school on the}} UCLA campus rather than {{in another part of}} the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

5|$|Islamic {{contact with}} South India began {{as early as}} the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many mosques flourished on the Malabar coast by the early 14th century. Muslim {{settlers}} married local women; their children were known as Mappillas (Moplahs) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south. The introduction of Christianity began {{as early as the}} 8th century as shown by the finding of copper plates inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting its attractiveness to missionaries. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation of the faith by Saint Xavier (1545) and later the presence of Dutch settlements <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> growth of Christianity in the south.|$|E
5|$|Life in {{the colony}} was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, {{including}} the Indian massacre of 1622, which <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> colonists' negative view of all tribes. By 1624, only 3,400of the 6,000early settlers had survived. However, European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants. The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia. African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift {{to a system of}} African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away, and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655. Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.|$|E
5|$|Originally a Viking {{fishing village}} {{founded in the}} 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it {{consolidated}} its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering {{from the effects of}} plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better understand, from a foster parent perspective, how the {{integration}} process of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child is carried out in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family. <b>The</b> purpose is to identify the challenges and success factors in the process. The study is based on a qualitative method. The data consist of interviews with six <b>foster</b> families. <b>The</b> study’s theoretical framework is mostly based on system theory and also on the theory of ambivalence. The results show that most of our families considered five factors to be important in order to facilitate the integration process. <b>The</b> <b>foster</b> family needs to bond with <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child, let <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in into the family system, open up and be who they really are, respect each other and reserve time to be able to satisfy <b>the</b> needs of <b>foster</b> child. <b>The</b> results emphasize that <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> parents should treat <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in <b>the</b> same way as the biological child.   We have also been able to identify factors that may have an impact on integration, like the age of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child. Our results suggest that foster parents experience different varieties of ambivalence to both <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child and <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child's biological parents. Those children who have a poor relationship with their biological parents and are of relatively young age tend to be over-integrated in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family...|$|R

5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries <b>fostered</b> <b>the</b> rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E
