5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events {{from the perspective of}} the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

500|$|The fifth {{game has}} also {{received}} mixed reviews.

2500|$|... <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> {{place in}} the middle of nowhere with no {{facilities}} at all--and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> test of what we could do in that environment. Because by that time we'd become obsessed with change, and the great thing was that we were also able to create a pastoral side of Led Zep. Jimmy was listening to Davey Graham and Bert Jansch and was experimenting with different tunings, and I loved John Fahey. So it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very natural place for us to go to.|$|R

Teti praised both the {{writing and the}} acting in the bar scene writing that [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> run of writing during Clive and Juliana’s {{rendezvous}} at the bar, as every smooth Clive Bixby utterance stumbles out of Phil’s mouth {{with just the right}} amount of awkwardness".

5000|$|Popsuger of Buzzsugar gave a good {{review to}} the episode saying: [...] "Things {{definitely}} picked up steam, with some sauciness thrown {{in with a}} lot of goriness. Still, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> installment." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background.

Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> amount of talent on those shows." ...|$|E
500|$|Guest actor Jared Harris {{made his}} third {{appearance}} {{of the season in}} [...] "Ability". At the time, the actor had not heard whether his character would be returning, though he later appeared in the first season finale and five fourth season episodes. Harris described his character as an [...] "anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause" [...] and the episode as [...] "a page-turner... When I read it, I said, 'Ah, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> one. I can't wait to see it.' It's directed with a lot of energy, a lot of tension. It's a good one, a really good one".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just shot}} a Beyoncé video at the {{beginning}} of this last week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, which was fun, and I hadn't done a video since 2009. It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Redrum", {{described}} as a [...] "Twilight Zone-type thriller" [...] in The Complete X-Files, was developed by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin, while the teleplay was written solely by Maeda. Maeda purposely picked the title to be the backwards spelling of [...] "murder"; notably, the same plot device was used by novelist—and one-time X-Files writer—Stephen King in his book The Shining. Furthermore, Maeda used the spider and its web to symbolize Martin Wells' confusion at being trapped in his situation. Wells was played by noted actor Joe Morton who had previously {{played a role in}} the 1991 sci-fi film [...] Robert Patrick later noted that [...] "Joe Morton <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> actor. We never worked together in , but we're in that movie together. And Joe was The Brother from Another Planet." ...|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, the sequel, Godchild, {{received}} positive reviews. When {{the first}} chapter premiered in Shojo Beat, critics commented on the potiental and art of the series, but found the chapter [...] "listless" [...] and confusing. Reviews of the bound volumes were positive. Writing for The Book Report, Robin Brenner described the mysteries as [...] "unsettling, splatter-filled, and deliciously {{in line with the}} melodramatic, horrific traditions of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley." [...] Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons wrote: [...] "By turns bizarre and unsettling, Godchild is actually quite engaging, but can be difficult to follow for those who didn't come in at the beginning". Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil described Godchild as [...] "a masterpiece {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] In reviews of subsequent volumes, she lowered her score, and praised Yuki's characterization, mysteries, and artwork; she concluded: [...] "Godchild <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> and different story that can't be denied." ...|$|E

After winning the award, Celtic Supporters Association general secretary Eddie Toner said, [...] "The Fair Play Award <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> tribute to the Celtic supporters who represented the club in Europe so magnificently last season.

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 7.9 out of ten, enjoying the time overlaps, the {{relationship}} between Toshiko and Tommy {{and the appearance of}} previous Torchwood employees. However, he felt that some of the episode's plot elements strained the [...] "credibility of the mythology". Joan O'Connell Herdman of Slant Magazine enjoyed the characterisation and British historical perspective the episode afforded, though stated that [...] "characters make this episode, plot devices nearly destroy it." [...] She felt the main strength of the episode was the use of a science fiction crisis [...] "to frame a story about love and sacrifice, the horrors of war and the burdens of command". Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha felt that the episode succeeded in the atmosphere it created, opining that [...] "1918 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> setting for a ghost story" [...] and that like [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and [...] "Sleeper", the episode showed that [...] "all the [...] from the first season have been completely ironed out".|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Lloyd {{signed with}} {{expansion}} team Atlanta Beat for the 2011 season.

I have known her from her college days, and I {{have had the opportunity}} to train her and improve her game individually. She has made a lot of sacrifices off the field to reach her dreams, and she is going to bring a lot of professionalism to the team." [...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E

500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} month, {{the film was}} {{screened}} during the 2010 Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas.

Regarding the film's screening at the London Film Festival, Ishiguro said, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> privilege, I feel very lucky. To some extent it is a showcase for British talent and it's a tremendous honour".

500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fantastic</b> place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E
