5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in a Singapore of the 1920s and 1930s.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that}} kind of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in an {{atmosphere}} of Sanskrit literature and I have been dealing with the Sanskrit classics in and outside the classroom either as a student, or a teacher for the last sixty years.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

In January 2015, he joined Orphans in Need, an international NGO, as a Global Brand Ambassador and carried the charity's logo on his bat.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> on the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had {{come down from the}} Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in a religious family and I know without God {{none of this would}} be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E

Cinematographer Michael Reed added he had difficulties with lighting, as every set built for the film had a ceiling, preventing spotlights from being hung from above. While shooting, Hunt wanted [...] "the most interesting framings possible", which would also look good after being cropped for television.|$|E
