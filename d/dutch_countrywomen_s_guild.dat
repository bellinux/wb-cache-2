40|$|Lurelle Van Arsdale Guild (1898 - 1985) was {{an author}} and {{illustrator}} of interior decorating literature; a collector of Americana; a pioneering industrial designer; and an amateur architect. Both a popular antiquarian and a modernist, his diverse interests often intermingled in his industrial designs. This dissertation uses Guild's multifaceted and at times contradictory career, which lasted from the 1920 s to the 1960 s, to explore how modernism drew upon the legacy of colonial American design to create objects that appeared contemporary but were grounded in tradition. This study positions Guild as the archetypal "historical modernist" while creating a larger framework for exploring the intersection of historicism and modernism in American design. The dissertation's introduction and chapter one explore the stylistic plurality {{that existed in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s and introduce the term "historical modernism" as a way to define the aesthetic and ideological overlaps between the era's dominant styles: the Colonial Revival and modernism. Chapters two and three focus on Guild's early career as {{an author and}} illustrator promoting traditional taste. The persona he created of the "Itinerant Antiquer" reflected his interest in early American decorative arts and architectural elements, which he and his wife collected and installed at Milestone Village, their property in Connecticut. Chapter four looks at how Guild's personal collection informed his work as an industrial designer. In the 1930 <b>s,</b> <b>Guild</b> became a leading figure in the nascent field of industrial design. He drew upon his knowledge of Americana to create hybrid objects that appeared modern but were informed by the past and reflected the ambivalence many American consumers felt towards modernism. Chapter five explores the postwar years when Guild began to retreat from modernism. Instead, he focused on historicist design projects and became an amateur architect, building series of historical fantasy houses. Most histories of American modernism have disproportionately focused on forward-looking designs. This dissertation uses the work and biography of Lurelle Guild to reintroduce the idea of aesthetic pluralism into the historiography of modernist design and explores the legacy of the Colonial past on modernism in America...|$|R
40|$|London 2 ̆ 7 s {{early modern}} brewing trade was a dynamic {{one that was}} {{constantly}} in flux throughout the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. This dissertation seeks to better understand how issues of gender, ethnicity, and class changed and shaped London 2 ̆ 7 s early modern brewing industry. Women played {{a vital role in}} the production and marketing of ale in London 2 ̆ 7 s medieval brewing trade. They were displaced from that position of prominence through the introduction of hops by foreign immigrants, known to strangers to their hosts, and the desire of the City of London to more closely regulate the trade in ale and beer. Those forces combined to marginalize women in the trade as they were replaced by male strangers brewing beer. Those strangers came to control the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century brewing trade. Their product, beer, was superior to English ale in durability and cost less to produce. As London began to transition from an ale-drinking community to a beer-drinking one, the community of beer-brewing strangers came under attack on several fronts. Their guild, the Beer Brewers chartered in 1493, was consolidated within Ale Brewers 2 ̆ 7 Guild in 1556 and in 1573 the now native-dominated guild issued an order banning strangers from the guild for ten years. Following shortly on the heels of that order, the City of London banned strangers from becoming members of London 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>guilds</b> and, by extension, from joining London 2 ̆ 7 s leadership. Together the Brewers 2 ̆ 7 Company and the City limited opportunities for strangers, which would lead to the trade becoming dominated by natives by 1600. Native brewers had cut out many of their competitors by 1600, but were vulnerable to other threats. The greatest threat to their existence across the seventeenth and early eighteenth century was taxation by the English state. Although an attempt to tax the industry failed in 1637, an excise tax on beer was introduced in 1643 and became the backbone of government excise revenues throughout the next two centuries. London brewers were forced to adapt to the excise. Some became quite successful, expanding their breweries and influence in local and national politics. Most, however, found that the extra burden of the excise made investing in the expansion of their breweries impossible. This situation became acute following the revolution of 1688 - 89 as the English state demanded ever more through the excise. Those demands exacerbated already existing tensions between smaller and larger brewers in the London community, which came to a head in the early eighteenth century as many smaller brewers were forced from the trade and their share of the market gobbled up by their larger competitors. Following the introduction of porter, a beer suited to industrialized production, to London around 1720, the last piece of the puzzle for the rise of the great industrial brewers, such as the Calverts and Thrales, was in place. What had been a trade that was once dominated by marginalized populations in the form of women and strangers was now controlled by an industrialized elite...|$|R

Autor dokazuje da je riječ o Geniju prosvjete, dosad nepoznatoj javnoj plastici kipara Hinka Juhna (Podgorač, 1891. —Zagreb, 1940.). U radu se otkriva ikonografija toga motiva i njegova geneza iz ideja prosvjetiteljstva te se navode sukladni francuski primjeri javne plastike. Komparativnom analizom uočavaju se formalne sličnosti, a potom i stilske razlike između Juhnove figure Djevojka s bakljom {{i figure}} Jugoslavija sa Spomenika palim Šumadincima u Kragujevcu Antuna Augustinčića iz 1932. godine. Utvrđuju se oblikovne karakteristike skulpture na južnom pročelju Gimnazije u Kušlanovoj i određuje njezino važno mjesto u okviru cjelokupnoga kiparskog opusa Hinka Juhna. On the {{southern}} {{facade of the}} Gymnasium in Kušlanova street {{at the height of}} nine metres stands a bronze statue of a girl bearing a torch,. It has not been known, until recently, who the author was, when the statue was put up or, indeed, why. The research has shown that the building was designed by the architect Egon Steinmann in 1934. It was under construction between 1935 and 1937, when the statue was placed on the southern facade as an Expressionist attribute, quite common in architecture at the time. Since no data has been found in any relevent sources about the author of the sculpture and the plaster east of the statue owned by the school has not been signed, the only way to find out who the author had been, was to reach the bronze sculpture itself. In February 2004. after climbing {{the side of the building}} to reach the statue, the author of this thesis found a signature of the Croatian sculptor, ceramist and pedagogue Hinko Juhn (born in Podgorač in 1891, died in Zagreb in 1940) on it. The iconographycal analysis of the statue has shown an affiliation with French sculptors from the 19. century such as Francoise Miche]-Pascal, Augustin Dumont, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Auguste Bartholdi (also with figure from unknown author in Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb), all of whom had used torch bearing female figures to symbolize the ideas of Enlighment. It is therefore safe to conclude that the bronze statue by Juhn erected upon the facade of the Gymnasium in Kušlanova street represents The Genius Of Enlighment. The comparative analysis which has been done with the statue called Jugoslavija, the central figure of the sculpture Memorial For The Fallen From Šumadija made by Antun Augstinčić in Kragujevac in 1932, shows certain similarities in sculptural forms between the two. Yet, in spite of those similarities, it is clearly visible that the two sculptures differ: while the expressive Realism of Augustinčić yields to monumentality, Juhn 2 ̆ 7 s Girl With A Torch exudes that soft and harmonious style of Secession and Art Deco. T he figure on the facade of the Gymnasium in Kušlanova street fits in well with the rest of Juhn 2 ̆ 7 s work both morphologically and conceptually, since in his ceramic and small plastic work he has been noted for, he often presented female water bearers, reapers and bathers holding distinctive objects. In his public plastic work he frequently depicted mythological and allegorical scenes, from Nereids and sea-nymphs to Amazons and allegorical aspects of pottery. His relief called Mason 2 ̆ 7 s And Potter 2 ̆ 7 s Trade, made in 1938 for Matica hrvatskih obrtnika (The Croatian Tradesmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Guild)</b> in Zagreb, was considered the biggest in size until the discovery of his twelfth public sculpture, which has proved that Girl With A Torch on the south side of the Gymnasium in Kušlanova street, is not only the biggest of Juhn 2 ̆ 7 s public plastic works but also his biggest sculpture in general. It is probably also well-worth noting that this is the fourth public sculpture by Hinko Juhn retained in its original form...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In December 1948, {{an article}} by Seamus Brady in The Manitoba Ensign claimed, “[The Catholic Stage Guild of Ireland] has {{branches}} in every city in Ireland, {{as well as in}} Britain, America and Australia. ” Its presence, according to Brady's article, was overwhelming. And yet by the 1970 <b>s,</b> the <b>Guild</b> mysteriously seemed to disappear altogether from Irish society. This popularity and disappearance formulated my dissertation's primary research question: how did the life of the Catholic Stage Guild of Ireland (its birth, success, and disappearance) reflect twentieth century Irish Catholicism and its relationship with the nation? This question encouraged numerous subsidiary questions including: how was the Guild as popular as Brady claims? And if it indeed was as Brady claims, then why did it extinguish? This dissertation seeks to uncover whether the Catholic Stage Guild of Ireland's seemingly short, but powerful years emulating the status and movements of Irish Catholicism in the twentieth century The Catholic Stage Guild of Ireland dramatically depicted the heartaches and successes of the Irish Catholics. Created by firm Catholics during a time in which the religion was celebrated, then altered, then slandered, the Catholic Stage Guild offers insight into individual attitudes concerning the state of the country and its primary religion. A study of the Catholic Stage Guild (which until now has not been conducted) will not only examine the history and purpose of this group of Catholic artists, but also falls in the foreground against the backdrop of twentieth century Ireland and provides insight into the movements of Irish Catholicism and nationalism during this time. Ultimately, this dissertation provides a historical context for Catholics to understand the relationship between Irish Catholicism, Irish nationalism and Irish theatre in the twentieth century, as well as provides non-Catholics with a sense of the importance of a Catholic Stage Guild in a time consumed by religious conflict...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} marine fish use coastal lagoons during {{early stages of}} their life cycles due to the {{protection}} provided by their turbid waters and complex structure of the environment, such as mangroves and mudflats, {{and the availability of}} food derived from the high productivity of these sites. In this study, we analyzed the diet of six species of juvenile marine fishes that use a karstic lagoon system in the northwest portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Through stomach contents analysis we determined the trophic differences among Caranx latus, Oligoplites saurus, Trachinotus falcatus, Synodus foetens, Lutjanus griseus, and Strongylura notata. C. latus, O. saurus, S. foetens, and S. notate, which are ichthyophagous species (> 80 % by number). L. griseus feeds mainly on crustaceans (> 55 %) and fish (35 %), while T. falcatus feeds on mollusks (> 50 % bivalves, > 35 % gastropods). The analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) showed differences in the diet of all species. Cluster analysis, based on the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix revealed three groups; one characterized by the ichthyophagous <b>guild</b> (<b>S.</b> notata, S. foetens, C. latus, and O. saurus), other group formed by the crustacean consumers (L. griseus), and the third, composed by the mollusk feeder (T. falcatus). Species of the ichthyophagous guild showed overlap in their diets, which under conditions of low prey abundance may trigger competition, hence affecting juvenile stages of these marine species that use coastal lagoons to feed and grow...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{community}} {{structure and}} the main environmental factors influencing community structure were studied using a database of fish population surveys and limnological information describing 144 Illinois lakes. Data were collected by Illinois Department of Conservation fisheries biologists in a standardized manner using electrofishing and gill nets. Population survey data were adjusted using equations estimating efficiency of the gears under varying conditions resulting in estimates of biomass and number of fish per hectare;Guild systems were {{used to describe the}} communities and to simplify the analysis of fish community data thus allowing for comparison of community structure between lakes of varying species compositions. I used Balon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> reproductive <b>guilds</b> and developed new guild systems based on selected life history characteristics. Data for these life history characteristics were taken from the literature and analyzed using cluster analysis and correspondence analysis. This resulted in guilds based on spawning characteristics, trophic position, and habitat utilization and combinations of each of these. Analysis of guild dynamics revealed that the number of guilds present in a lake increased with lake size. The number of species representing each guild increased with lake size in some guilds, but was unrelated in others;Eighteen environmental parameters were estimated for the 144 lakes including descriptors of water chemistry, lake morphometry, age, location in watershed, and growing season length. Using principal components analysis, the variables were summarized into four major factors: lake size, north-south gradient, depth, and percent of lake as littoral zone. When lakes were classified using hierarchical cluster analysis, 11 categories of lakes were described;Species richness was best correlated with lake surface area and, secondarily, with conductivity. There were significant differences in species richness among lake categories, but this was mainly attributed to lake size. Species rank-abundance curves showed differences in abundance patterns related to lake size. Equitability of species abundance was negatively related with lake size and species richness;Fish species abundance and biomass was related to environmental variables using canonical correspondence analysis. Lakes within the 11 categories exhibited characteristic fish communities. The lake size gradient indicated that large lakes contain characteristic guilds comprised of several species primarily associated with large rivers. The north-south gradient was important in separating a group of five more northerly species from the remaining 37 species. It is postulated that environmental factors act in a hierarchical manner in influencing fish communities. Large-scale processes (climate and geology), local processes (lake size, connectance, etc.), and in-lake processes (predation, competition, etc.) all act to modify the potential community at different levels and each must be accounted for when studying processes at the other levels...|$|R
40|$|With the {{exception}} of humans, gray wolves (Canis lupus) {{are perhaps the most}} significant predator of cervids in the northern hemisphere, mainly due to the group-hunting, year-round activity, and widespread geographic distribution (Peterson et al. 2003). Thus, interactions between wolves and large herbivore prey, such as elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces alces), have long been of interest to biologists (Peterson 1995, Jęodrzejewska et al. 2000, Mech and Boitani 2003). The potential ecological role this apex predator may have, via trophic cascades, has also received attention in recent years by researchers (e. g., Callan et al. 2013, Kuijper et al. 2013, 2014), wildlife management agencies (e. g., state wolf management plans), as well as the general public. Perhaps nowhere in the western United States has a heightened examination of this large predator been more focused than in Yellowstone National Park (YNP; Laundré et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2003, 2013, Fortin et al. 2005). Here, wolves were reintroduced in the mid- 1990 s, again completing the park 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> large predator <b>guild</b> after approximately seven decades of absence, thus providing a long-term, landscape-scale, natural experiment (Diamond 1983). The Gallatin winter range is one of two that occur along the northern portion of YNP, the other is the northern ungulate winter range, or “northern range,” located some 25 km or more to the east. Of these, the Gallatin has been less studied. Nevertheless, the Gallatin winter range, like the northern range, experienced high levels of elk herbivory following the extirpation of wolves in the early 1900 s. Over a period of approximately seven decades, intensive herbivory by elk led to the long-term decline in aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willow (Salix spp.) recruitment (i. e., growth of young plants above the browse level of elk) in the Gallatin winter range, leaving these plant communities in an impoverished condition (Lovaas 1967, Patten 1968, Kay 2001, Ripple and Beschta 2004, Halofsky and Ripple 2008). Accelerated soil and channel erosion also occurred (Lovaas 1967, Beschta and Ripple 2006). Thus, when wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone in the mid- 1990 s, aspen recruitment within the Gallatin elk winter range, had been largely absent for several decades (Kay 2001, Halofsky and Ripple 2008). In 2010, Winnie (2012) sampled 65 aspen stands in the northwestern corner of YNP, within the Gallatin elk winter range, to determine if a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade (BMTC) was occurring. As background information Winnie (2012 : 2600) included only a single sentence about wolves in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the remainder of the paragraph briefly discussed elk numbers, with most of the emphasis on elk in YNP 2 ̆ 7 s northern range where there has been a pronounced redistribution of elk since the reintroduction of wolves (White et al. 2012). A more complete summary regarding the status and dynamics of wolves and elk over the last 15 years (i. e., 1995 – 2010) in the Gallatin elk winter range, {{as well as in the}} Daly Creek sub-drainage where Winnie 2 ̆ 7 s study occurred, would have helped readers better understand the context of his study. Furthermore, information regarding human harvest of elk in the Gallatin winter range since the return of wolves, or whether such hunting has been affecting elk numbers or distribution in recent years was not provided. As part of his 2010 field study, Winnie (2012) characterized the presence or absence of several hypothesized risk factors (independent variables) for each aspen stand, including escape impediments, visual impediments, distance to conifer forest edge, and presence of deadfall trees. For dependent variables, Winnie (2012) recorded the presence or absence of browsing on aspen suckers (ramets 3 ̆c 2 m in height) and the number of aspen juveniles (plants 3 ̆e 2 m in height but 3 ̆c 6 cm in diameter at breast height). A height of 2 m generally represents the upper browse level of elk, and young aspen exceeding this height are considered to have successfully recruited. Such recruitment would represent a major departure from the browsing suppression that occurred in his study area over recent decades (Kay 2001, Halofsky and Ripple 2008) and an indication that a tri-trophic cascade involving wolves, elk, and aspen may be underway. From the results of his analyses, Winnie (2012 : 2600) concluded that “aspen were not responding to hypothesized fine-scale risk factors in ways consistent with the current BMTC hypothesis. ” We respectfully submit that the design and analysis used to support such a conclusion may be deficient for two reasons, the first based on conceptual concerns and the second on statistical concerns. (1) Unfortunately, some aspen stands Winnie (2012) sampled contained juveniles associated with “physical barriers,” barriers that could prevent elk from browsing young aspen. To be scientifically valid, a risk assessment using young aspen as the dependent variable must inherently assure that all evaluated plants were accessible to elk browsing. (2) The inclusion of 10 aspen stands containing some physically protected aspen likely confounded results from his predation risk analyses (i. e., Figs. 5, 6, and 7 in Winnie 2012). While the inclusion of stands with protected aspen may increase the variance associated with his dependent variables (i. e., browsing rate, number of juveniles), the fallacy of doing so is revealed by inspecting these variables for the 85...|$|R
