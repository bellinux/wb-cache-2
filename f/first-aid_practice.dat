40|$|Background: Burns {{represent}} one of {{the major}} health problems in India. Objective: To study some of the important epidemiological factors in relation to burn cases. Methods: Present study was retrospective study of all burn injury cases admitted hospital situated in rural area. The information obtained was tabulated analyzed using the software GraphPad Instat. Results: Overall female burn patients were significantly higher than male. Majority of female patients had total burn surface area more than 35 % whereas 48. 70 % of the male patients had a total burn surface area more than 35 % (Ï‡ 2 = 7. 99, p = 0. 005). Thermal burn was the commonest cause of burn followed by scalds. In majority of the patients (91. 8 %) burns were caused by flame occurred at home. Conclusion: Public education on safer <b>first-aid</b> <b>practices</b> and availability of good burn care facilities is necessary. </p...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{poisoning}} is {{a common}} presentation in paediatric practice and an important cause of preventable mortality and morbidity in Sri Lanka. The burden of plant poisoning is largely underexplored. The current multicenter study based in rural Sri Lanka assessed clinical profiles, poison related factors, clinical management, complications, outcomes, and risk factors associated with plant poisoning in the paediatric age group. Among 325 children, 57 % were male with 64 % being below five years of age. 99. 4 % had ingested the poison. Transfer rate was 66. 4 %. Most had unintentional poisoning. Commonest poison plant was Jatropha circus and poisoning event happened mostly in home garden. 29 % of parents <b>practiced</b> harmful <b>first-aid</b> <b>practices.</b> 32 % of children had delayed presentations to which the commonest reason was lack of parental concern regarding urgency of seeking medical care. Presence of poisonous plants in home garden was the strongest risk factor for plant poisoning. Mortality rate was 1. 2 % and all cases had Oleander poisoning. The study revealed the value of community awareness regarding risk factors and awareness among healthcare workers regarding the mostly benign nature of plant poisoning in children in view of limiting incidence of plant poisoning and reducing expenditure on patient management...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Abeokuta in 1890, Coquard {{was put in charge}} of medical work at the mission dispensary under the {{guidance}} of Fr. Justin François. But four days after Coquard’s arrival, he was left as the mission supervisor while François was traveling. He didn’t know the language, so patients and mission boys served as his interpreters. [...] With the exception of a five-week apprenticeship, Coquard was largely self-taught. Although he had received no formal medical training, he reportedly demonstrated an extraordinary interest and ability for medical work. [...] At the mission, there were no actual medical professionals, but they received permission from the Propaganda Fide for the clergy to perform surgery. Coquard quickly became much sought-after and beloved among the Egba people. In 1893, he was officially put in charge of the dispensary. He also sought to help the lepers who were forced to live outside the city. He and Father François wanted to build a more permanent home for them, a goal they worked toward for six years. Finally in 1897, the leprosarium was realized. Over the course of his time at the Abeokuta mission, Coquard wrote frequently to Le Petit Messager to gain support for various mission projects. He described the Egba people living in Abeokuta and stressed that often patients left the mission not only cured of illness but also converted. In response to his articles, European readers of the journal sent him medical equipment and books as well as church props such as altar cloths, etc. In his letters to the Messenger, Coquard focused on the difference Christianity could have on the children taken into the orphanage at the mission and encouraged the sponsoring of individual children. His primary goal, however, was building a hospital for the sick, the orphans, and the elderly. After spending some time at the mission, Coquard was convinced of the importance of his medical work for the mission, and he began advocating for the hospital despite the blatant lack of resources. He cited the expense of the time taken for long journeys to see patients who could not be accommodated due to lack of space at the mission and the fact that sometimes patients even had to sleep in the horse’s stable. The mission then began accepting payment for medical care at the request of one of the Egba chiefs who wanted to ensure that the Egba people would receive proper care. The funds were a considerable help since the mission was barely staying afloat, and the financial boost allowed Coquard’s hospital to be approved. Even with all the financial support from Europe as well, they still lacked the capital to actually complete the hospital. Coquard accordingly used a portion of the funds that were specifically designated for the leprosarium, for which he was criticized by many. The hospital was eventually completed in 1895. After the death of Father François in 1895, Coquard became the superior in Abeokuta. However, the following year when it became apparent that he wasn’t following certain restrictions, he was sent to South America to fundraise. He was angry about being forced out of his position, but he had every intention of returning. As for the actual fundraising work, he called it pitiable since the people he was requesting donations from were so poor. He came back with an idea as well as the funding for a Christian village. He used the new project as a way to ensure his continued position at the mission, and in 1902, he was named visitor, responsible for the spiritual welfare of the confreres. He began advocating for an addition to the leprosarium and for a newer hospital in 1903. His plans were for a grand two story hospital building. Bishop Lang found the layout including towers and terraces excessive and Bishop Paul Pellet ordered Coquard to only build a one story building, but Coquard began construction without their approval. The Egba government and the Egba people held him in high regard and supported the construction of the new hospital. Although Coquard’s strong personality often put him at odds with Society of African Missions leaders, Coquard’s labor and medical work culminated in the establishment of the Sacred Heart Hospital. On May 5, 1911 with the Alake, his court, and members of the government in attendance, the new Sacred Heart Hospital was opened by the governor of Lagos, Sir Walter Egerton, who had also laid the foundation stone in 1904. Since Coquard was getting older, they {{wanted to be able to}} ensure that the hospital would not collapse after his decease. The government promised to ensure the hospital’s future, and Coquard decided it would be best if the hospital was put under a doctor’s supervision immediately while he just continued with administration work. However, instead of the government continuing the hospital’s existence as initially planned, the Wuerzburg Institute ended up providing staff for the hospital. In 1917, orders from the Propaganda Fide prevented Coquard from even <b>practicing</b> <b>first-aid.</b> In his anger, Coquard wrote letters that were offensive to many high-standing mission leaders. Because Coquard had brought the mission into debt, repeatedly disobeyed Bishop Terrien’s orders and was now disrespecting his supervisors, many wanted him to be removed. In 1919, Coquard resigned from his position as superior of the Abeokuta mission. He was recalled to France, but the Egba people were outraged and petitioned for him to stay. In 1923, he tried to implement a nursing sisterhood since there were so many women, both young and old, who spent their lives working at the hospital but never earned a degree. This progressive idea of women’s education sadly was never realized. He did, however, open a school for midwives two years later that in 1998 became a general nursing school. In 1933, after many dedicated years of missionary service Coquard died in Abeokuta.|$|R
