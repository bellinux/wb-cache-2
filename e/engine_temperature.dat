25|$|The 1962 Valiant {{was given}} a {{completely}} new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round speedometer was placed at {{the left of the}} cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, <b>engine</b> <b>temperature,</b> and charging system condition (amperes) in a row {{to the right of the}} speedometer. Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|E

25|$|After his nominal 'retirement' he {{made two}} returns to Bathurst. In 2002 he paired with Team Brock lead driver Craig Baird to a 23rd-place {{finish in the}} teams VX Commodore, Brock {{finished}} 25 laps down due to <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> problems. He {{then returned to the}} Holden Racing team for the 2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000, teaming with Englishman Jason Plato in a VY Commodore. The pair failed to finish after Plato was involved in a spectacular accident coming out of Caltex Chase with the Ozemail Falcon of fellow BTCC regular (and Brock's 1993 Bathurst co-driver) John Cleland while Cleland was lapping the Commodore (which was limping to the pits with a blown tyre) on lap 29. The clash caused the Falcon to roll and enough damage to the HRT car to be out on the spot with Brock failing to get a drive in his last Bathurst race after Plato had started the car and was due to hand over to Brock a few laps after the crash.|$|E
25|$|Maricello {{was pushing}} hard but {{lost control of}} his car at the R Bend and {{collided}} heavily with the barriers. He retired from the race and this put pressure off Félix da Costa who made use of his situation {{to close the gap}} to Lynn. Sims was running strongly but backed off at about lap ten {{as a result of an}} <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor problem which he corrected by short shifting and pulling out off Derani's slipstream. Félix da Costa reduced the deficit to Lynn to just over one second with four laps left in the event. He got this gap down to 1.3 seconds under yellow flag conditions for Wolf's stranded car at Lisboa corner, but was unable to get close to affect an pass on Lynn who maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to win. Lynn became the seventh driver to have won the Macau Grand Prix for Theodore Racing. The previous year's winner Félix da Costa finished second, 1.173 seconds in arrears, while Derani completed the podium in third place. Off the podium, Sims finished in fourth position. King led Carlin teammates Jaafar and Sainz in the next three places. Blomqvist came from the back of the field to finish eighth with Latifi ninth. Ocon recovered from his race start stall to complete the top ten. Outside the top ten, Sekiguchi was eleventh and led fellow countryman Nakayama in twelfth. The British pairing of Buller and Tincknell followed in 13th and 14th with Chiyo, Giovinazzi, Mason, Van der Laar, Jones, Wolf and Korjus the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was likewise {{a standard}} rectangular section wooden girder structure, fabric covered except around {{the engine and}} a wood upper decking around the open, tandem cockpits for pilot and for the observer, who sat under the wing trailing edge. It tapered to a knife-edge at the tail. At the front the [...] Mercedes water-cooled upright inline engine was enclosed in a rectangular cross-section metal cowling which tapered vertically, exposing the upper cylinders, to a two blade propeller. At {{the rear of the}} housing an external radiator, with shutters for <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> control, projected on each side. The Schoettler had a conventional fixed undercarriage, with the mainwheels on a rigid axle mounted on V-struts.|$|E

50|$|The M20K was {{marketed as}} the Mooney 231. This models Continental TSI0-360-GB engine {{required}} specific pilot training and modified takeoff and climb procedures {{to operate at}} acceptable <b>engine</b> <b>temperatures</b> in hot weather, so by 1986, it was replaced with an intercooled TSIO-360-MB <b>engine,</b> reducing the <b>temperature</b> problems and achieving {{a top speed of}} 252 mi/h km/h in level flight (at FL 280). This subvariant of the M20K was marketed as the Mooney 252.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike a piston engine, {{in which}} the {{cylinder}} is heated by the combustion process and then cooled by the incoming charge, Wankel rotor housings are constantly heated {{on one side and}} cooled on the other, leading to high local temperatures and unequal thermal expansion. While this places great demands on the materials used, the simplicity of the Wankel makes it easier to use alternative materials, such as exotic alloys and ceramics. With water cooling in a radial or axial flow direction, and the hot water from the hot bow heating the cold bow, the thermal expansion remains tolerable. Top <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> has been reduced to , with a maximum temperature difference between engine parts of [...] by the use of heat pipes around the housing and in side plates as a cooling means.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. [...] Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> in the optimum range.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1917, the Sopwith chief engineer, Herbert Smith, began {{designing}} a new fighter (internal Sopwith designation 5F.1) {{powered by the}} geared 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8B. The resulting Dolphin was a two-bay, single-seat biplane, with the upper wings attached to an open steel cabane frame above the cockpit. To maintain the correct centre of gravity, the lower wings were positioned [...] forward of the upper wings, creating the Dolphin’s distinctive negative wing stagger. The pilot sat with his head through the frame, where he had an excellent view. This configuration sometimes caused difficulty for novices, who {{found it difficult to}} keep the aircraft pointed at the horizon because the nose was not visible from the cockpit. The cockpit was nevertheless warm and comfortable, in part because pipes ran alongside the cockpit walls to the two side-mounted radiator blocks. Shutters in front of each radiator core allowed the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> to be controlled.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{one of the}} {{assumptions}} listed below adds {{to the complexity of}} the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing [...] "reasonable" [...] results. At {{the upper end of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges (e.g. combustor sections – 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to plasma). Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different thermodynamic processes by adjusting the equation to read pVn = constant and then varying the n through different values such as the specific heat ratio, γ.|$|E
2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the engine housing has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of engine. The [...] "heat pipes" [...] effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, with resulting decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> from 231°C to 129°C, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of engine from 159°C to 18°C.|$|E
