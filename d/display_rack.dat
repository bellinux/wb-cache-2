5000|$|In {{the most}} basic form of the game, the turn-holding player asks any other player {{if he has a}} {{particular}} letter of the alphabet hidden on his <b>display</b> <b>rack.</b> If the answer is [...] "no", play simply passes to the next player in sequence. Otherwise, the player turns up any one card showing that letter, and play continues for the turn-holder, who may address another question to the same player or switch to a different player. His turn ends when he finally gets a [...] "no" [...] answer. If any cards were turned up, the point values underneath them are added to turn-holder's score. If any were the last card of a word, a 50-point bonus is added. If the turn ended by asking for a blank (and hearing [...] "no"), a 50-point penalty is assessed.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} game set {{includes four}} plastic display racks and four decks of 96 cards. Each card has either one letter or a blank on it. Each deck has 5 each of A, S, blank; 3 each of B, H, P, W, Y; 2 each of J, Q, V, X, Z; and 4 each {{of all the}} other letters. Each <b>display</b> <b>rack</b> can hold up to twelve cards, with a point value assigned to each card position: 5-10-15-15-10-5-5-10-15-15-10-5. The cards are used to spell out each player's secret word face-down on one of the racks. For words less than 12 letters, blank cards may be used at one or both ends of the word to disguise its true length. Game version #202, introduced in 1976, replaces the letter cards with strips of paper on which the letters are written, and doors snap into place to cover them.|$|E

During his childhood, Dux and a group of friends broke into Tanaka's home to steal a katana, but Dux was apprehended by the Tanakas while attempting to return the katana to its <b>display</b> <b>rack.</b> Impressed by Dux's honesty and lack of fear, Senzo trained him together with Shingo in martial arts.

Dux goes absent without a leave, saying goodbye to his mentor and leaving for Hong Kong.

The next semester's class investigated the effects of replacing specified quantities of aggregate with granulated plastics in air-entrained concrete. The students helped prepare concrete specimens for compression, flexure, and freeze-thaw tests that were conducted by commercial testing facilities. Each semester the students had to analyze the data from the tests and present their findings to management...|$|R

Shaw placed {{a series of}} {{newspaper}} ads, publicizing this price and asserting that his Grey Gull Records were [...] "Better than 75-cent records...much better" [...] (ad in the Philadelphia Inquirer, 10 September 1922, p. 6).

Grey Gull would place <b>display</b> <b>racks</b> offering their latest product in newsstands, cigar stores, drug stores, and other well-frequented businesses, returning {{on a regular basis}} to restock the racks and settle accounts with the merchant, a system known today as rack jobbing.

A good example of Shaw's strategy of placing the racks {{in a wide variety of}} locations can be seen in an ad for Ruth's Drug Store in Elyria, Ohio. The druggist, Dr. Robert J.

I wonder if he knew this invention of his own creation would have such an impact on the human race. Johann Gutenberg’s printing press replaced the teams of monks within the following decades and with it a steady supply of books which would be used by billions of people, if modern day readers are included.
