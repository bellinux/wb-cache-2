50|$|Eddie {{recruited}} his cousin, Sam E. Antar (known as Sammy), {{to assist}} the company with its fraud. Sammy {{earned a degree in}} accounting in 1980, and served his apprenticeship with Penn and Horowitz, Crazy Eddie's auditor. In 1986, he was named chief financial officer of the company. Sammy was informed that there was a $3 million deficit from the previous year's inventory fraud that needed to be hidden. Additionally, he was instructed to find ways to show a 10% growth in sales. One of Sammy's major schemes was a money laundering operation later known as the Panama Pump â€” money that the Antars had deposited in Israeli banks was transferred to bank accounts in Panama. These accounts, opened using <b>false</b> names, then <b>drafted</b> payments to Crazy Eddie. This money was largely used to inflate same-store sales totals for the company.|$|R
