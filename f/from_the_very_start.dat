Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort {{for the rest of the}} century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>start,</b> the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves of arrows in 1568, for example, probably for use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again probably for use by the militia.|$|E

25|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>start</b> of his {{professional}} practice as an architect Dyson sought to demonstrate architecture as a force for community good, particularly in an unpublicized commitment to bring professional architectural services to {{the causes of the}} culturally disadvantaged.

In 1971, Dyson developed two schemes for a publicly subsidized children’s center constructed in Orange Cove, California that combined both a Head Start and day care operation. By serving at this same time as chairman of the Urban Planning Task Force in Fresno, Dyson commenced a lifelong journey in public service.

In Kolkata, for example, {{it was observed}} in the 1960s that egg depositing containers were being settled by the Asian tiger mosquito in city districts where the malaria mosquito (genus Anopheles) and yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) had both been eliminated by the application of DDT. This may be because primarily the inner walls of the houses were treated with DDT to kill the mosquitoes resting there and fight the malaria mosquito. The yellow fever mosquito also lingers particularly in the inside of buildings {{and would have been}} also affected. The Asian tiger mosquito rests in the vicinity of human dwellings would therefore have an advantage over the other two species. In other cases, where the yellow fever mosquito was repressed by the Asian tiger mosquito, for instance in Florida, this explanation does not fit. Other hypotheses include competition in the larval breeding waters, differences in metabolism and reproductive biology, or a major susceptibility to sporozoans (Apicomplexa).|$|E

Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>start</b> of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

Structural integrity of individual ectodomain modules in these receptors depends on calcium, and we showed before that the LDL receptor folds its modules late after synthesis via intermediates with abundant non-native disulfide bonds and structure. Using a radioactive pulse-chase approach, we here show that for proper LDL receptor folding, calcium had to be present <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> early <b>start</b> of folding, which suggests at least some native, essential coordination of calcium ions at the still largely non-native folding phase.

Coevolution of protein folding with the high calcium concentration in the ER may be the basis for the need for this cation throughout the folding process even though calcium is only stably integrated in native repeats at a later stag...|$|R
