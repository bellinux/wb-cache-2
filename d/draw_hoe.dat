5000|$|A <b>draw</b> <b>hoe</b> has a blade set at {{approximately}} {{a right angle}} to the shaft. The user chops {{into the ground and}} then pulls (draws) the blade towards them. Altering the angle of the handle can cause the hoe to dig deeper or more shallowly as the hoe is pulled. A <b>draw</b> <b>hoe</b> can easily be used to cultivate soil to a depth of several inches. A typical design of <b>draw</b> <b>hoe,</b> the [...] "eye hoe", has a ring in the head through which the handle is fitted. This design has been used since Roman times.|$|E

The daughter of Munro would <b>draw</b> his water, <b>hoe</b> his corn, and cook his venison. The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil." ...|$|R
5000|$|The ridging hoe, {{also known}} as the Warren hoe and the drill hoe, is a {{triangular}} (point-down) or heart-shaped <b>draw</b> <b>hoe</b> that is particularly useful for digging narrow furrows ("drills") and shallow trenches for the planting of seeds or bulbs.|$|E
5000|$|The hoop hoe, {{also known}} as the [...] "action hoe", oscillating, hula, stirrup, {{pendulum}} weeder, or [...] "swivel hoe") has a double-edge blade that bends around to form a rectangle attached to the shaft. Weeds are cut just {{below the surface of the}} soil as the blade is pushed and pulled. The back and forth motion is highly effective at cutting weeds in loose or friable soil. The width of the blade typically ranges between 3-7 inches. The head is a loop of flat, sharpened strap metal. However, it is not as efficient as a <b>draw</b> <b>hoe</b> for moving soil.|$|E
