The re-sults, based on a sample of hospitals from Jeddah and Taif cities, give some in-sights into the overall <b>working</b> <b>of</b> hospitals and the comparative working be-tween government and private hospitals. On the basis of all hospitals combined it is found that generally maintenance staff have formal vocational qualifica-tions and are provided training facilities. The <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> includes both preventive and breakdown maintenance and is fairly well developed. Mainte-nance facilities are of standard nature and various maintenance reports are pre-pared. Most of the hospitals have maintenance planning and control offices. The more serious problems faced are nonavailability of spares, shortage of technical manpower and lack of funds. On a comparative basis, government hospitals employ more maintenance staff, have better training facilities, do more preventive maintenance, have a more organized <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and prepare more maintenance reports. 1...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages <b>of</b> a shift <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> compared with the conventional on call system for preregistration house officers. DESIGN [...] A shift <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> was employed in the unit from 1 August 1989 to 31 July 1990. During attachments of three or six months four house officers rotated at intervals of one month among three daytime shifts and one night shift (Mondays to Fridays only). Weekends (48 hours) were worked on a one in three rota by the doctors working a day shift. The views of the house officers working this shift system were sought in writing and by direct interview. SETTING [...] Professorial surgical unit, Royal Liverpool Hospital. SUBJECTS [...] The 14 house officers who were attached to the unit for three or six months during their preregistration year. RESULTS [...] The shift system was preferred to conventional on call without exception. The incidence of chronic tiredness was reduced and formal hand-over between shifts resulted in more informed decision making by doctors while on call. During annual leave it was sometimes necessary to revert to the conventional one in three on call system to ensure that daytime work was completed. Other disadvantages were the long weekend shift and an inequitable distribution of the night shift. The house officers recommended extending the shifts to weekends and working the night shift one week in four. CONCLUSION [...] A shift <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> was effective in reducing chronic tiredness among house officers, who found it preferable to conventional on call arrangements. Shift working is feasible only if the daytime duties <b>of</b> the doctor <b>working</b> at night can be completed by the other doctors on the rota...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the complex}} {{structure}} <b>of</b> grader <b>working</b> device, its optimization is a repeated, continuously improved process. A new model has {{to be set up}} before each optimization. In order {{to solve the problem of}} repeating modeling and improve the product optimization efficiency, a second development <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> device is established. Parametric driving about working device is realized in term of spatial mechanism. At first, the overall design framework of this second development system was established, then customized user interface was completed based on UG/Open API and parametric programs about the working device system were complied based on UG/Open Grip subsequently. The connection among customized user interface, parametric programs and human-computer interaction was realized by using Visual C++, the integrated second development <b>system</b> design <b>of</b> <b>working</b> device was eventually completed. This second development system could not only provide engineers with a rapid design method to shorten the new product development cycle, but solve the problem of repeating modeling during optimization design as well...|$|R

The demands on the SRF system and RF control are substantial and a new design, based on waveguide damping, is currently being developed. This system will be used for a major upgrade of the BESSY II facility to the BESSY Variable Pulse length Storage Ring BESSY VSR for a next generation storage ring light source.
