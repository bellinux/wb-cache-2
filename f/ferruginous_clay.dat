50|$|The Bear Cross pub {{was put up}} in 1931-2, {{replacing}} a previous hostelry which had variously been known as 'The Bear Cross Inn' or 'The Brickmaker’s Arms'. The first licensee of this earlier hostelry, George Ware, worked as a brickmaker by day, as did most local inhabitants, as the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clays</b> of the area had {{given rise to a}} flourishing brickmaking industry by the mid-nineteenth century. On Ware's death in 1883 the inn's licence passed to the Lane family, among them Frank Lane, who worked as a carpenter by day and built coffins for the Gypsy community on nearby Alderney Common. His son Arthur Lane was born above The Bear Cross Inn in 1913, and could recall Augustus John - who lived at Alderney Manor between 1911 and 1927 - spending 'rumbustious' evenings on the premises, plus similar evenings at The Shoulder of Mutton in West Howe.|$|R

This last technique allowed to detect availability of iron species in oxidic environment with different structural complexity and to determine active sites, accessible for arsenate(V) adsorption. The effect was observed through temperature dependence of the first Fe(III) reduction step (below 570 ˚C) of iron-oxide species. The sequence of reducibility: ferrihydrite > hydrous oxide (goethite) > anhydrous oxide (hematite) > structural iron in clay was in agreement with the availability of iron active sites for the reducing process {{as well as for the}} arsenate adsorption. The important role of very high iron content in original samples was also observed. The chemical activation of iron-poor clay by a simple and feasible modification with Fe(III) solutions promoted the deposition of the ferrihydrite active phase with an increase of 2. 81 % (expressed as Fe 2 O 3) respect to the original content of 1. 07 %, constituting an accessible and eco-friendly technological alternative to solve the environmental problem of water containing arsenic...|$|R
5000|$|The Vindhyans {{are known}} to have a {{monotonous}} composition over extremely large areas and lateral sedimentological variations are but few. This fact was also noted by Medlicott and that despite this there are variations at some places. Quoting him (1860, p. 142):” ….its most marked characteristic certainly is the persistency of this lithological aspect over great areas. This sameness of texture is strongly in contrast with the prevailing character of all those more recent sandstone formations to the south……” And further, “This general constancy in lithological character does not, of course, imply the entire absence of varieties among the beds of the series : instead of clear quartz grits slightly earthy sandstones are found, and in many places <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clay</b> has been so strongly accumulated as to form a considerable ingredient in the mass.” Regarding the subhorizontality of the Vindhyans, Medlicott remarked (1860, p. 141),” …that a slight undulating dip is the rule, so slight as to leave most commonly an impression of general horizontality, in spite of great disturbances which have locally affected the rocks along their southern boundary.” ...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of fossil oil within clay minerals i. e., mineral-catalyzed decarboxylation, is a mechanism awaiting a thorough chemical explanation. To contribute {{to such an}} explanation, the study presented here investigates this mechanism {{at the level of}} first-principles, electronic structure computations, employing density functional theory (DFT plus Hubbard-U), planewaves, pseudopotentials, and periodic cells of two types of <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals, specifically two types of nontronite [Fe 2 (Si,Al) 4 O 10 (OH) 2]. The {{formation of}} the fossil oil is modeled as a decarboxylation pathway, converting the fatty acid propionic acid, C 2 H 5 COOH to an alkane, C 2 H 6 and the intermediate stages along this conversion pathway are represented by five configurations of interlayer species within the clay minerals. In this study, we test both the effect of the presence of iron on the theoretical stages of decarboxylation, together with the effect of two different density functionals: with and without strong correlations of the d-orbital electrons of iron. We have found that inclusion of the d-orbital electron correlations {{in the guise of a}} Hubbard parameter results in the introduction of three new intermediate configurations (one of which is potentially a new transition state), alters the location of the occupied Fermi level orbitals, and changes the band gaps of the clay mineral/interlayer species composites, all of which serves to inform the chemical interpretation of mineral-catalyzed decarboxylation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Gabbroic saprolite at Mont Mrgantic, Quebec, was {{studied in}} detail mineralogically {{to gain a}} better {{understanding}} ofthe origin of ferruginous smectite reported previously from these rocks. The parent rock is a ferrogabbro composed of plagioclase, augite, calc-alkalic amphiboles, biotite, olivine, magnetite, ilmenite, and apatite. Extensive weathering has decomposed most of the mafic minerals and magnetite to goethite, lepidocrocite, and iron-rich clay minerals, which occur in numerous microcracks distributed irregularly in the outer shells of boulders and in cracks and fissures in the bedrock. Some of the felsic minerals have altered to kaolinite. The secondary minerals and the more resistant primary minerals, such as plagioclase, ilmenite, and apatite, have subsequently moved to the lower part of the saprolite. The major <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals present are smectite and vermiculite, which are compositionally similar, except hat the smectite is slightly richer in SiO 2 and MgO and poorer in Fe 203 than the vermiculite. To establish a structural formula for the ferruginous mectite, the oxidation state of Fe in a sample treated with dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate was examined by Miissbauer spectroscopy. All structural iron was found to be ferric. The calculated structural formula of a Na-saturated sample is: Nao. 61 (Mg~. 39 Fe 3 +o. ssAlo. 17 Mno. 03) (Si 3. 49 Alo. 51) 0 re(OH) 2, which has a total octahedrai population of 2. 44.

5000|$|One of {{the notable}} places of {{interest}} is the Coloured Earths, which is about 4 km to the south west of the town. Coloured Earths is a phenomenon resulting from colour variations due to cooling of molten rock. The lava formations {{are estimated to be}} of 3.5 to 7 million years in age. These are heaps of exposed earth's crust which show up in seven colours when the sun light falls on them. Viewing them in the morning hours when sun rays and the dew mingle bring out the best of its colours. A closer view is better than the views from the timber platforms and walkways erected for the purpose. [...] The colour earth phenomenon is located downstream of the water fall on the Black River valley where the land is barren and plain which measures about 7 - 8 acre with hardly any vegetation. It gives the appearance of furrows in rows, as colors are observed in horizontal ridges known as [...] "Les Cotes de Melon" [...] ("The Melon's Slices"). An examination of the ground condition where the colours of different shades, varying from [...] "yellow and yellowish brown to bright red, purple, and coal black" [...] indicates about forty hues. The samples collected from this area have been subject to chemical analysis which reveal that the formation consists of cohesive formation of <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clays</b> without any organic matter, and devoid or with least presence of any principal elements of soil fertility.

40|$|Herein is {{reported}} a {{comparative study of}} the behaviour of four types of smectite clay minerals, mainly two poor iron bearing ones, SHCa- 1 (hectorite from San Bernadino, California), SWy- 1 (montmorillonite from Wyoming) and two ferruginous nontronites NG- 1 (from Hohen Hagen, Germany) and SWa- 1 (Grant County, Washington). The iron (III) exchange {{has been found to}} follow the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the clays. This exchange has also been found to have no effect on the stability and the structure of the iron poor clay minerals while it has a slight effect on the crystallinity of the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>clays</b> and on their thermal stability. The intercalation {{has been found to be}} dependent on the expansibility of the clays, increasing from the nontronites (dioctahedral iron rich clays), to the montmorillonite (dioctahedral iron less rich clay) to hectorite (trioctahedral iron poor clay). This intercalation treatment has been found to have a slight effect on both the structure of the iron poor clays and their thermal stability. In contrast, the ferruginous ones undergo a dramatic change in both their structure and their thermal stability. The transition temperature to hematite occurred at 350 °C as shown by an exotherm on the DSC curve of all the pillared materials. Furthermore the importance of iron oxyhydroxide and oxide phases formed were also found in both procedures to be dependent on the initial structural iron contents of the clays. We found that SH-modified SCa- 3 and in SWa- 1 have higher affinity for the metal ions than the SH-modified SWy- 1 and in SHCa- 1, because the pH of their solution is less acidic than those of SH-SWy- 1 and SH-SHCa- 1. All the adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir model and the adsorbents could be easily regenerated by leaching out the metal with 0. 1 N HCl. Moreover, the adsorption study has shown a considerably higher affinity of the SH-clays towards Cd 2 +, Zn 2 +, than the iron modified clays (intercalated and pillared at 350 °C and 600 °C), the Na-clays, and the pure hematite. The competitive adsorption of the divalent metal cations showed a strong affinity of all the SH-clays for Cu 2 + than for the Zn 2 + and Cd 2 +, due to the low pH of the mixture solution which is equal to that of the Cu solution.

40|$|Experimental batch and miscible-flow {{cultures}} {{were studied}} {{in order to}} determine the mechanistic pathways of microbial Fe(III) respiration in <b>ferruginous</b> smectite <b>clay,</b> NAu- 1. The primary purpose was to resolve if alteration of smectite and release of Fe precedes microbial respiration. Alteration of NAu- 1, represented by the morphological and mineralogical changes, occurred regardless of the extent of microbial Fe(III) reduction in all of our experimental systems, including those that contained heat-killed bacteria and those in which O 2, rather than Fe(III), was the primary terminal electron acceptor. The solid alteration products observed under transmission electron microscopy included poorly crystalline smectite with diffuse electron diffraction signals, discrete grains of Fe-free amorphous aluminosilicate with increased Al/Si ratio, Fe-rich grains, and amorphous Si globules in the immediate vicinity of bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances. In reducing systems, Fe was also found as siderite. The small amount of Fe partitioned to the aqueous phase was primarily in the form of dissolved Fe(III) species even in the systems in which Fe(III) was the primary terminal electron acceptor for microbial respiration. From these observations, we conclude that microbial respiration of Fe(III) in our laboratory systems proceeded through the following: (1) alteration of NAu- 1 and concurrent release of Fe(III) from the octahedral sheets of NAu- 1; and (2) subsequent microbial respiration of Fe(III) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} deposits that {{we analyzed}} from Leg 70 {{are composed of}} <b>ferruginous</b> green <b>clays</b> and fragments of manganese-hydroxide crust. Data from X-ray diffraction, IR-spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and chemical analyses indicate that the hydrothermal green clays are composed of disordered mixed-layer phases of celadonite-nontronite. Electron diffraction shows that {{the parameters of the}} unit cells and the degree of three-dimensional ordering of mixed-layer phases with 80 % celadonite interlayers are very close to Fe-micas of polymorphic modification IM-celadonite. In some sections, there is a tendency for the number of celadonite layers to increase with depth. The manganese-hydroxide crust fragments are predominantly composed of todorokite (buserite). An essential feature of hydrothermal accumulation is the sharp separation of Fe and Mn. Ba/Ti and Ba/Sr ratios are typical indicators of hydrothermal deposits. Sediments composing the hydrothermal mounds were deposited from moderately heated waters, which had extracted the components from solid basalts in environments where there were considerable gradients of temperature, eH, and pH. The main masses of Fe and Mn were deposited in the late Pleistocene. Postsedimentary alteration of deposited hydrothermal sediments led to their slight recrystallization and, in the green clays, to celadonitization. Further, factor analysis (by Varentsov) of chemical components from these hydrothermal deposits revealed paragenetic assemblages. Green clays corresponding to a definite factor assemblage were formed during the main stage of hydrothermal mineral formation. Manganese hydroxide and associated components were largely accumulated during an early stage {{and at the end of}} the main stage...|$|R

Interpretation {{of these data}} sets allows the internal geometry of the Mentelle Basin fill and depositional history to be reanalysed with {{a greater degree of}} confidence. Basin stratigraphy can be subdivided into several seismically defined megasequences, separated by major unconformities related to both the Valanginian breakup between India-Madagascar and Australia-Antarctica, and tectonically-driven switches in deposition through the Albian.

These have previously been interpreted as volcanic edifices, although direct evidence of volcanic feeder systems is lacking. An alternative interpretation is that these features may be carbonate build-ups. The latter interpretation carries significant climatic ramifications, since carbonate build-ups would have formed at high palaeolatitude, ~ 60 ° S. Soon after breakup, initial subsidence resulted in a shallow marine environment and Barremian-Aptian silty-sandy mudstones were deposited.

This was accompanied by Turonian-Santonian deposition of massive chalk beds, which are unconformably overlain by pelagic Palaeocene-Holocene sediments.

For most geologic materials the relative dielectric constant lies within the range of 3 - 30, with dry sand at the lower end of this range at about 3 - 5. Nonmetallic landmines have a dielectric constant range of 3. 2 - 9. 8 whereas metallic landmines have a much higher relative dielectric constant.
