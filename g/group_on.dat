Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third <b>group</b> <b>on</b> the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this <b>group</b> <b>on</b> the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

The elements of the {{alternating group}}, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the Alder-Stein principle has no bearing on the relative orientation of <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> the two starting materials.

The Alder-Stein principle is only consistent across the self-same starting materials. The relationship is only valid for the <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> the diene alone, or the <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> the dienophile, alone. The relative orientation of groups between the two reactants can be predicted by the endo selection rule.|$|R
