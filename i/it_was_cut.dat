5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> {{short by}} Roosevelt's {{desire to have}} him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} where the Simpsons' house {{transforms}} into numerous objects, {{one of the original}} designs included the house made entirely of squirrels. The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but ultimately <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut.</b> To ensure their work did not go to waste, some staff members have used the drawings on Christmas cards and other studio-related notices.|$|E
5|$|Next, Tatanka {{defeated}} The Berzerker by pinfall. This {{match was}} originally scheduled {{as part of}} the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes.|$|E

5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a foothold in the growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{grave in}} Abney Park was {{eventually}} surmounted by a memorial stone for Reed's {{family in the}} style of a Celtic cross, reflecting their connections to Ireland. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> by the O'Shea brothers' firm. Reed's biographer, the printing executive and historian Stanley Morison, suggests that Reed's legacy is his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, while Jack Cox, historian of the B.O.P, asserts that the school stories first serialised in the magazine are the writer's true memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E

5|$|Due in {{no small}} part to the {{presence}} of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham. Traffic on the B and its various branch lines, though, decreased after World War I. In 1919, Agricultural Branch trains were cut to Framingham, requiring a transfer to continue Boston or Mansfield. The line was cut back to Marlborough in 1931, and passenger service ended in 1937. Passenger service on the Mansfield & Framingham ended in 1933. The Milford Branch lasted the longest of the Boston & Albany branch lines; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> to one daily trip in 1953 and terminated in April 1959.|$|E
5|$|Formby took a {{break from}} work until mid-1954, when he starred in the revue Turned Out Nice Again, in Blackpool. Although the show was {{initially}} scheduled to run for 13 weeks, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> short after six when Formby suffered again from dysentery and depression. He again announced his retirement, but continued to work. After some television appearances on Ask Pickles and Top of the Town, in late 1954 and early 1955 respectively, Formby travelled to South Africa for a tour, where Beryl negotiated {{an agreement with the}} South African premier Johannes Strijdom to play in venues of Formby's choice, and then sailed to Canada for a ten-day series of performances. On the return voyage he contracted bronchial pneumonia, but still joined the cast of the non-musical play Too Young to Marry on his arrival in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded {{carriage}} carrying Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) and his fiancee, Abigail (Anastasia Griffith), is halted by a roadblock. Charming {{notices a}} fallen tree is blocking the road, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring. Charming pursues and knocks the mysterious thief off their horse. He discovers it is a woman, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Before {{he can get}} an answer as to why she stole his bag, Snow hits him with a rock, surprising and cutting him to make her escape. Charming vows that he will find her.|$|E

5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> back on its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out until she had given up on him. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{northern}} terminus of NY420 was in {{the center}} of Massena at the junction of Orvis and Main Streets, where it ended at NY37. In the mid-1950s, construction began on a new alignment for NY37 around the southern edge of the village. The highway opened to traffic by 1958; however, NY420 continued to extend past the bypass into Massena until the early 1960s, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> back to its junction with NY37's new routing. The former routing of NY420 in Massena is still state-maintained as part of NY970B, an unsigned reference route designation for all of Main Street between NY37 and NY37B.|$|E

5|$|This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it {{had sold}} 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 {{computers}} were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. When sales fell {{in the wake of}} the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre-assembled version to £49.95 in May 1982. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> by another £10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold.|$|E
5|$|According to Johnson, filming did {{not begin}} until April 1965, one year after {{approval}} of the script, with J. Hoberman reporting a slightly earlier date of September 1964 {{for the start of}} filming in his film essay for the Criterion collection release of the film. The initial budget was 1.6million Rubles, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> several times to one million Rubles (In comparison, Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace had a budget of eight and half million Rubles). As a result of the budget restrictions several scenes from the script were cut, including an opening scene showing the Battle of Kulikovo. Other scenes that were cut from the script are a hunting scene, where the younger brother of the Grand Prince hunts swans, and a scene showing peasants helping Durochka giving birth to her Russian-Tatar child. In the end the film cost 1.3million Rubles, with the cost overrun due to heavy snowfall, which disrupted shooting from November 1965 until April 1966. The film was shot on location, on the Nerl River and the historical places of Vladimir/Suzdal, Pskov, Izborsk and Pechory.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, Lafontaine {{ordered a}} retreat and Guderian finally got heavy {{artillery}} from the Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment. The 88mm dual role artillery guns and the heavier Panzer III and IVs reached {{the area of}} the battle. By this time, the French 7th Tank Battalion had been wiped out and the 213th Infantry Regiment had been devastated. Only 10 French tanks, out of 40, remained. In the two pitched battles the 7th Tank Battalion fought that day they lost 10 from 13. Delays on the right flank meant the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion did not reach their starting line until 10:45, by which time the battle on the left wing had been lost and further attacks on the right would have made little sense. The 1st Panzer Division's victory parade was held in Chemery at 12:00, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> short when the Luftwaffe bombed the square by mistake inflicting a few casualties.|$|E
