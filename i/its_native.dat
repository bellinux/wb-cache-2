5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>its</b> <b>native</b> area, A. ceciliae {{has also}} been {{reported}} from Asia. These regions include Japan, Azad Kashmir and Iran. There is speculation that North American collections could possibly be an undescribed species differing from the European A.ceciliae.|$|E

5|$|N.californiensis {{is used as}} fishing bait, and is {{frequently}} transported alive between U.S. states, prompting fears that existing population structure may be obliterated, {{and that it could}} introduce the castrating parasitic isopod Ione cornuta outside <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range.|$|E
5|$|Outside <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, emerald ash borer is an {{invasive}} species {{that is highly}} destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. Prior to emerald ash borer being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range aside from a short description of life-history traits and taxonomic descriptions, which resulted in focused research on its biology in North America. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s and its subsequent detection in 2002 in Canton, Michigan, it has since spread {{other parts of the}} North America. It is suspected that it was introduced from overseas in shipping materials such as packing crates.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E
5|$|Zodiac was {{the first}} {{production}} to employ the Filmstream camera in <b>its</b> <b>native</b> Filmstream mode, which records an uncompressed video stream, allowing for exceptional quality.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending <b>its</b> <b>native</b> soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E

5|$|In <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, emerald ash borer {{is only a}} {{nuisance}} pest on native trees, as population densities typically do not reach levels lethal to healthy trees. In China, it infests native F. chinensis, F. mandshurica, and F. rhynchophylla; in Japan it also infests F. japonica and F. lanuginosa.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{classified}} as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt classification, meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur. It rarely occurs in <b>its</b> <b>native,</b> metallic form. Many lead minerals are relatively light and, {{over the course of}} the Earth's history, have remained in the crust instead of sinking deeper into the Earth's interior. This accounts for lead's relatively high crustal abundance of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most abundant element in the crust.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{has contributed}} to American arts and culture. Drawing from <b>its</b> <b>Native</b> American and Yankee roots, along with later {{immigrant}} groups, Massachusetts has produced a number of writers, artists, and musicians.

5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E
5|$|Outside <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, F.rubiginosa has naturalised to {{some degree}} in urban Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, as well as New Zealand, Hawaii and California, and Mediterranean Europe. F. rubiginosa has been planted widely in Malta since the early 1990s but has not been {{observed}} to fruit.|$|E
5|$|Since 1994, the Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single push-up design into a full-range lingerie fashion label {{in most of}} the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal.

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has been {{introduced}} outside <b>its</b> <b>native</b> range, but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The addax is a {{critically}} endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN.
