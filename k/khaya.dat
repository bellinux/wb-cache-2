5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko {{was born}} on 18 December 1946, at his grandmother's house in Tarkastad, Eastern Cape. The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko, he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, <b>Khaya,</b> and a younger sister, Nobandile. His parents had married in Whittlesea, where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was {{transferred}} to Queenstown, Port Elizabeth, Fort Cox, and finally King William's Town, where he and Alice settled in Ginsberg township. This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet. Both Bantu African and Coloured people lived in the township, where Xhosa, Afrikaans, and English were all spoken. After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office, while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa. Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at Grey Hospital in King William's Town. According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.|$|E

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} of a local tradition of nine Shwe-gu or “golden caves” and the 11 <b>khayaing</b> of Kyaukse, the rice fields that supplied Bagan. Drawing on survey and ongoing work at the Ta Mok <b>khayaing</b> Shwe-gu-gyi, we profile a local specificity essential to and yet far from the courts of 11 th– 17 th century Bagan, Pinya and Inwa. In its multiple encasements of images and architecture, the Ta Mok Shwe-gu-gyi records a transition from the visual complexity of Bagan period gu to the more iconic structures of the Pinya and Inwa eras...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally crafted djembes are {{carved from}} a single log of hardwood. A number of {{different}} wood species are used, {{all of which are}} hard and dense. Hardness and density are important factors for the sound and projection of the djembe. The most prized djembe wood is lenke (Afzelia africana), not because it necessarily sounds better than other woods, but because the Malinké believe that its spiritual qualities are superior. (Malinké traditional wisdom states that a spiritual energy, or nyama, runs through all things, living or dead.) Besides lenke, traditional woods include djalla (<b>Khaya</b> senegalensis), dugura (Cordyla africana), gueni (Pterocarpus erinaceus), gele (Prosopis africana), and iroko (Milicia excelsa).|$|E

5000|$|SL Records is {{a record}} label based in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was founded in 1997 and is known for {{releasing}} anti-folk, alternative rock, and indie pop albums.

Pybus started the label soon after graduating from university; [...] "SL" [...] in the label's name stands for [...] "student loans".

500|$|Biko {{spent two}} years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg. Regarded as a {{particularly}} intelligent pupil, {{he was allowed to}} skip a year. In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township. Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams. In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother <b>Khaya</b> as a student at Lovedale, a prestigious boarding school in Alice, Eastern Cape. Within three months of Steve's arrival, <b>Khaya</b> was accused of having connections to Poqo, the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), an African nationalist group which the government had banned. Both <b>Khaya</b> and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal. No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale. Commenting later on this situation, he stated: [...] "I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at anything else. I hated authority like hell." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2007, SAA {{launched}} an 18-month comprehensive restructuring programme which aimed {{to make the}} airline profitable. According to then-CEO <b>Khaya</b> Ngqula, this came largely after [...] "uncompetitive ownership and aircraft lease costs, excessive head count and fuel price volatility". The programme involves: the spin-off of businesses into seven subsidiaries, thereby allowing SAA to concentrate on its core business of passenger and cargo transport; grounding SAA's Boeing 747–400 fleet; rationalising international routes (Paris was dropped altogether); the axing of 30% of the airline's managers; among other reductions. This was expected to save the airline R2.7billion (US$378.2million). By June 2009, R2.5billion had been saved.|$|E

On the same day it was announced that a new ATP World Tour tournament would be held in South Africa in 2009. In 2010, the company sought to recover $4million from then-CEO <b>Khaya</b> Ngqula, for allegedly spending the money on his friends and awarding business deals with organisations and individuals in which he had an interest.
