This unexpected change from the precautions that Hist had previously manifested a desire to use, in order to prevent being seen, to an open exposure of the person of her friend, arose from the perfect conviction that no Indian would harm a being whom the Great Spirit had disarmed, by depriving it of its strongest <b>defence,</b> <b>reason.</b> In this respect, nearly all unsophisticated nations resemble each other, appearing to offer spontaneously, by a feeling creditable to human nature, that protection by their own forbearance, which has been withheld by the inscrutable wisdom of Providence. Wah-ta-Wah, indeed, knew that in many tribes the mentally imbecile and the mad were held in a species of religious reverence, receiving from these untutored inhabitants of the forest respect and honors, instead of the contumely and neglect that it is their fortune to meet with among the more pretending and sophisticated.|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 17th century it developed as a suburb called 'Hamburger Berg' (Hamburg mountain) outside the gates of the nearby city of Hamburg and close to the city of Altona. The name comes from a hill in that area that was planned by Hamburg in 1620 for <b>defence</b> <b>reasons</b> (free field of fire for the artillery). Therefore, settlement was initially allowed there, but soon businesses, which were desired inside neither Hamburg nor Altona, e.g. for their smell or noise, were relegated to 'Hamburger Berg'. Also the rope makers (or 'Reeper' in Low German) went here because in the city it was hard to find enough space for their work. The name of St. Pauli's most famous street Reeperbahn, or [...] "Rope Walk," [...] harkens back to its rope making past. When people were officially allowed to live in St. Pauli {{at the end of the}} 17th century the city government moved workhouses and (pestilence) hospitals out of the city to 'Hamburger Berg,' which later was named after its still existing church, 'St. Pauli' (Saint Paul). St. Pauli was mainly used by sailors for entertainment during their stay in Hamburg and Altona. To this day it is known as the sinful mile, combining the upper and common standards of entertainment, from musicals, theatres, to bars and clubs, as well as the most known red light district.|$|E

5000|$|Shoreham Beach, to {{the south}} of the town, is a shingle spit {{deposited}} over millennia by longshore drift, as an extension to Lancing parish in the west. This blocks the southerly flow of the River Adur which turns east at this point to discharge into the English Channel further along the coast at a point that has varied considerably over time. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the mouth of the river shifted eastwards which restricted trade to the port; by 1810 it was almost opposite Aldrington church. In 1816, work had been completed to fix the position of the river in its present position, flowing into the sea between two piers. Once the harbour mouth was stabilised it was defended by Shoreham Fort which was built in 1857. [...] Converted railway carriages became summer homes around the start of the 20th century, and 'Bungalow Town', as it was then known, became home to the early British film industry. Shoreham Beach officially became part of Shoreham-by-Sea in 1910. Much of the housing in the area was cleared for <b>defence</b> <b>reasons</b> during the Second World War and most of what remained after the war is now long gone, having been replaced by modern houses, some of which are extremely expensive, architect designed constructions. The Church of the Good Shepherd, built in 1913, still stands. Along the Adur mud flats adjacent to Shoreham Beach sits (and at high tides floats) a large collection of houseboats made from converted barges, tugs, mine sweepers, Motor Torpedo Boats etc. The seaside shingle bank of Shoreham beach extends further east past the harbour mouth, forming the southern boundary of the commercial harbour in Southwick, Portslade and Hove. The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath, commemorating the flight of Charles II to France after the Battle of Worcester, follows the beach westwards from Hove past Portslade and Southwick, terminating by the harbour mouth's east breakwater.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceSpecialised medical {{databases}} currently play a {{major role}} in archiving and searching for comparable data acquired by different modalities of medical imaging. In the context of storing and searching for data in medical databases, it is of immense importance to find a method of extracting and representing the contents found in the image that would ensure the rapid access and satisfactory results of searches for image information records. What is important, this representation should also be independent of the form of the image. The wide spread of multimedia medical databases that can store not just single images but also video sequences has shown that the problem of effectively searching for images containing specific disease cases that are significant for medical diagnostics is still fraught with great difficulties. This article presents a semantic retrieval methods in medical imaging databases using graph formalisms of syntactic image recognition which contribute to solving these problems. The proposed methods although they are mainly predestined for medical applications can also provide a base for other solutions, particularly for the acquisition and sophisticated semantic analysis of complex image patterns for security and <b>defence</b> <b>reasons...</b>|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of <b>Defence.</b> One <b>reason</b> for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|R

In 1946, the RAF's front line bomber was the Avro Lincoln, a development of the wartime Avro Lancaster. It did not have the range to reach targets in the Soviet Union, nor could it deal with jet fighter interceptors. Operational Requirement (OR229) called for a high-altitude jet bomber with a range of [...] carrying an atomic bomb.

Her Majesty's Government repeated this allegation more then sixty times until the WWI broke out. Between the years 1882 and 1914 Egypt was neither a colony nor protectorate de iure, nevertheless the British Consul-General in Cairo administrated the country in a de facto colonial way; the Khedive symbolised only the formal Head of State. During the ensuing decades, the British realised economic, politic, and administrative reforms. Improvement of irrigation system meant the greatest achievement. In the nineties, the reorganization of the Egyptian Administration caused the rise of the nationalist movement, which in 1906 culminated in Dinshaway Incident that forced the well-known proconsul Lord Cromer to leave Egypt.
