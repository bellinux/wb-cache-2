All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> {{whole country}} {{to know in}} detail what had {{happened}} at that factory, and to understand what had gone on there—the fruitless...lack of enforcement by the Department of Labor, the whole long lousy history of neglect, deceit and stupidity—was happening in dozens of other ways, in hundreds of other factories, to thousands of other men across the land. I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted them to know that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> {{video to}} have the same rawness that both the melody and the lyrics of the song have because [...] "Dance for You" [...] is one of my most {{intimate}} songs. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. When I write, when I perform, and when I make music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to be free and unrestrained.|$|E

500|$|Gibbard {{credited}} Nick Harmer's bass {{line with}} being {{integral to the}} song, noting inspiration from bassists Eric Avery and Simon Gallup. [...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... I liked the idea that once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it just keeps repeating in his head, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|E

500|$|The nine-minute second {{movement}} is for soprano, clarinets, horns, harp, piano, and strings, and contains a libretto formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by Blazusiakówna {{on the cell}} wall in Zakopane.

A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek. According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character [...] "for two reasons: <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [...] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are." ...|$|E

Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she {{said that it was}} common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that [...] " [...] very different actors". When she saw the two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone.

500|$|Madonna also {{understood}} that {{as she was}} growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world. The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public.

[...] In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. [...] One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, [...] "The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human".|$|E

500|$|Composer Bear McCreary {{changed his}} synth {{programming}} {{for the series}} from [...] "warm, round tones" [...] to a [...] "mangled under heavy distortion" [...] sound.

[...] Then, [...] "just as the audience begins to get used to" [...] the orchestral sound, the episode cuts to [...] "modern day and suddenly I bring in the new synths, with distorted basses blazing over the nastiest groove I've ever written for the show. The transition is hopefully as jarring as I intended—jumping from soaring orchestra to blasting electronica, as we leap forward in time seventy years." ...|$|E
