5|$|In the League Cup, {{the clubs}} {{met in the}} quarter-final stage at Old Trafford in December and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> sides fielded {{weakened}} teams, the match was not short of drama. David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that tempers began to flare. A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from both sets of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match official Mark Halsey. The game finished 1–0.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

Further, Jainism considers asceticism as an important means to spiritual liberation that ends all reincarnation, while Buddhism does not.|$|E

25|$|The north Indian Kathak dance {{differs from}} the south Indian Bharatanatyam in several ways, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> have roots in the Hindu text Natya Shastra. Kathak {{expressions}} – particularly in Hindu devotional styles – are more introverted and withdrawn, while Bharatanatyam is more extroverted and expansive. Kathak is normally performed in a standing form with legs and torso typically straight, while Bharatanatyam extensively utilizes bent knee form (ara mandi, half sitting position that is somewhat similar to Demi Plié ballet move).|$|E

Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne.

Those who argue that there is no ictus say that, given that there is generally a word-break (caesura) after the 5th element of the iambic senarius, the word accents tend to fall naturally on the second and fourth elements rather than on the anceps elements. In the final metron, there is often a clash between ictus and accent.|$|E

Christians Armenians formed a minority, comprising some 20%, and formed no majority in any of the mahals (districts). <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> Muslims and Armenians practised the various professions, it were the Armenians who dominated the trade and professions in the khanate.

During the studio sessions, Santana and Michael Shrieve brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, Armando Peraza replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing David Brown. Also assisting on keyboards were Wendy Haas and Tom Coster.

25|$|The reals are uncountable; that is: {{there are}} {{strictly}} more real numbers than natural numbers, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> sets are infinite. In fact, the cardinality of the reals equals {{that of the}} set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and Cantor's diagonal argument states that the latter set's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of N. Since the set of algebraic numbers is countable, almost all real numbers are transcendental. The non-existence of {{a subset of the}} reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the continuum hypothesis. The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved; it is independent from the axioms of set theory.|$|E
25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's dilemma, in which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>both</b> players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) are willing to pay to punish if one participant defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
