Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women.

On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

On the other hand, following the methodology proposed by Macpherson y Hirsch (1995), the paper studies the link between the wage gap and occupational segregation. Higher salaries are perceived in integrated occupations than in segregated. In turn, the wages of men are higher than women, except in the most feminized occupations. This evidence indicate noncompliance with the crowding hypothesis for Uruguay. Finally, through the decomposition proposed by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) this paper evidences that discrimination was established as the sole determinant of the gender wage gap in favor of men. innovation, <b>Gender</b> discrimination, occupational <b>segregation,</b> Duncan index, wage gap, Urugua...|$|R

In the gender wage gap literature, it has been found that the negative relation between wages and female proportion of an occupation is stronger among men than among women and that individual wages shift systematically with the gender composition of occupation. Some evidence suggests that such “wage penalty” associated with largely immigrant and brown-collar occupations may be experienced by Hispanics in some main immigrant-receiving metropolitan areas (Catanzarite 1998; Catanzarite 2002; Tienda 1998).|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, massive rural - urban {{migration}} in China has attracted considerable attention from economists and policymakers, {{both within and}} outside China. One of the most striking features of rural - urban migration is that job attainment among the migrants differs considerably between males and females. It is of great interest to know the reasons for this difference and, more importantly, whether <b>gender</b> occupational <b>segregation</b> has a large impact on the gender wage differential among migrants. This paper examines these issues using data on 1504 migrants collected in Jinan city, Shandong province. It is found that <b>gender</b> occupational <b>segregation</b> in this sector is mainly due to the unequal treatment of male and female attributes in occupational assignment and that this contributes very significantly to the gender wage differential among migrants. A comparison with another study on China's rural industrial labour market is made, which suggest that intra-occupational gender wage discrimination is lower in the labour market for rural - urban migrants than in the labour market in the rural industrial sector. ...|$|R

25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, {{to see whether or}} not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational <b>gender</b> <b>segregation</b> and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
25|$|Emotional labor {{also affects}} women by perpetuating {{occupational}} segregation and the gender wage gap. Job segregation, {{which is the}} systematic tendency {{for men and women}} to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and empathizing are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations. The emotion work expected of many female employees is essentially invisible and uncompensated while the employer gains profit more generally. Thus, according to Guy and Newman (2004), ignored and uncompensated emotional labor is at least one underlying cause for both occupational <b>gender</b> <b>segregation</b> and the gender wage gap.|$|E

Their main goal has rather been to support women’s labor-force participation and to promote gender equality. The focus is to strengthen individuals {{so that they are}} able to pursue their family and occupational tracks without being too strongly dependent on other individuals. The reconciliation of family and working life of women has been facilitated by (i) individual taxation and individual-based social-security systems, which makes it less attractive for couples to pursue <b>gendered</b> <b>segregation</b> of work and care, (ii) an income-replacement based parental-leave system, which gives women incentives to establish themselves in the labor market before considering childbirth, and (iii) subsidized child-care, which allows women to return to work after parental leave. Fertility has fluctuated during recent decades but, as in the other Nordic countries with a similar welfare-state setup, it has stayed well above the European average. The Swedish institutional context clearly is conducive to such “highest-low” fertility. In this review, I provide evidence that institutional factors appear to be far more decisive than cultural ones in shaping childbearing behavior, and demonstrate some specific impacts of family policies on childbearing dynamics...|$|R

500|$|While {{during the}} late 19th century, no formal {{segregation}} {{of men and women}} was to be found at the Wall, conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the <b>gender</b> <b>segregation</b> customary at Orthodox places of worship. The progressives responded by claiming that [...] "the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism." [...] In 1988, the small but vocal Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of non-Orthodox prayer at the Wall. Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site. In response to the repeated arrest of women, including Anat Hoffman found flouting the law, the Jewish Agency observed 'the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife." [...] Some commentators called for the closure of the site unless an acceptable solution to the controversy was found. In 2003 Israel's Supreme Court upheld the ban on non-Orthodox worship at the Wall and the government responded by allocating Robinson's Arch for such purposes. But in 2012, critics still complained about the restrictions at the Western Wall, saying Israel had [...] "turned a national monument into an ultra-Orthodox synagogue," [...] and in April 2013 the Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there was no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer, prayer according to non-Orthodox custom should be allowed at the Wall. This led to the expansion and renovation of the Robinson's Arch prayer area which would be placed under the authority of a Pluralist Council. In August 2013, a platform named [...] "Azarat Yisrael Plaza" [...] was completed to facilitate non-Orthodox worship.|$|E
