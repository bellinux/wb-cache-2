Materia have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E

5|$|He {{held the}} vicarage of Lochrutton in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1388, when a papal letter {{indicated}} that {{he was expected to}} resign Lochrutton after obtaining the benefice of Maybole in the gift of the Prioress of the nunnery of North Berwick. He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven {{was laid}} out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre {{counties}}. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19thcentury largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before {{the founding of the}} town, the lumber industry was well established.|$|E

The agency receives 4.2 percent of the Commonwealth Transportation Trust Fund, a fund that's generated by fuel taxes, vehicle sales and use taxes, and some sales taxes.

In the 1880 race, the Phelps/Pomeroy ticket garnered only 1,045 votes nationwide.

25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed.

25|$|Economist Joseph Stiglitz {{argues that}} hyper-inequality may explain {{political}} questions – such as why America's infrastructure (and other public investments) are deteriorating, or the country's recent {{relative lack of}} reluctance to engage in military conflicts such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Top-earning families, wealthy enough to buy their own education, medical care, personal security, and parks, have little interest in helping pay <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> {{for the rest of}} society, and the political influence to make sure they don't have to. So too, the lack of personal or family sacrifice involved for top earners in the military intervention of their country – their children being few and far between in the relatively low-paying all-volunteer military – may mean more willingness by influential wealthy to see its government wage war.|$|E
