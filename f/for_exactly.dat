5|$|Humphrey Stafford {{had been}} Earl of Devon <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> three {{months at the}} time of his death. He and Isabel had no children, so when he died his title became extinct. It was {{restored}} the next year for John Courtenay, the brother of Thomas, the last Courtenay earl of Devon. Stafford was buried in Glastonbury Abbey, and a dispute over his lands followed between his cousins.|$|E
5|$|The fifth Test, {{which saw}} {{the debut of}} Richie Benaud {{alongside}} Ring, was an anticlimax, and Ring contributed little with either bat or ball to a large Australian victory. In the series as a whole, among the regular players, Ring finished behind only Hassett and Miller as a batsman, with 197 runs {{at an average of}} 28.14, and he took 13 wickets <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> 30 apiece.|$|E

Soon after, on 31 October, Hauptmann (Captain) Specht was promoted to Kommandeur of III./NJS 1. Located at Ingolstadt-Manching, Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. Paul Zorner, a future night fighter expert, {{was one of his}} students. Leading the Gruppe <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> one year, this was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.|$|E

5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a geomagnetic reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|When it was active, Hurricane Ava set many records. Several {{have since}} been broken, but Ava still holds a few. Ava ceased being a Category5 {{hurricane}} on June 7, 1973. 1994's Emilia reached Category5 intensity on July 19, 1994. This span of 7,712days, which Ava began and Emilia ended, is the longest time between successive Category5 hurricanes in the northeastern Pacific, and anywhere worldwide, in recorded history. When Hurricane Gilma reached Category5 strength on July 24 also in 1994, it marked the shortest gap between Category5 Pacific hurricanes recorded. Ava was also a Category5 hurricane <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> 24hours; a record at the time. Hurricane John broke that in the 1994 season, and hurricanes Linda and Ioke also lasted longer, tied with John. In addition, Ava is the strongest June tropical cyclone {{in the western hemisphere}} north of the equator.|$|E

25|$|On 17 May, Colebatch resigned, {{having been}} premier <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> one month. It remains the state's {{shortest}} premiership term on record. His decision to resign {{was influenced by}} the stress of the wharf crisis and extensive subsequent criticism. However his health was an issue, and he had been unable to find a Legislative Assembly seat in a country electorate as desired. H.G.P. Colebatch (2004) also asserts that Colebatch resigned as premier because he was not ambitious and had not wanted the job in the first place.|$|E

Coincidentally, Sean was fired <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> the same reason that his Series 5 counterpart Rocky Andrews was; namely presiding over a crushing defeat on a task that he should have been an expert in, and bringing the wrong people back into the boardroom.|$|E

Fenner's 9th Jäger battalion, three squadrons of light horse, six guns, and 1,000 irregulars were driven off with about 100 casualties. The Bavarians lost 40 dead and wounded.|$|E
25|$|Mark Hardinges {{took four}} for 40 to help Gloucestershire Gladiators record a thumping victory over Hampshire Hawks, after tying down and {{frustrating}} the opponents' batsmen. Hardinges {{was the main}} culprit as Hampshire lost their last nine wickets <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> 100 runs to post a total of 178, despite Nic Pothas, Sean Ervine and Shane Watson all making at least 40. In reply, William Weston and Matt Windows paired up for 106 runs for the second wicket, and not even Chris Tremlett, who took three for 34, could stop Gloucestershire from reaching the target with more than ten overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, several American {{networks}} {{have begun to}} start certain shows shortly before or after :00 or :30 past the hour to avert audience loss. Global does not necessarily follow this practice, meaning {{the last few minutes}} of the preceding show may be lost to those watching the U.S. network. For instance, if NBC schedules The Apprentice to start at 9:02, but Global schedules its start <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> 9:00, the last two minutes of NBC's 8:00 program may be blocked by the Global signal. This is not unique to Global and may vary by service provider, since cable/satellite providers, not the networks, are responsible for scheduling and initiating simsubs.|$|E

Landrith was the third brother of three to recently catch for Northwestern High, and as Landrith graduated and briefly went to Michigan State before being signed by the Cincinnati Reds, his high school successor was Harry Chiti.

25|$|In Russia, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation {{passed a}} decree {{that made the}} USSR 1991 Fundamentals {{effective}} in Russia from August 3, 1992 on, insofar as these Fundamentals contradicted neither the Constitution of the Russian Federation nor other legislative acts of Russia passed after June 12, 1990, and only on a temporary basis until the Russian Federation would have adopted a new, own Civil Code. The original USSR executive decree for the 1991 Fundamentals, which laid down the transitory provisions, did not enter in force in Russia, though, and the old Russian Civil Code remained in force insofar as it didn't contradict the 1991 Fundamentals. Section IV of the 1991 Fundamentals was thus in effect <b>for</b> <b>exactly</b> one year until on August 3, 1993, the new Copyright law of Russia entered in Force.|$|E
