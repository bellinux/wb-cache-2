5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> — including in his ghosted autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning that this might improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over two decades, in press articles, his autobiography and Who's Who — but not on official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E

To this I merely answer that he does it because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> happy, because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> hilarious, because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a man and alive. He is so young that climbing garden trees and playing silly practical jokes are still to him what they once were to us all. And {{if you ask me}} yet again why he alone among men should be fed with such inexhaustible follies, I have a very simple answer to that, though it is one that will not be approved.|$|R

25|$|Sauron's {{plan would}} have succeeded had the Elves not {{detected}} his influence {{when he put}} on the One Ring. It was then the Elves saw him for who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> removed their Rings, and did not use them {{for as long as}} Sauron retained the One Ring. Enraged, Sauron initiated a great war and conquered much of the land west of Anduin. The Three Rings, however, had been forged by Celebrimbor himself without Sauron's help. These rings were saved and remained {{in the hands of the}} Elves, specifically Gil-galad, Círdan, and Galadriel.|$|E
25|$|On the {{edition of}} September 24 of Impact! Foley turned heel {{again when he}} {{attacked}} Abyss during and after a TNA World Tag Team Championship match against Booker T and Scott Steiner. Foley revealed Abyss {{as the one who}} tore up his picture and beat him to a bloody pulp with a video tape and the baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. Abyss then challenged Foley to a Monster's Ball match which Foley accepted. At Bound for Glory Abyss defeated Foley in the match. Two weeks later, Foley turned face by turning on Dr. Stevie and saved Abyss from him. The following week he explained that he had played Dr. Stevie all along and had challenged Abyss to a match at Bound for Glory in order to see how tough <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> On the edition of November 12 of Impact! Raven returned to TNA and saved Stevie's future in the company by costing Abyss a match and throwing a fireball in Foley's face.|$|E

25|$|It transpires that Husk's {{personality}} {{shifts and}} subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal where {{caused by a}} secondary mutation which means her powers now also affect her mind {{as well as her}} body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

[...] "There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him.

500|$|This {{theory was}} relied {{upon by the}} Cabinet and the Army Council, which ordered on 9 August that Lody was to be tried by a court martial. There was some {{confusion}} about whether Haldane had really meant a court martial rather than a military tribunal, and the Adjutant General questioned whether DORA had limited the maximum punishment for espionage to penal servitude for life, rather than the death penalty. Further confusion {{was caused by the}} fact that Lody's identity had not yet been fully established.

500|$|Despite {{the various}} changes from real-life events, Abagnale {{believed}} Spielberg {{was the only}} filmmaker who [...] "could do this film justice". However, Abagnale had little involvement with the film. In November 2001, he had [...] "never met nor spoken to Steven Spielberg and I have not read the script. I prefer not to. I understand that they now portray my father in a better light, as <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> Steven Spielberg has told the screenplay writer (Jeff Nathanson) that he wants complete accuracy in the relationships and actual scams that I perpetrated", Abagnale reported.

500|$|Carter {{writes about}} how the [...] "Team Coco" [...] {{movement}} and fans impacted O'Brien following the controversy, [...] "The outpouring of support made Conan feel {{as if he was}} starring in his own version of the movie It's a Wonderful Life, both because he was allowed to see a 'Tonight Show' where he never existed and because the support made him realize <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> 'the richest man in town.'" [...] O'Brien was hurt by the fact that Leno did not communicate directly with him during the fiasco. Carter also says that compared to the eventual payout to O'Brien of $45 million, NBC would have suffered a financial loss of $235 million if O'Brien had left the company in 2004 to host a talk show for another network. O'Brien moved from NBC to host his own late night program on TBS. Carter's work concludes with an interview from comic Jerry Seinfeld, who favored Leno; Seinfeld argues that O'Brien should have remained at NBC.|$|E
500|$|Harper officially {{resigned}} his parliament {{seat and}} left the Rhodesian Front on 11 July 1968. Wilson publicly welcomed his departure as a [...] "step in the right direction", prompting a retort from Smith {{that he did not}} appoint or sack ministers to please the British government. Smith said that Harper had been depicted as more extreme than <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> and denied that he had obstructed a settlement. In retrospect, Smith said he had been glad to be rid of Harper, who he considered underhand and devious. Harper ignored an approach from the ultra-right-wing Rhodesian National Party, offering the leadership, and for a time withdrew from public affairs. Montrose and the ministers AP Smith and Phillip van Heerden briefly threatened to follow Harper out of the government, but backed down within a few days. After a fresh dispute Montrose resigned on 11 September 1968 in protest against Smith's proposed constitutional and racial policies, which he deemed too liberal. A week later the RF's Albert Mells easily won the by-election to fill Harper's former seat in Gatooma.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E

Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City.

The Hindu in its Cinema Plus feature called the film [...] "a perfect combination of music, dance and humour," [...] while also stating that the film can be enjoyed even today. Randor Guy praised Balaiah's acting in the film, saying, [...] "In one song, the famous Tyagaraja kriti in Abheri, ‘Nagumomu Kanaleni’, Balaiah played the thavil in excellent sync with the background song that was recorded earlier in the studio, revealing how adept <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> with the instrument". C. V. Aravind of The News Minute was also positive towards Balaiah's performance, in addition to those of Thangavelu, T. R. Ramachandran and Sarangkapani. On Manorama's performance, N. Kesavan of The Hindu wrote, [...] "One can never forget her role as 'Jil Jil Ramamani' in [...] "Thillana Mohanambal."

500|$|St. John and {{the writers}} {{received}} {{praise for the}} recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show's canvas. Soap Opera Weekly stated, [...] "They said it couldn't be done. One Life to Live's Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, One Life to Live may just have done it". The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd's identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints {{that he might be}} Todd. [...] By the time he disclosed who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. Soap Opera Weekly called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, [...] "one of those great (and, these days, rare) must-see moments". [...] Soap Opera Digest said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, [...] "St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who's really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker". The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: [...] "We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker's gaze was always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret". The article also credited St. John with maintaining [...] "the [...] relationship of Todd and Starr" [...] and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful.|$|E
