25|$|Other arylcyclohexylamines and analogues of {{ketamine}} include <b>eticyclidine</b> (PCE), 3-MeO-PCE, methoxetamine (MXE), tiletamine, phencyclidine (PCP), tenocyclidine (TCP), {{and many}} others.|$|E
50|$|Dieticyclidine (PCDE), or diethylphenylcyclohexylamine, is a {{psychoactive drug}} and {{research}} chemical of the arylcyclohexylamine chemical class related to phencyclidine (PCP) and <b>eticyclidine</b> (PCE). It {{acts as an}} NMDA receptor antagonist but has low potency and acts mainly as a prodrug for <b>eticyclidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phencyclamine or PCPr is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} drug with hallucinogenic and stimulant effects. It {{is around}} the same potency as phencyclidine, although slightly less potent than its ethyl homologue <b>eticyclidine,</b> and has reportedly been sold as a designer drug in Germany and other European countries since the late 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Fewer than 30 {{different}} analogues of PCP {{were reported}} as being used on the street during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the USA. The best known of these are rolicyclidine (PCPy or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine); <b>eticyclidine</b> (PCE or N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine); and tenocyclidine (TCP or 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine). Only of {{a few of these}} compounds were widely used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eticyclidine</b> (PCE, CI-400) is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} drug with hallucinogenic effects. It {{is similar}} in effects to phencyclidine but is slightly more potent. PCE was developed by Parke-Davis in the 1970s and evaluated for anesthetic potential under the code name CI-400, but research into PCE was not continued after the development of ketamine, a similar drug with more favourable properties. PCE is slightly more potent than PCP and has similar effects, but its unpleasant taste and tendency to cause nausea made it less accepted by users. Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, PCE was placed into the Schedule 1 list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it was only briefly abused in the 1970s and 1980s and is now little known.|$|E
