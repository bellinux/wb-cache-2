25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E
5000|$|All their SLR cameras, {{except the}} dx-3, had {{interchangeable}} pentaprisms (released by moving a button or twisting {{the base of}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>knob),</b> and a unique dual lens mount; an external bayonet mount or a 44mm thread mount within the mirror box.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, {{and the film}} rewind release button.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the camera {{contains}} the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> release lever, the rewind release button [...] and the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob,</b> which {{is also used to}} open the back. Printing on the bottom includes loading instructions, daylight exposure table, flash exposure table, (both based on ASA 10 film) and suggestions for common focus settings.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Realist, the Kodak had a self-cocking shutter. Like later model Realists it {{had built}} in double exposureprevention {{which could be}} {{overridden}} by the manual shutter cocking lever located {{on the bottom of}} the camera. Releasing the shutter also released the wind mechanism, so once a picture was taken the user needed only to wind the film to be ready for the next one. The <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> has a crank, which most consider an improvement over the ordinary <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> on the Realist.|$|R
50|$|Some RF {{models have}} black knobs {{and some have}} black {{rangefinder}} protrusion next to the lens, but the majority have plated metal knobs. There was no civil production between 1942 and 1945. The post-war viewfinder and the rangefinder models were also black with bright-chromed metal features, and an accessory shoe {{was added to the}} viewfinder model next to the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> However, for a while during the period from 1947 to 1949, the knobs were also made of white plastic instead of metal. Both the metal- and the white <b>rewind</b> <b>knobs</b> have a <b>film</b> reminder dial in the hub.|$|R

50|$|For {{the mercury}} battery PX 13 (= PX 625 = MR 9) {{of the light}} meter, a place was found inside the camera housing. The <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> of the {{engineering}} model was exchanged for a rewind crank, and a hot shoe was added for mounting an electronic flash at the base plate. Placing the hot shoe {{on top of the}} camera was not feasible because of the underlying exposure meter andtransmission gear. Mounting the hot shoe at the frame cover would likely cause damage when using one of the heavy flash lights of that time. Therefore, for a natural lighting shade, the camera had to be turned upside down, when using a flash, to get the light source above the lens. The projected name for the camera was at first to be the Rollei Privat, which even was the engraving on the final draft in March 1966. But in April 1966, when Peesel decided to designate all Rollei cameras according to the applied film format, the designation became Rollei 35.|$|E
5000|$|M4 - 1967-75 (50,000 {{sets were}} manufactured); 1974-75 (6,500 sets were manufactured). With added {{rangefinder}} framelines for 35 mm and 135 mm lenses. Introduced the canted rewind crank (the previous Ms had <b>rewind</b> <b>knobs).</b> With the M5, {{was the last}} M camera to have a self-timer.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940 the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> becomes smaller - Ø21 mm, {{while the}} wind-on knob is Ø27 mm. Cameras with brown, dark brown, red and {{possibly}} dark green leather covering are {{alternatives to the}} black leather, some have grey or black metal finish. Flat patent carrying strap fixtures are introduced.|$|R
50|$|Several {{finishes}} appeared {{during the}} production run. The body is black Bakelite and top and base is chromed metal. When first introduced the collapsible viewfinder {{on top of the}} camera was black and the knobs on top of the camera were black Bakelite, while the military viewfinder camera were olive drab with blackened metal parts. There were no civil production between 1942 and 1945. The post-war viewfinder and the rangefinder models were also black with bright-chromed metal features, and an accessory shoe was added to the viewfinder model next to the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> However, for a while during the period from 1947 to 1949, the knobs were also made of white plastic instead of metal. Both the metal- and the white <b>rewind</b> <b>knobs</b> have a <b>film</b> reminder dial in the hub.|$|R
50|$|An {{accessory}} shoe {{was on the}} top of the housing, but without a 'hot-shoe' contact. The <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> held a <b>film</b> speed reminder, covering ASA 8-800/DIN 10-30, but no folding rewind handle. The frame counter needed to be reset manually. It counted down from the number of exposures in the roll to zero.|$|R
50|$|The Rectaflex series B 4000 (s/n 4001 to some 4500) had a {{modified}} A/R lever. The Rectaflex series B 16000 (s/n 16001 to 16870) had a triple sync plug and a film reminder under the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> The Rectaflex series B 20000 (s/n 20101 to 20300) had an internally modified shutter and a reinforced bayonet mount. This {{was only a}} test series.|$|R
50|$|During its {{production}} run, Nikon replaced the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> spool for these cameras {{due to a}} manufacturing defect.|$|R
50|$|He {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film</b> <b>Rewind</b> This {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video.|$|R
50|$|There is a self timer, flash, autofocus, ISO range, and <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The ISO {{range is}} a black slider {{on the bottom of}} the camera.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Leech {{appeared}} in the HBO drama series Rome as Marcus Agrippa, Octavian's top soldier and friend. The <b>film,</b> <b>Rewind,</b> opened in Ireland on 25 March 2011.|$|R
50|$|Oshii {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film,</b> <b>Rewind</b> This! {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also recently had a get-together with Duncan Jones.|$|R
50|$|The camera has a hinged, swing-open, {{camera back}} with cut-out view window toshow {{details of the}} film loaded in the camera. <b>Film</b> loading,advance and <b>rewind</b> is {{motorised}} and automatic. A button to manually trigger <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> isalso provided. <b>Film</b> sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encodingor the ISO value can be selected manually.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> to the opening scene when Angélique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the {{delivery}} boy and the subsequent events play out from Loïc's viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The self timer was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter speed dial. The lock button for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted <b>rewind</b> release, and <b>film</b> speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank.|$|R
50|$|Film {{transport}} in the T80 {{is completely}} automatic, {{just as in}} the T70, in both directions. This leaves the top of the camera very clean, since there is no advance lever or <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> <b>Film</b> loading is automatic; the user only has to align the film leader with an orange mark and close the back, and the camera loads and advances the film automatically. Indicators on the top LCD display the status of loading, winding and rewinding. The motor, and the camera's other functions including the focusing motor in the lens, are powered by 4 AAA batteries housed in the base of the camera.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush {{cover with}} no protruding controls. When flipped open, it reveals the waist-level finder. On {{the right-hand side}} is the single-stroke wind-on lever with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> with a <b>film</b> reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the ¼ inch tripod socket, the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back.|$|R
5000|$|... 1957: Asahi Pentax (Japan; called Sears Tower 26 in USA): first SLR with {{right-handed}} rapid-wind thumb lever, first fold-out <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, first microprism focusing aid. First Asahi SLR with M42 screw mount. Established the [...] "modern" [...] control {{layout of}} the 35 mm SLR. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism design.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF has a hinged, swing-open, {{camera back}} with cut-out view window {{to show the}} film loaded in the camera. Film loading, advance and rewind is {{motorised}} and automatic. A button to manually trigger <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> is also provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encoding or the ISO value can be selected manually.|$|R
50|$|Henenlotter {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film</b> <b>Rewind</b> This!, {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also appeared with the film's director, Josh Johnson, when it screened at film festivals such as the Telluride Horror Show. In 2014, he directed Chasing Banksy, which was screened with a visit of Henenlotter at New York City Forbidden Planet.|$|R
50|$|The F-501 is a 35 mm single-lens {{reflex camera}} with {{automatic}} film loading and advance, almost {{a first for}} Nikon (the F-301 was their first SLR to feature this). The built-in motor drive provides single (one exposure and frame advance per shutter button press) or continuous (shutter will fire and film will advance {{so long as the}} shutter button is depressed) modes. Maximum film advance speed is 2.5 frames per second (frame/s) on continuous mode, but can be as slow as 1.4 frames/s depending on the status of the focus/exposure locks. Rewind is accomplished manually by a familiar <b>rewind</b> <b>knob</b> which doubled as a release for the back. The F-501 is powered by four AAA batteries housed {{in the bottom of the}} camera body, although it can utilize AA sized batteries with an optional attachment (MB-3).|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{control was}} {{aperture}} priority AE using center-weighted light metering. Film speeds {{of the camera}} range from ASA 25 to ASA 1600. Film winding was done by using the film-wind lever located on the top right of the camera. <b>Film</b> <b>rewinding</b> was done manually using the film-rewind crank located at the top left. The camera body measured 136 × 83 × 50 mm and weighed approximately 430 g.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|R
50|$|The stop-down lever at the {{right-hand}} camera front also operates the self-timer. Pushing the lever towards the lens activates the stop down match-needle meter, while pulling {{in the opposite}} direction winds the timer. As with the Canon FX and FP, the camera back is opened turning a key at the base. The film speed is set lifting and turning the rim of the shutter speed dial. The camera is designed for the obsolete 1.35 volt mercury battery, which fortunately may be directly replaced by a similar 1.4 volt hearing aid battery, it is usable for about a year after activation whether used or not. The battery compartment is at the left-hand edge of the camera, next to the <b>rewind</b> <b>knob.</b> The Pellix was replaced by the improved Canon Pellix QL first marketed in March 1966. Improvements included the addition of a quick film loading mechanism and contacts in the base of the battery compartment for a separately available electronic booster for the internal exposure meter.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of a static application, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) product Clevios P (Figure 7) from Heraeus has been {{extensively}} used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). AGFA coats 200 m × 10 m of photographic film per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its antistatic properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during <b>film</b> <b>rewinding,</b> and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.|$|R
50|$|Accessories for the OM-4 {{included}} all the Olympus motor drives {{made for the}} OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to automatic film advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4.|$|R
50|$|The F4 was {{the first}} Nikon F-series lacking a manual film-advance lever, though it offered both {{motor-driven}} and manual <b>film</b> <b>rewinding.</b> Like previous F-series cameras, the F4 featured {{a high degree of}} customization to specific tasks, with various remote controls, film backs, and viewfinders available. While it was a complex camera with over 1700 parts, the F4's high-quality mechanical and electronic components, as well as weather sealing and tough construction, made for a reliable and long-lived professional SLR.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} of the Leica M2. Although most models have the self-timer lever, it is absent from some earlier models. Also, some early models have a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> push-button instead of the typical lever. About 2400 M2s were factory-painted black, but these are relatively rare and more valued by collectors. Near the end of production, Leica also produced a number of M2-R models, which had the faster loading system of the later Leica M4.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank. Manually <b>rewinding</b> <b>film</b> could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler.|$|R
