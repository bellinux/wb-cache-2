5000|$|The Seneca had {{previously}} brought {{suit against the}} state {{on the issue of}} the <b>highway</b> <b>easement.</b> The court in 1999 had ruled that the State could not be sued by the tribe. [...] In Magistrate Heckman's [...] "Report and Recommendation", it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint. One count was the Seneca Tribe's challenge regarding the state's acquisition of Grand Island and other smaller islands in the Niagara River, and the second count challenged the state's thruway easement.|$|E
5000|$|Ogden is an unincorporated {{locality}} on {{the outskirts}} of the gold-mining ghost town of Bralorne, British Columbia, Canada. Now mostly abandoned, Ogden was once a bustling centre of commercial activities not tolerated in the company-run town, many of its establishments built on the <b>highway</b> <b>easement</b> or small parcels of steep mountainside flanking the road. Among these were Zada's [...] "sporting house" [...] (where sewing was taken in for bachelor miners), which once suffered a small landslide through the main parlour but was back in operation soon after, and the once-famous Mines Hotel, known in the mining industry as [...] "the main stope", which featured a miniature mining operation atop its gold-ore fireplace mantel. The first two versions of the Mines Hotel burned down soon after they were built, and the third, which stood until 1984 when it was destroyed by a furnace explosion, was built in a plain boxy style very different from the original alpine-timber design. Ogden's heyday faded long before Bralorne closed, and only a few buildings survive other than a few houses. Ogden remains on the official listing of localities in British Columbia, and is used by locals as a reference to the general area where the [...] "town" [...] of Ogden had been.|$|E

50|$|Easements in English law are rights within English {{land law}} that one {{individual}} has over another's land. Rights recognised as easements most frequently include {{rights of way}} or light, and extend {{as far as the}} right to use a neighbour's lavatory, or to park a car on their land. The necessity of easements can be recognised by the Law Commission's recent findings that there are easements over at least 65% of registered freehold titles. In some circumstances for example, it may be impossible for one land owner to access a public <b>highway</b> without an <b>easement</b> of a right of way. The creation of easements is usually done expressly by deed, but easements may be implied where they are necessary, or would be reasonably expected to be held by a land owner, an approach which is not altogether uncontroversial, and {{has been the subject of}} recent reform proposals.|$|R
