500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia, many music critics {{considered}} that Smith {{lost much of}} the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits (1997), Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the [...] "grain" [...] in her voice. Jurek went on to write, [...] "It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style." [...] In 1974 Smith released the singles [...] "I Never <b>Knew</b> (<b>What</b> <b>That</b> Song Meant Before)" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Baby on My Mind", which both reached No.13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was {{a tribute to the}} gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular [...] "Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)" [...] as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously-made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles: [...] "(Till) I Kissed You" [...] and [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". After releasing two more studio albums in 1976, Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1990, {{over a dozen}} {{newspapers}} were launched, in either Kinyarwanda or French methodically exploited ethnic tensions. In December 1990, the newspaper Kangura printed the Hutu Ten Commandments of which four dealt specifically with women. On 29 January 1992, Kangura accused Tutsi women of having a monopoly on employment in both {{the private and public}} sectors, saying that they would hire their [...] "Tutsi sisters {{on the basis of their}} thin noses" [...] (a stereotypical 'Tutsi feature'). Kangura requested that all Hutu be vigilant against the Tutsi, who they called Inyenzi (cockroaches), as well as those considered accomplices. In an interview with Human Rights Watch one Hutu woman stated, [...] "According to the propaganda, the Tutsi were hiding the enemy. And their beautiful women were being used to do it. So, everybody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fight {{took place}} on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 people, at a ring built just for the {{occasion}} in downtown Reno, Nevada. Jeffries proved unable to impose his will on the younger champion and Johnson dominated the fight. By the 15th round, after Jeffries had been knocked down twice {{for the first time}} in his career, Jeffries' corner threw in the towel to end the fight and prevent Jeffries from having a knockout on his record. Johnson later remarked he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut and saw the look on Jeffries face, stating, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> look meant. The old ship was sinking." [...] Afterwards, Jeffries was humbled by the loss and what he'd seen of Johnson in their match. [...] "I could never have whipped Johnson at my best", Jeffries said. [...] "I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years." ...|$|E
