5000|$|In {{an essay}} on van Genk's library, Patrick Allegaert and Bart Marius {{repeatedly}} suggest {{that it should be}} considered an integral part of van Genk's artistic oeuvre. Van Genk read widely in at least three languages, with fluency in German and English as well as Dutch. His library housed books on many subjects reflecting his wide-ranging interests: [...] "general art history, music history, art brut and naive art, Soviet Russian aviation, trains, buses, trams, sexuality, countries and cities, world history..." [...] Allegaert and Marius note that there were no books on psychiatry in van Genk's library. Although Allegaert and Marius argue for the <b>exceptional</b> <b>import</b> of van Genk's library, claiming that [...] "it is part of his artistic production," [...] they only show how van Genk used his library as source material, an image bank to draw on and transform in his drawings, paintings, and collages: [...] "And herein lies the importance of his library," [...] they write. [...] "The realism and accurateness of his work were made possible thanks to the visual memory bank to which van Genk had access in his books." [...] It is not uncommon, however, for artists to use books as source material. What is uncommon is to consider the source material part of the artistic production.|$|E

The reforms carried out {{with the support of the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) attracted large inflows of capital which allowed to increase the reserves and to finance, through the expansion of credit, a growth process mainly caused by the increase in private investment. Because of the <b>exceptional</b> growth in <b>imports</b> (brought about by the real appreciation of the exchange rate and by trade liberalization) and because of capital movement liberalization, the contribution of the private sector to the increase in reserves was modest. That increase, which was necessary to finance the expansion of aggregate demand, was mainly insured by increasing public foreign debt. This conclusion is in sharp contrast with the IMFâ€™s point of view according to which the crisis of the convertibility regime was mainly due to the lack of fiscal discipline during the years of high growth. In the second part of the paper the recession period (1999 - 2001) is examined. The decision of the Argentine government to keep the peso pegged to the dollar after the Brazilian devaluation, and capital movements freedom, strongly supported by the IMF, made necessary to adopt restrictive fiscal policies in order to slow down inflation and stimulate exports. In fact, those measures worsened the recession: the positive effect on exports was more than compensated by the contemporary fall in consumption and investments...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of the fact that speakers not seldom intend to convey imports which deviate from the linguistically expressed meanings of linguistic items, the present article addresses some consequences of this phenomenon which appear to still be neglected in textual studies. It is suggested that understanding behaviour is in some respect a primary objective of exegesis and that due attention must be attributed to the high diversity of behaviour-related criteria by which interpretations of linguistic items are to be evaluated. Although we intimate in addition that individual (meaningful) sentences occurring either in oral conversations or in written documents generally exhibit a multiplicity of contents of diverse types and that the circumstance that sometimes only a content equalling the linguistic significance of a pertinent unit matters for purposes of interpretation is caused by a material coincidence of different varieties of content, the tenets advocated in the paper do not essentially depend on that view. On the other hand, the following assumptions are relevant in the present connection: (a) A number of deviances between imports conveyed by linguistic utterances and literal meanings of expressions occur due to maxims of linguistic behaviour that are quite independent of lexical and syntactic features of individual natural languages. (b) It is by no means an <b>exceptional</b> phenomenon that <b>imports</b> not derivable by grammatical rules of a particular language alone possess primary importance for interpretation and textual exegesis. In view of significant affinities between understanding of sentences and of texts it is argued that the consideration of diverse aspects of behaviour possesses relevance for textual exegesis at least in the following respects: (1) By delivering a heuristic device for discerning problems affecting adopted interpretations it encourages searches for alternatives. (2) It provides means for evaluating the degree of acceptability of particular textual exegeses and possibly rejecting them on a more rational basis than mere intuition. (3) It offers possibilities for critically assessing the validity of explicit arguments advanced in favour of or in opposition to some interpretation. (4) It furnishes a background for assessing certain disputes about translation. The dimension of linguistic behaviour also attains importance in connection with questions of exegesis which are not concerned with assessments of (propositional) contents intended to be communicated, such as the ascertainment of the function which some argument possesses in a context. For substantiating the thesis that omission of raising relevant questions concerning behaviour is not an isolated phenomenon two examples will be employed: (1) A discussion concerning the exegesis of a crucial passage of DignAga's PramAa(1) double dagger asamuccaya and the PramAa(1) double dagger asamuccayava(1) > tti, (2) a critical appraisal of a recent publication dealing with the interpretation of the second chapter of NAgArjuna's MA << lamadhyamakakArikA-s.
