25|$|A further {{element of}} this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press {{agencies}} revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia {{to participate in the}} project. JAXA <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{they are more likely to}} join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{symbolism}} of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century as there was a warming of relations between the pan-Blue coalition in Taiwan and the Communist Party of China on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of Taiwan independence. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring Sun Yat-Sen at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing.|$|E

Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, {{a strong supporter of}} the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though many think that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall's group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan.|$|E

500|$|Thirdly, {{apart from}} issues {{of foreign affairs}} and {{national}} defence, there are other areas that are non-justiciable such as the interpretation of international treaties operating solely on the international plane. This is illustrated by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, {{in which it was}} held that for the court to assume jurisdiction in such areas would be an [...] "exorbitant arrogation of adjudicative power", as the court could not presume that its ruling would bind other states. Another non-justiciable area is where the legislature <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a particular question is reserved to the executive to answer, as in Singapore Airlines which noted that section18 of the State Immunity Act requires those claiming sovereign immunity from lawsuits to first obtain certification from the Singapore Government.

[...] At the time Scally stated that he anticipated the club moving within four years, but by 2007 the proposed date had been pushed back to 2010. In March 2017, he again identified Mill Hill, on the east of the A289 Yokosuka Way, as his preferred site for a new stadium, re-iterated that this was necessary for the club to have ambitions of future Premier League football, and that he would be launching a bond scheme to fund {{the early stages of the}} development.|$|E

Despite this, DJ Shadow <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about {{as a result of the}} album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool."

2500|$|Petrosian placed {{fifth in}} the 1953 Candidates Tournament, a result which marked the {{beginning}} of a stagnant period in his career. He seemed content drawing against weaker players and maintaining his title of Grandmaster rather than improving his chess or making an attempt at becoming World Champion. This attitude was illustrated by his result in the 1955 USSR Championship: out of 19 games played, Petrosian was undefeated, but won only four games and drew the rest, with each of the draws lasting twenty moves or less. Although his consistent playing ensured decent tournament results, it was looked down upon by the public and by Soviet chess media and authorities. Near the end of the event, journalist Vasily Panov wrote the following comment about the tournament contenders: [...] "Real chances of victory, besides Botvinnik and Smyslov, up to round 15, are held by Geller, Spassky and Taimanov. I deliberately exclude Petrosian from the group, since from the very first rounds the latter <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he is playing for an easier, but also honourable conquest—a place in the interzonal quartet." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{makes it}} clear that though the {{architectural}} mnemonic with its buildings, niches and three-dimensional images was a major theme of the art as practiced in classical times, it often employed signs or notae and sometimes even non-physical imagined spaces. During the period of migration of barbarian tribes and the transformation of the Roman empire the architectural mnemonic fell into disuse. However the use of tables, charts and signs appears to have continued and developed independently. Mary Carruthers <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a trained memory occupied a central place in late antique and medieval pedagogy, and has documented some {{of the ways in which}} the development of medieval memorial arts was intimately intertwined with the emergence of the book as we understand it today. Examples of the development of the potential inherent in the graphical mnemonic include the lists and combinatory wheels of the Majorcan Ramon Llull. The Art of Signs (Latin Ars Notoria) is also very likely a development of the graphical mnemonic.
