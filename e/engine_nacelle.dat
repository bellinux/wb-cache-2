5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle,</b> offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|E-767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) {{platform}} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces; it is essentially the Boeing E-3 Sentry mission package on a 767-200ER platform. E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system, <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle,</b> airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E

40|$|An {{empirical}} method for integrating the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> on a wing-fuselage-fin(s) configuration has been described. This method {{is based on}} Whitham theory and Seebass and George sonic-boom minimization theory, With it, both reduced sonic-boom as well as high aerodynamic efficiency methods {{can be applied to}} the conceptual design of a supersonic-cruise aircraft. Two high-speed civil transport concepts were used as examples to illustrate the application of this engine-nacelle integration methodology: (1) a concept with <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> mounted on the aft-fuselage, the HSCT- 1 OB; and (2) a concept with <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> mounted under an extended-wing center section, the HSCT- 11 E. In both cases, the key to a significant reduction in the sonic-boom contribution from the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> was to use the F-function shape of the concept as a guide to move the nacelles further aft on the configuration...|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E

5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E

25|$|When the Merlin {{engine was}} removed it was {{discovered}} that the fuselage cross section was virtually identical to that of the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> of a Messerschmitt Bf-110G. Consequently, a new engine support structure was built onto the Spitfire's fuselage and the DB 605 engine and cowling panels added. A propeller unit and supercharger air intake from a Bf 109 G completed the installation.|$|E
25|$|It was {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by a}} fatigue crack in the main spar of the left wing that caused the outer part of the left wing, outboard of the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle,</b> to separate from the remainder of the aircraft.

25|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} sharp crack followed by cessation of {{noise from the}} engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. Moments later the wreckage struck the ground and a pall of black smoke rose into the air. Part of the left wing, outboard of the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle,</b> continued to drift down slowly and reached the ground about ¾mile (1.2km) from the main wreckage.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, an {{improved}} {{version of the}} aircraft, marketed as the TBM 900 was introduced, featuring 26 individual modifications, including the adoption of in-house-designed winglets, a redesigned air intake and the fitting of a five-blade Hartzell-built propeller, orientated around delivering improved aerodynamics and performance. The adoption of a sharp strake, located forward and beneath {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, also provides for improved stall characteristics over the earlier TBM variants. According to aircraft publication Aviation Week, various subtle exterior changes were made for drag reduction purposes, including the addition of inner main landing gear doors, the re-contouring of the tail cone and of the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Operational {{use of the}} G.IV {{demonstrated}} that the incorporation of the fuel tanks into the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> was a mistake. In a crash landing the tanks could rupture and spill fuel onto the hot engines. This posed a serious problem because landing accidents caused 75% of operational losses. In response Gothaer produced the G.V, which housed its fuel tanks inside the fuselage. The smaller <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> were mounted on struts above the lower wing.|$|R
