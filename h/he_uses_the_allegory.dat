Instead he views the soul as a sort of composite, in which many different elements blend together and affect each other. <b>He</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> of the charioteer to explain that love is a reflection of love of the forms, and is thus a [...] "divine madness," [...] a theia mania.|$|E
50|$|Very importantly, Bankim Chandra boldly {{portrayed the}} {{struggle}} {{being led by}} a woman, the protagonist, {{in a time when}} most women remained behind purdah and did not even show her face to men apart from her husband and siblings. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> of actual historical figures of valiant queens across India who had ably led their kingdoms and fought on battlefields. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists see the ending as a disappointment however, because the protagonist preferred to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement, and even asserted that to be the only fulfilment of a woman.|$|R

50|$|Literary {{scholars}} and historians {{have begun to}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-Restoration England, claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy. Warren also argues that English poet John Milton “can {{be seen as an}} early critic of transitional justice,” <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> of Sin and Death in his epic poem Paradise Lost to complicate “overly-rosy” depictions of transitional justice.|$|R

40|$|The article aims {{to examine}} the articulations between writing {{and the process of}} {{addressing}} in psychoanalysis. Observing the field of transmission of experience, the authors propose the testimony through writing as a possible path for the addressing of the singular aspect of memories from a subject towards the Other, changing the classical notion of history based on the difference between fiction and reality, truth and accuracy. With that in mind, the article discusses the relationship between the message and its destination, <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> proposed by Jacques Lacan through the detective story The Purloined Letter, by Edgar Allan Poe. Based on the developments extracted by Lacan, we seek to understand, along with the circulation movement of the letter, exactly what is transmitted in the field of the words when a message is in circulation...|$|R

5000|$|The Cuban {{government}} of the República de Cuba issued stamps from its inception in 1902 until Fidel Castro assumed control on January 1, 1959. The first issue was on September 30, 1902. There were no stamps yet printed by Cuba, but they had many of <b>the</b> little <b>used</b> 3¢ <b>allegory</b> stamps of 1899. They choose to overprint these stamps to meet the 1¢ postal rate demand by overprinting a large numeral [...] "1" [...] on each stamp with the legend [...] "UN CENTAVO" [...] "HABILITADO" [...] and [...] "OCTUBRE 1902". Cubans continued to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> stamps of 1899. In 1905, {{four of the five}} regular rate allegory stamps were reprinted for Cuba in the United States, but this time the printer made minute changes in each of the stamps before the reprint so as to make them distinguishable.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores recent {{critiques of}} aid and {{responses}} to them, with a particular focus on attempts to address accountability concerns. It describes, with particular reference to Africa and Melanesia, some of the assumptions that underpin these responses. <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> of theatre, we suggest {{that much of the}} formal process of interaction between aid agencies and local actors {{can be seen as a}} ‘performance’, and what goes on behind the scenes is often, and sometimes deliberately, ignored. We review why this ‘theatre’ is constructed and how it is maintained, as well as why attempts to dismantle it, or at least change the way it functions, have not met with much success. As a result, we propose alternative ways of addressing issues of accountability, as it relates to International Aid and Cooperation, based on some rather different assumptions about states, civil society, citizens and change than those upon which many of the current attempts to address accountability are based...|$|R
40|$|The “Allegory of the Cave, ” Book VII of Plato’s Republic, {{has been}} a staple in Western {{philosophical}} and political thought for millennia. Following a brief summary of Plato’s story told by Socrates, this article makes a case for <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> {{as a framework for}} discussing the systems of oppression created by colonialism and hegemonic control. The second part of this article discusses the ways in which Plato’s vision has been used in educational philosophy and psychology to symbolize the gradual processes of education as a means of liberation. This discussion takes the form of an analysis of Platonic developmental processes of cog-nition and reasoning in comparison to self-authorship and self-evolution theories of Baxter Magolda (2001, as cited in Evans, Forney, Guido, Patton, & Renn, 2010), and Egan (1983). Additionally, this article offers a connection between Platonic philosophy and Heidegger’s theories of ontological education to inform student affairs practice. Finally, Plato’s pedagogy and the work of Paulo Freire (1998) present critica...|$|R
5000|$|Allegory has {{an ability}} to freeze the temporality of a story, while infusing it with a spiritual context. Mediaeval {{thinking}} accepted allegory as having a reality underlying any rhetorical or fictional <b>uses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>allegory</b> was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull Unam Sanctam (1302) presents themes of the unity of Christendom with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: [...] "Therefore of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads {{as if it were}} a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they necessarily confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ." [...] This text also demonstrates <b>the</b> frequent <b>use</b> of <b>allegory</b> in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.|$|R

In the Information Systems (IS) domain, a debate has recently emerged on the chance to implement alternative genres to generate unconventional ways of looking at IS-related issues.

To exemplify <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> genre, <b>the</b> study tackles the role of the action researcher to enable user engagement and change management in the early phases of Information Systems implementation. <b>The</b> <b>allegory</b> is applied to the case of a Small- Medium-Enterprise undergoing ERP implementation.

40|$|In allegory, {{language}} is broken up, dispersed, {{in order to}} acquire a new and intensified meaning in its fragmentations. This dissertation breaks up four texts and disperse {{them in order to}} obtain new and intensified meaning of Gustave Courbet's Allégorie Réelle. <b>The</b> <b>Allegory,</b> in this study, changes according to the author who treats it. In new art history, the attention is redirected to the reader. The focus is less on the questions of the biography and on the intentions of the artist, but rather on questions of who the artist is for the each reader. This dissertation puts forward an interpretation of four studies of Gustave Courbet's The Painter’s Studio, A Real Allegory Summing up Seven Years of my Artistic and Moral Life (1855) within New Art History. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare how Linda Nochlin, James H. Rubin, Michael Fried and Petra ten-Doesschate Chu handle allegory. Rubin’s aim is to show the allegorist as the interpreter of “reappropriated” cultural imagery that in his hands becomes something else. For Chu, as for Rubin, <b>the</b> aim of <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> is to reappropriate imagery, but in her study, it is in order to act as index for repression and freedom. Nochlin’s aim is to show <b>allegory</b> as <b>the</b> model of textuality where the transgression of the Law is not effected in the body of women. Finally, Fried found in <b>the</b> <b>allegory</b> a commitment to percep¬tion, thus finding the authenticity as painting not only in painting. My analysis of these texts goes beyond summarizing each essay in which the art historians discuss the painting. It is to show how, when a painting is treated as a text, language provides multiple possibilities to achieve understanding. It is my intention to understand the theories and methodologies that the art historians, that I have chosen to study, use in order to read <b>the</b> real <b>allegory...</b>|$|R
