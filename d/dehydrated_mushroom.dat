40|$|Five {{species of}} edible mushrooms, Lentinula edodes, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pholiota nameko, Macrolepiota bonaerensis and Agaricus blazei, were tested for their {{potential}} to inhibit the in vitro {{growth of the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Only L. edodes had a fungistatic effect on this human pathogen. The inhibitory compound was produced intra and extracellularly in submersed L. edodes culture, and was also present in fresh and <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushroom</b> basidiocarps. The fungistatic compound was heat sensitive and lost activity after 72 hours. Key words: mushrooms; antibiotics; candidiasis, fungistatic effect Candida albicans is a yeast present in the human gastrointestinal and genital-urinary tracts, and is very frequent among the infections caused by fungi in immunedepressed individuals, diabetics, and HIV carriers. In cases of endocrinopathies such as hypothireoidism, hypoadrenalism, and diabets, there {{is an increase in}} the predisposition to candidiasis attributed to the increase i...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the drying of fresh and osmotically <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and {{evaluate}} their qualities. The osmotic treatment was carried out at 20 °C with a 10 % w. w? 1 salt solution, 80 rpm agitation and 60 min immersion time. The mushrooms were dried in a vertical bed dryer with forced air-flow. An experimental design was applied to evaluate {{the influence of the}} temperature and air velocity on the drying constant, obtained according to an exponential model and on the colour difference between the dried and fresh samples. Using Response Surface Methodology, a condition was chosen to obtain the largest drying constants and smallest colour differences. The optimum conditions for the drying process were 70 °C and 2. 0 m/s, and 80 °C and 2. 5 m/s for fresh and osmotically <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> respectively. The dried mushrooms presented â-glucan content values of 6. 14 ± 0. 55 and 6. 77 ± 0. 47 g. 100 g? 1 d. b under the optimised drying conditions. Osmotically dehydrated samples showed a slower re-hydration rate and smaller water activity than samples without pre-treatment. 200...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this experiment, {{tryptamine}} {{is used as}} a psilocin analog and is dispersed onto a Fisher brand cellulose laboratory sponge {{to simulate}} <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> The resulting “mushroom ” material is ground, molded into chocolate, and presented to student groups for real-world and applied analyses. Students isolate the tryptamine from the chocolate using their knowledge of drug chemistry, solubility, pH, extractions, etc. Qualitative analysis is conducted by comparison to standards (Thin Layer Chromatography or Gas Chromatography) and quantitative analysis is conducted by Gas Chromatography using the method of internal standards...|$|R
40|$|Button {{mushroom}} (Agaricus bisporus) slices as well {{as whole}} mushrooms were dried by microwave-vacuum drying technique to a moisture content of around 6 %(d. b.). The <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were compared with hot-air dried products {{on the basis of}} different quality attributes such as colour, texture, rehydration ratio and sensory score. Statistical analysis of data revealed significant difference among the drying methods for all the attributes at p ≤ 0. 05. Microwave-vacuum dried mushrooms had significantly higher rehydration potential, lower density, better colour and softer texture than those obtained by air drying. The microwave-vacuum dried mushrooms were rated much better than air dried products by a sensory panel in terms of appearance, color and overall acceptability...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to model the drying {{kinetics}} of mushrooms under several operational conditions, to evaluate the effective diffusivity coefficient of moisture removing by a drying model and inverse calculus method in finite differences and to study {{the effect on the}} final quality of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Different ways of microwave vacuum drying were compared to freeze-drying. Results show that a decrement of the applied pressure produces a certain increase in the drying rate together with a lower moisture in the dehydrated product at the end. Temperature control inside the sample helps to ensure a better quality in the dehydrated product, than when controlled at the surface. Diffusivity coefficients show a correspondence with product temperature during drying. The microwave dried samples obtained with moderate power and temperature control of product shown an important degree of quality similar to that obtained by freeze-drying.

40|$|The {{antimutagenic}} {{effect of}} the mushrooms Lentinula edodes and Agaricus blazei was studied on conidia of Aspergillus nidulans when exposed to short wave ultraviolet light. Two strains of A. nidulans were used. For {{the preparation of the}} extracts, the fresh mushrooms were left in aqueous infusion for 12 hours and heated in a water bath for 15 min at 100 ºC, and then the material was filtered. The <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were left in aqueous infusion for 12 hours and to filtrated. Both filtrates were used as extracts. A. nidulans conidia were incubated for three hours in water and in mushroom extracts and only after were exposed to UV light (pre-treatment). A. nidulans conidia were suspended in water and in mushroom extracts and immediately submitted to UV light (post-treatment). Conidial suspension in water and in mushroom extracts but without exposure to the mutagenic agent were used as controls. After mutagenic treatment, it was observed an increase in the survival rate of the A. nidulans and a decrease in the percentage of morphologic mutants on conidia treated with mushroom extracts. Our results demonstrated the radioprotective and antimutagenic effect of L. edodes and A. blazei mushrooms on eukaryotic cells when exposed to UV radiation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{a leading}} cause of {{mortality}} in the United States as well as globally. Epidemiological studies show that regular fruit and vegetable consumption reduces CVD risk, in part, due to antioxidant activity and immunomodulation since oxidative stress and inflammation are features of atherogenesis. Accumulating evidence also shows that dietary fungi, viz., mushrooms, can protect against chronic disease by altering inflammatory environments such as those associated with CVD although most research has focused on specialty mushrooms. In this study, we tested the ability of both common and specialty mushrooms to inhibit cellular processes associated with CVD. Methods Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were incubated overnight with control media with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle (1 % v/v) or containing DMSO extracts of whole <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> (0. 1 mg/mL), which included Agaricus bisporus (white button and crimini), Lentinula edodes (shiitake), Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster), and Grifola frondosa (maitake). Monolayers were subsequently washed and incubated with medium alone or containing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 β (5 ng/mL) for 6 h to upregulate pro-atherosclerotic adhesion molecules (AM). AM expression was assayed by ELISA and binding of U 937 human monocytes pre-loaded with fluorescent dye was determined. Results White button mushrooms consistently reduced (p Conclusion These data provide evidence that dietary mushrooms can inhibit cellular processes such as adhesion molecule expression and ultimate binding of monocytes to the endothelium under pro-inflammatory conditions, which are associated with CVD. As a result, these findings support the notion that dietary mushrooms can be protective against CVD. </p...|$|R
30|$|Notably, also younger (P. conopilus), mature (the single fruiting {{bodies of}} Agaricus augustus, Pholiota spec. and Stropharia caerulea; one {{mushroom}} each of P. candolleana and S. commune, two mushrooms each of Panaeolus ater and Psathyrella atrolaminata, {{and a series}} of mushrooms of C. domesticus) or aging mushrooms (Conocybe tenera, one mushroom each of Agrocybe dura, Marasmius cohaerens and Panaeolus cinctulus) which were to different extend desiccated were successfully appointed in collecting spores in numbers of 104 – 106 in plastic lids by reversed incubation on wet paper tissue (Table  2; Fig.  2 b). The shrivelled mushrooms refreshed in shape by taking up humidity from the wet paper tissue. For A. dura, we had an older dry fruiting body and young fresh mushrooms. Spore harvests were similar (2.6  ×  106 spores versus from 2.0 to 3.5  ×  106 spores). Spore numbers for <b>dehydrated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> of C. domesticus were only somewhat reduced (0.9  ±  0.1  ×  106; Fig.  2 b) as compared to most mushrooms harvested in fresh stage (4.1  ±  1.8 1  ×  106; Table  2). Moreover, mushrooms of the durable species S. commune which were dried on purpose at RT for 15  days gave still considerable numbers of spores in lids (5.6  ±  0.8  ×  104; n =  3; tested with the water agar system) over the 18  h of reversed incubation although these were 100 × reduced as compared to mushrooms which were used directly at the day of harvest (Table  1). S. commune in active phases produces continuously new spores (Kües and Navarro-Gonzaléz 2015) by which fresh mushrooms might distinguish from revived specimens that will require time for full physiological recovery.|$|R
