5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with <b>injectable</b> antibiotics may be impractical.

5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the <b>injectable</b> version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the <b>injectable</b> progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E

5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, <b>injectable</b> or implantable birth control, and condoms.

In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.|$|E
5|$|Some {{germanium}} compounds {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed <b>injectable</b> solutions.

He also meets Rogério, an <b>injectable</b> drugs user committed by his family, who tells him {{it is impossible to}} escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with haloperidol or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a conversation in which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of a HPLC and UV spectrophotometric methods to quantify cefuroxime sodium in <b>injectables.</b> HPLC analysis were carried out using a C 18 Wat 054275 column and a mobile phase composed of methanol and water (70 : 30), with a flow rate of 0. 8 mL/min and UV detection at 280 nm. For the spectrophotometric analysis, water was used as solvent and the wavelength of 280 nm was selected for the detection.

5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus <b>injectable</b> vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release <b>injectable)</b> as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

25|$|Use of {{ondansetron}} {{has been}} associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any patient with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the <b>injectable</b> (intravenous) form of the drug, and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in patients taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of <b>injectable</b> ondansetron should not exceed 16mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.)

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} antioxidant {{status of}} women on four different methods of contraception. Methodology: Sixty non-pregnant women aged 16 - 45 years on oral contraceptive pills, <b>injectables,</b> Norplant and intra-uterine contraceptive devices (IUD) attending the Family Planning Clinics of the University College Hospital (UCH) and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan were recruited for the study. Fifty-eight apparently healthy women aged 16 - 45 years who were not on any contraceptive served as a control group. The body mass index (BMI) of all participants (subjects and controls) was determined following standard protocol. Serum levels of ascorbic acid, tocopherol, malondialdehyde, bilirubin, creatinine, uric acid, total protein and albumin were determined using standard spectrophotometric methods. Progesterone was estimated by the chemilumiscence method while selenium was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Results: The BMI was significant in women on oral contraceptive pills (OCP) {{when compared to the}} control group (P 0. 05) in intra-uterine device (IUD), <b>injectables</b> and Norplant users. The mean serum ascorbic acid (P 0. 05) in users of other contraceptive methods. Serum levels of malondialdehyde was significantly elevated in women on OCP (P 0. 05) in users of other contraceptive methods. There was no significant association between progesterone and antioxidants in women on OCP, IUD, <b>injectables</b> and Norplant. Conclusion: Oral contraceptive pills showed a significant decreasing effect on the antioxidant status of its users while IUD, <b>injectables</b> and Norplant did not indicate any significant effect.
