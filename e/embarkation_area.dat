2500|$|Southampton was at {{the heart}} of Area C, a huge {{marshalling}} area in southern Hampshire, which extended as far north as Winchester. Detailed maps of the time show that within Area C, Sub area Z extended around the north of Southampton and as far as Hedge End in the east. There were military camps on the common, Harefield, Thornhill, and Netley Common. The maps even show that there were Chemical Warfare dumps to the north of the town.The town centre, the docks, Woolston and Weston were part of <b>Embarkation</b> <b>Area</b> C5. The plan was that troops and equipment would be assembled in the camps in sub-areas W, X, Y and Z then brought to the <b>embarkation</b> <b>area</b> to be loaded aboard the ships that were waiting there. That plan was tested in May 1944, during Operation Fabius, with troops that passed through Southampton rehearsing their landings at Hayling Island, Bracklesham Bay and Littlehampton ...|$|E

5000|$|At the time, Compostela was an incongruous {{mixture of}} wooden-roofed houses {{concentrated}} along the Agusan River which was properly known as [...] "dungguanan" [...] (<b>embarkation).</b> This <b>area</b> later became its center {{of trade and}} commerce or Poblacion.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{carried the}} working title [...] "The Mutiny" [...] and had {{antagonist}} Greg Sanderson originally named 'Sandor'. A sequence showing Verdeschi and Carter coordinating the personnel and equipment evacuation from two <b>Embarkation</b> <b>Areas</b> was dropped before filming. [...] Filmed but {{removed from the}} final cut {{was the end of}} the epilogue. After revealing that the two men are looking at pin-up girls, the viewer would have seen Maya transform into the last model to be pictured (portrayed by actress Venicia Day) and walk enticingly across the room. Verdeschi would then humorously have to stop Carter from chatting her up. Also cut for time was exposition about the waste-disposal site. Koenig would have informed Maya that these old nuclear-waste silos were designated Storage Area B-7 and had been set up in the 1980s.|$|R

On deck 5 of the vessel is a 500 m promenade, the longest in Costa’s fleet. Costa Diadema also has three swimming pools, {{one of which is}} covered by a retractable roof and also functions as a party space.|$|E

50|$|Medical Computer alerts Helena of Cellini's {{elevated}} {{pulse and}} metabolic rate. When she contacts him, he assures {{her that it}} was just a bad dream. Though not entirely convinced, she bids him a good night. Still in his pyjamas, Cellini leaves his quarters and makes for the <b>Embarkation</b> <b>Area.</b> His entry into this restricted area while off-duty attracts attention: John Koenig, overseeing the night shift in Main Mission, receives the report from Computer. Suspicious, the Commander orders Cellini's commlock cancelled.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bulk}} of the {{invasion}} force had embarked, 126 Rgt's batteries were trained at Larkhill Camp in engaging unseen ground targets. Ordered to its <b>embarkation</b> marshalling <b>area</b> in August, the regiment was diverted to Pevensey, Hove and Bexhill-on-Sea to engage incoming V-1 flying bombs as part of Operation Diver.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many Disney dark rides {{that feature}} {{separate}} <b>embarkation</b> and debarkation <b>areas,</b> the Great Movie Ride {{had only a}} single combined unloading and loading area. The last people to exit the vehicles often passed the next group of guests waiting to board the vehicles. At the time the ride was designed (the mid to late 1980s), it was common throughout the theme park industry to have all major rides exit into a store selling merchandise associated with the attraction. The Great Movie Ride, however, did not exit directly into a store and instead allowed guests to directly exit back outside into the park.|$|R
50|$|They leave, but Pasc drags Etrec {{toward the}} <b>Embarkation</b> <b>Area</b> instead. The {{transmitter}} was active—their people {{know they are}} free. They must flee before any Archanon officials arrive. Intending to steal the stand-by Eagle, Pasc knocks out the pilot, hiding his body in a storeroom. While waiting for their patients, Helena and Nuñez review their findings. A virus exists in both Archanons' systems—active in Pasc, dormant in Etrec. Perhaps not coincidentally, recordings of Pasc's brain waves show a series of distortions not present in the boy's. Blood samples are required for further analysis.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 August 1943 {{military}} {{restrictions were}} introduced to facilitate a [...] "military exercise" [...] prior to the invasion of Europe and D-Day in 1944. The southern parts of Woolston were explicitly listed by the Chief Constable (6 August 1943) {{as one of the}} areas that would be affected by the exercise. The exercise named Harlequin tested the port of Southampton's capacity for embarking troops and equipment. For the next 9 months Woolston saw a great deal of military activity. It became part of the huge military camp that was established in Hampshire, known as Area C, specifically part of <b>embarkation</b> <b>area</b> C5.|$|E

Due to its better conditions as a natural port, Puerto Pirámides became the <b>embarkation</b> <b>area.</b> In July 1900, the National Congress granted Piaggio a concession to build a 34-km. narrow gauge railway line from Puerto Pirámides to the salt ponds, known as Salinas Grandes. Concession -given by Law N° 3.898- stated that the line would not receive neither subsidies nor guarantees from the state, committing Piaggio to begin works within {{two months after the}} project was approved. The rail line would also be finished within a year. The Law also cleared that construction materials for the line could be imported duty-free for 20 years. Likewise the concessionary should provide electrical telegraph and telephones to the stations during the first years of concession.|$|E
