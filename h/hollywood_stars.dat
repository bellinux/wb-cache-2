5|$|As a Phillie, Hansen {{assumed the}} closer's role at times from 1950 National League Most Valuable Player Jim Konstanty, and worked nearly {{exclusively}} from the bullpen after being an occasional starting pitcher with New York. After tying his career high with five victories in 1952, Hansen went winless in 1953 {{and had a}} short tenure with the minor-league <b>Hollywood</b> <b>Stars</b> before retiring and beginning a 31-year career with the United States Postal Service.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars</b> {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E

5|$|Reinforcing Presley's {{image as}} a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars</b> and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, {{and most of these}} relationships were insubstantial.|$|E
5|$|Sunday {{was welcomed}} into {{the circle of}} the social, economic, and {{political}} elite. He counted among his neighbors and acquaintances several prominent businessmen. Sunday dined with numerous politicians, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and counted both Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as friends. During and after the 1917 Los Angeles campaign, the Sundays visited with <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars,</b> and members of Sunday's organization played a charity baseball game against a team of show business personalities that included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars</b> to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars,</b> commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Hansen was {{assigned}} to the Pirates-affiliated <b>Hollywood</b> <b>Stars,</b> an Open-classification minor league team based in Los Angeles. He appeared in three games, accumulating a 1.35 ERA on the mound and one hit in three at-bats at the plate. In one of those contests, he and Red Munger combined to hold the rival Los Angeles Angels to a 1–0 shutout. After being voted outstanding player of the week for his short tenure, Hansen voluntarily retired himself a second time after Pittsburgh Pirates president Branch Rickey refused to pay him $750 ($ today) that he was owed. The Pirates sent him a contract to play for the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans, along with a paycheck, but he did not report, opting to remain retired.|$|E
5|$|Linde spent 1949 {{with the}} San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He tried {{to earn a}} spot with the Indians during spring {{training}} but was unable to.

He finished the season with a 14–15 record in 35 pitching appearances (32 starts), a 4.41 ERA, 105 strikeouts, and 226⅓ innings pitched. He brought the Padres to the playoffs, and pitched in game six of the championship against the <b>Hollywood</b> <b>Stars,</b> where he earned the 8–4 loss as the Stars won the PCL pennant and the Governors' Cup.|$|E

5|$|Festivals, both {{national}} and Islamic, are celebrated in Marrakesh {{and throughout the}} country, {{and some of them}} are observed as national holidays. Cultural festivals of note held in Marrakesh include the National Folklore Festival, the Marrakech Festival of Popular Arts (in which a variety of famous Moroccan musicians and artists participate), and the Berber Festival. The International Film Festival of Marrakech, which aspires to be the North African version of the Cannes Film Festival, was established in 2001. The festival, which showcases over 100 films from around the world annually, has attracted <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars</b> such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Susan Sarandon, Jeremy Irons, Roman Polanski and many European, Arabic and Indian film stars. The Marrakech Bienniale was established in 2004 by Vanessa Branson as a cultural festival in various disciplines, including visual arts, cinema, video, literature, performing arts, and architecture.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars</b> Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' {{entry into}} the Second World War, Cameron {{signed up for the}} Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, a part of the United States Navy, in February 1943. Initially sent to a {{training}} camp at Iowa State Teachers College in Cedar Falls, she was subsequently posted to Washington D.C., where she served as a cartographer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the course of these duties, she met U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in May 1943. She was reassigned to the Naval Photographic Unit in Anacostia, where she worked as a wardrobe mistress for propaganda documentaries, and during this period met various <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars.</b> When her brother James returned to the U.S. injured from service overseas, she went AWOL and returned to Iowa to see him, as a result of which she was court–martialed and confined to barracks {{for the rest of the}} war. For reasons unknown to her, she received an honorable discharge from the military in 1945. To join her family, she traveled to Pasadena, California, where her father and brothers had found work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).|$|E

5|$|In February 1946, Mutual {{introduced}} a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run {{for more than}} seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars,</b> the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour. The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major <b>Hollywood</b> <b>stars,</b> to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E
