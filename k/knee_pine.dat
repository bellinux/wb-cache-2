40|$|Wounded <b>Knee,</b> <b>Pine</b> Ridge, the Ghost Dance are all {{phrases that}} invoke, {{perhaps more than}} any others, the senseless, {{prolonged}} acts of atrocity against Native Americans. The story of the events, peoples, and places unfolds on a bleak wintry landscape of the Northern Plains {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Scholars tell and retell this story, pondering the causes and failed communications, often seeking explanations or rationalizations for the assault on Sioux men, women, and children that took place in South Dakota leaving more than 250 dead. Storytellers, poets, and screenwriters employ the frozen, barren landscapes of the Northern Plains and the terrible history of our government 2 ̆ 7 s failed relationship with Native Americans through the lens of the Wounded Knee massacre...|$|E

The members earned the trust of AIM and government authorities but were ousted from the reservation {{at the behest of}} Oglala Sioux Tribal Council chairman Dick Wilson, who believed the delegation to be pro-AIM. Although the role of the intermediaries diminished, they had successfully brokered cease-fires and convinced both sides that negotiations offered the best means of reaching their objectives...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} journalism career of Susette La Flesche Tibbles (Bright Eyes), a nineteenth-century Omaha Indian woman. She {{was the oldest}} {{daughter}} of Joseph La Flesche, Jr. (Iron Eye). Her father was metis, born of a French father and Ponca mother. Joseph La Flesche was the last chief of the Omaha tribe chosen in the traditional manner. Susette’s work as an Omaha Morning World-Herald reporter during the Ghost Dance trouble and Wounded <b>Knee</b> massacre at <b>Pine</b> Ridge Agency from December 1890 to January 1891, and from 1893 - 1895 as a writer for both the American Nonconformist and the Lincoln Independent, two Populist papers, has been overlooked. Her journalism career has been overshadowed by her collaboration with the Ponca chief Standing Bear following the United States ex. rel. Standing Bear v. Crook case in 1879, which determined that Native Americans had some constitutional rights {{that the government would}} acknowledge. Following this case she and others embarked on a lecturing mission to call attention to unfair treatment of Native Americans. Her journalism career has been either largely overlooked or totally ignored, as in a 1974 biography, in larger works about her influential and unique family, and even in scholarly works. Examining her time as a reporter for papers dealing with two very different subjects rounds out her personality and passions, and it also allows a glimpse into one second-generation mixed-blood woman’s experience in the 19 th century journalistic world.

50|$|The {{policy of}} President Nixon created a schism among Indian leadership. Radical urban {{groups such as}} the American Indian Movement (AIM) {{actively}} opposed the BIA. In 1972, AIM members occupied the BIA building in Washington, D.C. Once more showing the restraint of Alcatraz, the Nixon Administration negotiated with the AIM for their peaceful departure. The elected tribal leaders disagreed with the tactics of civil disobedience employed by AIM. They viewed AIM as a destructive organization, while AIM perceived tribal leaders as weak and unfit to provide substantial change. This conflict came to a head in 1973 when 200 members of AIM converged on Wounded <b>Knee</b> at the <b>Pine</b> Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The conflict at Wounded Knee led to the impeachment of the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) tribal chairman, Richard Wilson, who was considered corrupt by many elders and traditional members of the tribe, including those associated with AIM. Furthermore, AIM leaders disliked the existing tribal government because it had been established under the IRA of 1934. AIM took Wounded Knee at gunpoint and proclaimed an independent Sioux nation. In response, Richard Wilson threatened to invade Wounded Knee and violently eject all AIM members. U.S. Marshals, FBI agents, and BIA police were deployed to Pine Ridge Reservation to defuse the situation. However, the standoff would continue for another three months until negotiations between President Nixon's representative, Leonard Garment, and AIM leaders, Dennis Banks and Carter Camp, reached an agreement. The occupiers surrendered their arms in exchange for an investigation of Wilson's management of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Once more, the Nixon Administration had used restraint and patience in a potentially violent situation.|$|R
