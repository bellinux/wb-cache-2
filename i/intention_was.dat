40|$|The varying {{characteristics}} {{reflective of}} the actual diversity in how <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> conducted have found that <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> significantly better predictors of purchase behavior for existing products and for durable than for non-durable products. These results are remarkable because in practice, <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> often used to predict sales for new non-durable products and also that <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> better predictors of behaviors over short that over long time horizons. Branding is also important because it communicates a brand’s business proposition.

40|$|Matthew Babb {{offers a}} strikingly elegant {{argument}} for, and explanation of, the essential indexicality of intentional argument. His two key thoughts are that intentional action always involves <b>intentions,</b> and <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> essentially indexical. In particular, every <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> indexically about the agent whose <b>intention</b> it <b>is,</b> i. e. de se. In this paper, I set out two models on {{which at least}} some <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> not de se – they are impersonal – and I show that these models are compatible with the data Babb points to. I also set out some more data that an account of essential indexical cases ought to be responsive to. Its span suggests that the claim that all <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> de se, even if true, cannot be what explains {{what is going on}} in essential indexical cases involving intention...|$|R

30|$|Entrepreneurial <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> {{the feeling}} of having one’s {{organisation}} that is derived from personal and contextual factors Bird, (1998). Ajzen (1991) portrays {{that the decision to}} start a new firm is assumed to be planned for some time and thus preceded by an intention to do so. However, in some cases this <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> formed only shortly before the actual decision and in some cases the intention never leads to actual behaviour. Hence, entrepreneurial <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> assumed to predict individual’s choice to found their own firms. Psychological research shows that <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> a crucial predictor of subsequent planned behaviour (Bagozzi et al., 1989). Consequently, entrepreneurial <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> a decision to form a new business venture that is planned rather than being conditioned. An individual may have the potential of being entrepreneur because of own competency and self-efficacy but may not make the transition into entrepreneurship {{because of the lack of}} intention (Krueger Jr et al., 2000).|$|R

25|$|Statements {{of future}} <b>intention</b> <b>are</b> not {{generally}} actionable representations, so {{that someone who}} fails {{to carry out a}} stated <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> not making a misrepresentation. However, a misrepresentation of one's present <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> actionable. As Bowen LJ said in Edgington v Fitzmaurice, 'the state of a man's mind is just as much a fact as the state of his digestion.' So where Mr Edgington had bought shares after he heard the company was seeking capital to expand, but in reality it was to pay off debts, he was entitled to rescind his purchase.|$|R
5000|$|Understanding <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} be pivotal in {{understanding}} social contexts in numerous ways. First, acquiring an understanding of <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> important for development in that it helps children conceptualize how people and animals differ from objects. Much of behavior <b>is</b> caused by <b>intentions,</b> and understanding intentions helps to interpret these behaviors. Second, <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> integral {{to an understanding of}} morality. Children learn to assign praise or blame based on whether actions of others <b>are</b> intentional. <b>Intention</b> <b>is</b> also necessary to understand and predict the plans and future actions of others. Understanding the intentions and motives of others aids in the interpretation of communication, and the achievement of cooperative goals. Social, cognitive and developmental psychological research has focused on the question: How do young children develop the ability to understand other people’s behaviors and intentions? ...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in {{identifying}} the intentions of specific behaviors. We as a society also operate in that way because the same outcome or behavior can be considered acceptable had the <b>intentions</b> for it <b>been</b> good versus another time where the <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> bad and in that case it would be unacceptable. In a situation where a child is trying to help their parent clean and misplaces something accidentally, it is easily forgiven and is considered morally acceptable because his/her <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> good. However, if the child purposely hid the object so their parent would not find it, it is morally unacceptable because the <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> bad. Ultimately, it is the same situation and same outcome but the <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> different. At the age of 10-11 years children realize this concept and start justifying their actions and behaviors by weighing their intentions.|$|R
