As with other key atmospheric variables, the atmospheric {{moisture content}} depends on the <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> with the large scale transport of water vapour as latent heat one of the main redistribution mechanisms for the uneven radiative input from the sun. This <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> however, is not constant but changes in a predictable manner with time, varying cyclically with a period of 11 years. To asses the impact of the 11 -year solar cycle on drought, rationale was borrowed from the procedures used to estimate the storage capacity of a water supply reservoir. Regions of the Earth’s atmosphere were conceptualized as storage reservoirs filling and depleting the atmospheric moisture with time. The amount of moisture in the atmosphere was conceptualised as the supply, and the demand for atmospheric moisture content was equated to 99 % of the mean atmospheric moisture content for that region under a case where no cyclic solar radiation forcing exists. The required storage of our atmospheric reservoir is hence the largest volume of atmospheric water that will be needed to supply the demand during a drought period, so that the atmospheric reservoir is never empty.

40|$|Summary: The {{responses}} of microorganisms (viruses, bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and lichens) to selected factors of space (microgravity, galactic cosmic <b>radiation,</b> <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation,</b> and space vacuum) were determined {{in space and}} laboratory simulation experiments. In general, microorganisms tend to thrive in the space flight environment in terms of enhanced growth parameters and a demonstrated ability to proliferate {{in the presence of}} normally inhibitory levels of antibiotics. The mechanisms responsible for the observed biological responses, however, are not yet fully understood. A hypothesized interaction of microgravity with radiation-induced DNA repair processes was experimentally refuted. The survival of microorganisms in outer space was investigated to tackle questions on the upper boundary of the biosphere and on the likelihood of interplanetary transport of microorganisms. It was found that <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> was the most deleterious factor of space. Among all organisms tested, only lichens (Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans) maintained full viability after 2 weeks in outer space, whereas all other test systems were inactivated by orders of magnitude. Using optical filters and spores of Bacillus subtilis as a biological UV dosimeter, {{it was found that the}} current ozone layer reduces the biological effectiveness of solar UV by 3 orders of magnitude. If shielded against solar UV, spores of B. subtilis were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).

Alternate techniques of deriving insolation data with high space-time resolution are discussed with reference to solar energy conversion requirements. Energy received on the ground can be computed from known values of the <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> spectrum and of the spectral absorption parameters of the atmosphere. Another technique is based on measurements made by meteorological satellites of the cloud-cover and of the solar energy reflected and scattered back to space by the earth-atmosphere system...|$|R

In this study, spatial and temporal patterns of monthly average daily solar radiation on a horizontal surface at the ground level were quantified using 130 climate stations for the entire Turkey and its conventionallyaccepted seven geographical regions through multiple linear regression (MLR) models as a function of latitude, longitude, altitude, aspect, distance to sea; minimum, maximum and mean air temperature and relative humidity, soil temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, pan evapotranspiration, day length, maximum possible sunshine duration, monthly average daily <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> and time (month), and universal kriging method. The resulting 20 regional best-fit MLR models (three MLR models for each region) based on parameterization datasets had R 2 adj values of 91. 5 % for the Central Anatolia region to 98. 0 % for the Southeast Anatolia region. Validation of the best-fit MLR models for each region led to R 2 values of 87. 7 % for the Mediterranean region to 98. 5 % for the Southeast Anatoli...|$|E

The computed results are compared with Sekera's obtained by means of Chandrasekhar's solution for the radiative transfer problem in a plane-parallel model of the earth's atmosphere {{with respect to the}} horizontal surface. The author's relative horizontal intensity resulting only from the primary scattering (i. e. in the unit of the <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> at the corresponding wavelength) has the same feature of dependency to the wavelength and solar zenith distance with the result given by Sekera. The author's relative horizontal intensity resulting from only the secondary scattering has also the same feature of dependency to the wavelength and solar zenithdistance with the result given by Sekera. The integrated relative horizontal global radiation for the whole range of wavelength is in good agreement witn Sekera's in the range of zenith distance 0 °～ 90 °, {{in such a way that}} one cannot discriminate both curves on the graph...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} evapotranspiration (PET) that would occur with unlimited plant {{access to water}} is a central driver of simulated plant growth in many ecological models. PET is influenced by solar and long wave radiation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity, but it is often modeled {{as a function of}} temperature alone. This approach can cause biases in projections of future climate impacts in part because it confounds the effects of warming due to increased greenhouse gases with that which would be caused by increased radiation from the sun. We developed an algorithm for linking PET to <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> (incoming top-of atmosphere solar radiation), as well as temperature and atmospheric water vapor pressure, and incorporated this algorithm into the dynamic global vegetation model MC 1. We tested the new algorithm for the Northern Great Plains, USA, whose remaining grasslands are threatened by continuing woody encroachment. Both the new and the standard temperature-dependent MC 1 algorithm adequately simulated current PET, as compared to the more rigorous PenPan model of Rotstayn et al. (2006). However, compared to the standard algorithm, the new algorithm projected a much more gradual increase in PET over the 21 st century for three contrasting future climates. This difference led to lower simulated drought effects and hence greater woody encroachment with the new algorithm, illustrating the importance of more rigorous calculations of PET in ecological models dealing with climate change...|$|E
40|$|In {{the space}} {{experiment}} ‘‘Molecular adaptation strategies of microorganisms to different space and planetary UV climate conditions’’ (ADAPT), bacterial endospores {{of the highly}} UV-resistant Bacillus subtilis strain MW 01 were exposed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and simulated martian surface conditions for 559 days on board the European Space Agency’s exposure facility EXPOSE-E, mounted outside the International Space Station. The survival of B. subtilis MW 01 spores from both assays (LEO and simulated martian conditions) was determined by a colonyformation assay after retrieval. It was clearly shown that <b>solar</b> <b>extraterrestrial</b> UV <b>radiation</b> (λ ≥ 110 nm) {{as well as the}} martian UV spectrum (λ ≥ 200 nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few spore survivors were recovered from B. subtilis MW 01 spores exposed in monolayers.

40|$|Abstract. Spores of Bacillus subtilis {{were exposed}} to space in the BIOPAN {{facility}} of the European Space Agency onboard of the Russian Earth-orbiting FOTON satellite. The spores were exposed either in dry layers without any protecting agent, or mixed with clay, red sandstone, Martian ana-logue soil or meteorite powder, in dry layers {{as well as in}} so-called ‘artificial meteorites’, i. e. cubes filled with clay and spores in naturally occurring concentrations. After about 2 weeks in space, their survival was tested from the number of colony formers. Unprotected spores in layers open to space or behind a quartz window were completely or nearly completely inactivated (survival rates in most cases ≤ 10 − 6). The same low survival was obtained behind a thin layer of clay acting as an optical filter. The survival rate was increased by 5 orders of magnitude and more, if the spores in the dry layer were directly mixed with powder of clay, rock or meteorites, and up to 100 % survival was reached in soil mixtures with spores comparable to the natural soil to spore ratio. These data confirm the deleterious effects of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> Thin layers of clay, rock or meteorite are only successful in UV-shielding, if they are in direct contact with the spores. The data suggest that in a scenario of interplanetary transfer of life, small rock ejecta of a few cm in diameter could be sufficiently large to protect bacterial spores against the intense insolation; however, micron-sized grains, as originally requested by Panspermia, may not provide sufficient protection for spores to survive. The data are also pertinent to search for life on Mars and planetary protection considerations for future missions to Mars...|$|R
50|$|Spore-forming {{bacteria}} {{are of particular}} concern {{in the context of}} planetary protection because their tough endospores may withstand certain sterilization procedures as well as the harsh environments of outer space or planetary surfaces. To test their hardiness on a hypothetical mission to Mars, spores of Bacillus subtilis 168 and Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 were exposed for 1.5 years to selected parameters of space. It was clearly shown that <b>solar</b> <b>extraterrestrial</b> UV <b>radiation</b> (λ ≥110 nm) as well as the Martian UV spectrum (λ ≥200 nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few survivors were recovered from spores exposed in monolayers. Spores in multilayers survived better by several orders of magnitude. All other environmental parameters encountered did little harm to the spores, which showed about 50% survival or more. The data demonstrate the high chance of survival of spores on a Mars mission, if protected against solar irradiation. These results will have implications for planetary protection considerations.|$|R
