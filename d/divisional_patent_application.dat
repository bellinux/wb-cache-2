5000|$|A <b>divisional</b> <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as a divisional application or simply a divisional) is a type of patent application which contains matter from a previously filed application (the so-called parent application). Whilst a divisional application is filed later than the parent application, it may retain its parent's filing date, and will generally claim the same priority.|$|E
5000|$|The {{practice}} and procedure of filing a <b>divisional</b> <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most countries, {{the filing of}} divisional applications is possible at least {{as long as the}} parent patent applications is pending. With a decision of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation of October 16, 2013, the European Patent Office rules will again be in line with the current practice before the patent offices in the U.S., Germany and Japan.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2013, the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation again amended Rules 36, 38 and 135 of the Implementing Regulations, which {{define the}} time limits for filing divisional {{applications}} in Europe. The new rules apply to divisional applications filed on or after April 1, 2014.

50|$|An {{innovation}} patent {{is granted}} automatically after a formalities check without substantive examination, however, infringement proceedings cannot be instituted {{unless and until}} the innovation patent has been certified, which requires a substantive examination. Examination cannot proceed until the innovation patent has been granted. Innovation patents have a maximum term of eight years subject to payment of annual renewal fees payable from {{the second anniversary of}} the date of filing. Innovation patents are available to persons outside Australia, but an Australian address for service must be provided. Innovation patent specifications must be prepared by a registered patent attorney unless the application proceeds as a Convention application or as a <b>divisional</b> <b>application.</b> Innovation <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> cannot proceed as national phase of an international <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> (see <b>Patent</b> Cooperation Treaty), but can proceed as a divisional application from an international <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> that is open to public inspection.|$|R

5000|$|As of December 31, 2014, the USPTO small-entity {{filing fee}} is $130 for {{provisional}} <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> having 100 or fewer pages of specification and drawings. Complexity involved for a provisional patent {{on the part}} of both the applicant and the USPTO is generally much less than that of a non-provisional <b>patent</b> <b>application.</b> Thus, it is possible to file a provisional <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> more quickly and cheaply than a non-provisional <b>patent</b> <b>application.</b>|$|R

40|$|We studied {{trends in}} genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> {{in order to}} {{identify}} the trends in the commercialization of research findings in genetics. To define genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications,</b> the European version (ECLA) of the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes was used. Genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> data from the PATSTAT database from 1990 until 2009 were analyzed for time trends and regional distribution. Overall, the number of <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> has been growing. In 2009, 152 [*] 000 <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> were submitted under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and within the EP (European Patent) system of the European Patent Office (EPO). The number of genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> increased until a peak was reached in the year 2000, with > 8000 applications, after which it declined by almost 50 %. Continents show different patterns over time, with the global peak in 2000 mainly explained by the USA and Europe, while Asia shows a stable number of > 1000 per year. Nine countries together account for 98. 9 % {{of the total number of}} genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications.</b> In The Netherlands, 26. 7 % of the genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> originate from public research institutions. After the year 2000, the number of genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> dropped significantly. Academic leadership and policy as well as patent regulations seem to have an important role in the trend differences.

5000|$|A <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> (i.e., the {{document}} which an applicant files {{with a view}} to initiating the <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> process) generally contains a description of the invention together with at least one claim purporting to define it.

Starting from July 16, 2006, Ms. A has then one year to file <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> in other countries to be able to benefit from the date of filing of the German <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> in these other countries. If Ms. A files on July 15, 2007 a <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> in the United Kingdom (UK) for her mousetrap, and if, upon filing the <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> in the United Kingdom, Ms. A claims the priority of the earliest German <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> filed one year before, the date for examining the novelty and inventive step requirements in the United Kingdom will be July 15, 2006, not July 15, 2007.|$|R

30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} of all the {{industries}} construction has a significant contribution to the increase in labor cost over time.

40|$|This {{research}} study is {{an analysis of}} <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> based on different input parameters.

30|$|In {{terms of}} Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), Daegu {{has the largest}} GRDP {{followed}} by Kwangju, Gumi, and Cheonan.
