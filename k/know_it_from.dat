25|$|The {{momentum}} equations {{are written}} {{primarily for the}} generic trajectory of a packet of flow travelling on a horizontal plane and taken at a certain elapsed time called t. The position of the packet {{is defined by the}} distance on the trajectory s=s(t) which it has travelled by time t. In reality, however, the trajectory is the outcome of the balance of forces upon the particle. In this section we assume to <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the start for convenience of representation. When we consider the motion determined by the forces selected next, we will have clues of which type of trajectory fits the particular balance of forces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{riddle of}} the early Academy is epitomized in the {{discrepancy}} between Aristotle's account of Plato's theory of ideas and that theory as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Plato's writings. To explain that discrepancy, scholars have constructed the hypothesis of an oral Platonic doctrine. I have tried to show that that hypothesis is unsatisfactory {{not only because the}} evidence for Plato's one attested lecture fails to support it, but also because the inconsistency in Aristotle's testimony itself appears to contradict it… ...|$|E
2500|$|While in {{hospital}} in 2008 after suffering serious head trauma, Kohl, then aged 78, married Maike Richter, a former Chancellery employee who was 44 years; {{they had no}} children. For the entire duration of this marriage, Kohl had a brain injury, was barely able to speak, and was wheelchair-bound. According to Helmut Kohl's son Peter Kohl, Helmut Kohl {{did not intend to}} marry Richter and had stated this clearly; [...] "then came the accident and a loss of control," [...] Peter Kohl said, suggesting that Richter had pressured his then seriously ill father into marrying her. Richter has been severely criticized in Germany, by Kohl's children, former friends and by German media. Following his new marriage, Kohl became estranged from his two sons and his grandchildren, and his sons said their father was kept [...] "like a prisoner" [...] by his new wife. His children and grandchildren were also prevented from seeing him by his new wife {{for the last six years}} of his life. In his biography of his mother, Peter Kohl wrote about the only time he had visited Richter's apartment, which he described as [...] "a kind of private Helmut Kohl museum" [...] full of Helmut Kohl photographs and artefacts everywhere; [...] "the whole thing looked like the result of a staggering, meticulous collecting for the purpose of hero worship, as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> reports on stalkers," [...] Kohl wrote. Jochen Arntz criticized Maike Richter in the Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2012 for building a [...] "wall" [...] around Helmut Kohl and controlling him; as a result he had also become estranged from many former friends disliked by his new wife. Kohl biographer Heribert Schwan describes Richter as [...] "more than conservative, rather German nationalist," [...] and said she insists on the right to [...] "interpretational sovereignty" [...] in relation to Kohl's life and that she has insisted on many proven falsehoods. It caused a scandal when Richter denied Kohl's sons and grandchildren entry to Helmut Kohl's house, the son's childhood home, after Kohl's death. Richter was also criticized for attempting to take full control of Kohl's funeral, and for trying to prevent Chancellor Merkel from speaking at the ceremony in Strasbourg. Richter wanted the controversial Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has fiercely criticized Merkel's refugee policies, to speak instead; she only relented when told it would cause a scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Hannah Montana 3 {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic, {{spoke of the}} album negatively, even more than Hannah Montana 2 and [...] On the review, Phares complains that the albums have not grown since the commence of the franchise by stating: [...] "Miley Cyrus was 13 {{years old when she}} started performing as Hannah Montana, but by the time Hannah Montana 3 was released, she was nearly 17. That's a pretty big span of time in a teenager's life, but you'd never <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> listening to these songs." [...] Another point which was brought by the reviewer was that the alteration from [...] "fizzy pop" [...] to [...] "searching ballads" [...] was too sudden. She described [...] "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)" [...] as [...] "extremely similar" [...] to Cyrus's own [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] which wasn't received well by critics and others were too [...] "equally cookie-cutter". To AllMusic the nadir of the album is [...] "Just a Girl". She mentioned [...] "the only thing worse than a big star singing about how fame has damaged her is a big child star singing about how fame has damaged her." [...] Overall she said: [...] "Hannah Montana 3 seems to give fans exactly what they want, but the calculation behind this music overwhelms the fun that used to be in it." [...] Warren Truit of About.com, looked at the album also from [...] "a preteen's point of view" [...] and taking into account that the songs are not supposed to represent her real life. Truit compared [...] "It's All Right Here" [...] and [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] to Shania Twain. He said the songs were a mix of Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett and Avril Lavigne with [...] "fizzy Radio Disney pop rock". They also felt [...] "Ice Cream Freeze" [...] was just as [...] "goofy" [...] as [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". As a summary he commented: [...] "When it comes down to it, the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack is harmless, poppy fun for preteen music fans. The tunes on the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack may be a little cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods, unlike the Jonas Brothers' recent genre-jumping mishmash disaster Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Hannah Montana devotees will absolutely love the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack, and parents can actually tolerate most of the songs on the album." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly, was also on a lighter and more positive perspective on the album. He said: ...|$|E
