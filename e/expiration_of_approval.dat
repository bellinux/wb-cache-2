40|$|Biosimilars are {{biological}} {{products that}} are the replicas of their innovator biopharmaceuticals. These are developed after patent <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> innovator biopharmaceuticals and are submitted for separate marketing <b>approval.</b> In view <b>of</b> the structural and manufacturing complexities of biopharmaceuticals, biosimilars {{should not be considered}} as “biological generics”. These are rather unique molecules with limited data at time <b>of</b> <b>approval,</b> so there are concerns about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars. This article will address the differences between biosimilars and chemical generics, issues of concern with the use of biosimilars and need of appropriate regulations for their approval...|$|R
