5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

5|$|When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 {{video of}} himself making 45 of 50 three point shots, Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later.

Curry had set the National Basketball Association single-season three pointers made record one week earlier. The following morning ESPN retweeted the video and noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row. A few hours later, when Stauskas woke up, {{he said he would}} look forward to such a contest. Soon Stauskas and Curry's representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN, but the contest would have been in violation of NCAA rules against competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking {{around the corner to}} find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E

5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114million viewers– {{more than the}} game itself, which had 111.3million viewers. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million). Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, {{with an average of}} 8,000 tweets per second for <b>five</b> <b>minutes)</b> <b>and</b> was the most-searched term on Google during the show.

5|$|He scored 14 {{goals in}} the 1970–71 campaign, the highest tally he ever recorded, {{including}} one in a 5–0 victory over Arsenal on 26 September that came third in the BBC Goal of the Season competition. The goal came after he played a one-two with Peter Dobing before striking a first-time shot into the net from 25-yards. Stoke reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time}} since 1899 in 1970–71, where they lost 2–0 to Arsenal after a replay; in the original tie Stoke had led 2–1 before conceding an equaliser five minutes into injury time. Conroy played in 19 of Stoke's 21 FA Cup and League Cup games in the 1971–72 season, as they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the League Cup. In the League Cup Stoke defeated Southport, Oxford United (after a replay), Manchester United (after two replays), Bristol Rovers and West Ham United (after two replays) to reach the Wembley final against Chelsea. Conroy was a key figure in the semi-final decider at Old Trafford against West Ham, as he won a penalty in the first half and then scored the winning goal on 49 minutes with a 25-yard volley. He also opened the scoring in the final itself, as he converted a simple header after <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> helped Stoke to go on to secure the first trophy in the club's history with a 2–1 victory. Stoke also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, again losing to Arsenal, though Conroy missed this game as he was sidelined for the rest of the season after he injured his cartilage again in a defeat to Leeds United on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountain}} Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall, just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The next day, Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio {{and took the}} race leader's pink jersey. His main rival at that point was Riccardo Riccò, who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall. Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16, and stayed out of trouble in Stages 17 and 18, stages where the contenders all finished together. The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks, {{but not enough to}} take the jersey from him. Di Luca found himself effected the next day, losing over <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> falling from contention, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial. Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro's finale, finishing 68th on the stage and losing close to two minutes to Contador, who was 11th. Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro, Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{cars were}} {{deployed}} {{to slow the}} race as marshals worked for twenty-two minutes to dry the spilled oil along the Mulsanne Straight. As the safety cars were recalled, Lotterer in the No. 7 Audi used slower traffic to pass both Porsche drivers {{in front of him}} and take over the race lead, just as Nico Hülkenberg moved to fourth place by passing the remaining Audi cars. In the LMP2 category the safety car had split the field up, leaving the TDS Racing and KCMG Oreca-Nissan cars forty seconds ahead of their class rivals. Richard Bradley for KCMG was able to fight with TDS Racing's Tristan Gommendy on the restart and eventually retake the class lead it had lost at the race start. Lotterer was later forced to give up the race lead as a puncture on one of the No. 7's tyres required an extra pit stop, allowing Hartley's No. 17 Porsche to the front of the race. Duval was caught on an approach to a slow zone (which was enforced to allow a marshal to retrieve debris at Indianapolis) by a group of slowed LMGTE cars and took avoiding action by steering right into the grass off track. The No. 8 Audi clipped the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari's right-hand section and was thrown back sideways across the track, impacting the outside barriers head on heavily driving into Indianapolis corner and ripping the car's front bodywork off. Safety cars were required once again as the barriers needed lengthy repairs, while Duval was able to drive the damaged Audi back to the garage. Repairs took less than <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> the car resumed in eighth place.|$|E
