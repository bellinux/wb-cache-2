5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent <b>indiscriminate</b> sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. <b>Indiscriminate</b> sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with <b>indiscriminate</b> behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

5|$|While {{employing}} anekāntavāda, the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya {{stated that}} it is not anābhigrahika (<b>indiscriminate</b> attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.

50|$|Agile Software Development {{is a set}} of {{software}} development methods that originated as a response for the <b>indiscriminated</b> use of CMMI, RUP and PMBOK creating fat and slow software development processes that normally increased the lead time, the work in progress and non-value added/value added activities ratio on projects. Agile software development methods include XP, Scrum, FDD, AUP, DSDM, Crystal, and others.|$|R

Many remain unnamed, deemphasizing their identities and highlighting Zeluco’s <b>indiscriminating</b> evildoing, but others command large sections of the text. The “sheer number of secondary characters {{and the range of}} subplots mean that Zeluco himself frequently disappears for large sections of the book and that interest in the central plot is diffused by an increasing focus on comic secondary characters.” ...|$|R

To evaluate actual environmental situation, its necessary to update natural resources studies, mainly water. Then, {{the objective of}} this work was evaluated the water quality in DF. The water quality in all points of water collection of Companhia de Água e Esgoto de Brasília (CAESB) in Distrito Federal were evaluated, using the Water Quality Index, in the last ten years. For each point there is an area for the environmental protection of water source. The standard water found in each point, were associated to the areas of environmental protection water source, by year, during winter and summer. It was possible to verify that the majority points have a water quality standard good. The water quality is worse during summer, that corresponds to the raining time. Three points presents water quality standard medium and bad: Mestre DArmas, Barrocão and Pipiripau. These areas have <b>indiscriminated</b> urban occupation and agricultural activities.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} an ecosystem in which spiders may be transported {{by the wind}} from vine-yards into the surrounding woods and vice versa. The model takes into account this tranport phenomenon without building space explicitly into the governing equations. The equilibria of the dynamical system are analyzed together with their stability, showing that bifurcations may occur. Then the effects of <b>indiscriminated</b> spraying to keep pests under control is also investigated via suitable simulations...|$|R

The book catalogued {{the environmental impacts of}} <b>indiscriminate</b> DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife. The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT spraying as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.|$|E
50|$|He {{is renowned}} for a {{research}} on the Nihonshoki. He divides the history book into two groups and claims that Group α (Vol. 14-21, 24-27, 30) was documented by native speakers of the Northern Chinese dialect during the Tang Dynasty while Group β (Vol. 1-13, 22-23, 28-29) was written by Japanese. He noticed that Group α is standard written Chinese and applies Chinese characters consistently to Japanese words, but Group β is Japanized Chinese and <b>indiscriminates</b> some characters that were distinguished in Northern Chinese.|$|R
60|$|Alas! Each day made me {{more and}} more the {{dissenter}} from accepted economic as well as literary conventions. I became less and less of the booming, <b>indiscriminating</b> patriot. Precisely as successful politicians, popular preachers and vast traders diminished in importance in my mind, so the significance of Whitman, and Tolstoi and George increased, for they all represented qualities which make for saner, happier and more equitable conditions in the future. Perhaps I despised idlers and time-savers unduly, but I was of an age to be extreme.|$|R

5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by <b>indiscriminate</b> trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, {{but they may be}} important for many cold-water species.|$|E

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its <b>indiscriminate</b> use.|$|E

60|$|No American {{can study}} the {{character}} and career of Abraham Lincoln without being carried away by sentimental emotions. We are always inclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind very unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment.

60|$|The benevolent propensities {{are thus}} {{inherent}} in the human mind. We are impelled to seek the happiness of others. We experience a satisfaction in being the authors of that happiness. Everything that lives is open to impressions or pleasure and pain. We are led by our benevolent propensities to regard every human being indifferently with whom we come in contact. They have preference only with respect to those who offer themselves most obviously to our notice. Human beings are <b>indiscriminating</b> and blind; they will avoid inflicting pain, though that pain should be attended with eventual benefit; they will seek to confer pleasure without calculating the mischief that may result. They benefit one {{at the expense of}} many.|$|R
