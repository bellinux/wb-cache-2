40|$|Mammals {{have ten}} voltage-dependent sodium (Nav) channel genes. Nav {{channels}} {{are expressed in}} different cell types with different subcellular distributions and are critical for many aspects of neuronal processing. The last common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods had four Nav channel genes, presumably on four different chromosomes. In the lineage leading to mammals, a series of tandem duplications on two of these chromosomes more than doubled the number of Nav channel genes. It is unknown when these duplications occurred and whether they occurred {{against a backdrop of}} duplication of flanking genes on their chromosomes or as an expansion of ion channel genes in general. We estimated key dates of the Nav channel gene family expansion by phylogenetic analysis using teleost, elasmobranch, lungfish, amphibian, avian, lizard, and mammalian Nav channel sequences, as well as chromosomal synteny for tetrapod genes. We tested, and exclude, the null hypothesis that Nav channel genes reside in regions of chromosomes prone to duplication by demonstrating the lack of duplication or duplicate retention of surrounding genes. We also find no comparable expansion in other voltage-dependent ion channel gene families of tetrapods following the teleost–tetrapod divergence. We posit a specific expansion of the Nav channel gene family in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods when tetrapods evolved, diversified, and invaded the terrestrial habitat. During this time, the amniote forebrain evolved <b>greater</b> <b>anatomical</b> <b>complexity</b> and novel tactile sensory receptors appeared. The duplication of Nav channel genes allowed for greater regional specialization in Nav channel expression, variation in subcellular localization, and enhanced processing of somatosensory input...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRadial {{access is}} the object of {{increasing}} interest for interventional cardiologists, providing several advantages, including a reduction of bleeding and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates. However, even though elderly patients have a greater risk of access site bleedings, the use of the radial approach is controversial, due to the <b>greater</b> <b>anatomical</b> <b>complexity</b> of these patients. MethodsRetrospective study including patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCIs) using the radial access divided into an elderly (> 65 years) and a non-elderly (< 65 years) group. Clinical, angiographic and procedural characteristics as well as early and late follow-up outcomes were analyzed. ResultsThe elderly group included 131 patients (145 PCIs) and the non-elderly group, 149 patients (176 PCIs). The elderly group presented lower body mass index and fewer smokers and higher rates of chronic renal failure, peripheral arterial disease, stable coronary artery disease, multivessel disease and calcified lesions. There was no difference in the rate of access-site crossover (4. 8 % vs. 3. 4 %), fluoroscopy time (15. 3 ± 10. 3 minutes vs. 16. 1 ± 10. 3 minutes), procedure time (40. 6 ± 26. 4 minutes vs 46. 4 ± 53. 6 minutes), angiographic (96. 3 % vs 97. 5 %) and clinical (94. 5 % vs 95. 4 %) success, MACE (3. 4 % vs 3. 4 %) and bleedings (0. 21 % vs 0. 6 %) during hospitalization. In the late follow-up {{there was no difference in}} the MACE rates (9. 6 % vs 11 %). ConclusionsDespite the greater clinical and angiographic complexity, PCI using the radial access is safe and effective, with a high procedural success rate and low in-hospital and late follow-up complication rates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Epicormic bud strands in Eucalyptus cladocalyx F. Muell. {{extended}} from the pith to the outer bark. In large-diameter stems (30 cm diameter, 2 cm bark thickness) the epicormic bud strands had their <b>greatest</b> <b>anatomical</b> <b>complexity</b> {{at the level of}} the vascular cambium. At this level the epicormic bud strand was about 3 mm wide × 5 mm high in transverse section and within it were 22 – 40 radially arranged strips of cells of meristematic appearance embed-ded in a mainly parenchymatous matrix. Well-developed buds with leaf primordia and vascular connections were never observed in intact trees, although when stimulated each meristem strip could produce numerous bud primordia. Toward the bark surface the epicormic bud strands became progressively simpler in structure. On the stem surface, the position of the epicormic bud strand was shown by a number of adjacent small protrusions which appeared to have no meristematic potential. From the outer secondary xylem to the pith the bud strand usually became slightly smaller in diameter and its cells, although nucleated, had thick lignified walls and the meristem strips were much reduced or were not present. In most previously investigated angiosperm tree genera epicormic shoots develop from suppressed buds embedded in the bark. Eucalyptus appears to be unique in that suppressed buds are not present in the bark and that each epicormic bud strand has the potential to form numerous bud primordia when stimulated to do so. © CSIRO 200...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCardiac {{tissue is}} always {{surrounded}} by conducting fluid, both in vivo (blood) and in experimental preparations (Tyrode's solution), which acts to increase conduction velocity (CV) {{close to the}} tissue-fluid interface, inducing transmural wavefront curvature. Despite its potential importance, computer modeling studies focused on arrhythmia mechanisms have previously not accounted for these bath-loading effects. Here, we investigate the increase in CV and concomitant change in transmural wavefront profiles upon both propagation and arrhythmia dynamics within models of differing <b>anatomical</b> <b>complexity.</b> In simplified slab models, in absence of transmural fiber rotation, bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature dominates, significantly increasing arrhythmia complexity compared to no bath. In the presence of fiber rotation, bath-loading effects are less striking and depend upon propagation direction: the bath accentuates natural concave curvature caused by transmurally rotating fibers, but attenuates convex curvature, which negates overall impact upon arrhythmia complexity. Finally, we demonstrate that {{the high degree of}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>complexity</b> within whole ventricular models modulates bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature. However, key is the increased surface CV that dramatically reduces both arrhythmia inducibility and resulting complexity by increasing wavelength and reducing the available excitable gap. Our findings highlight the importance of including bath-loading effects during arrhythmia mechanism investigations, which could have implications for interpreting and comparing simulation results with experimental data where such effects are inherently present...|$|R

Clustering techniques applied to the full population revealed a large number of distinct categories of task-phase-specific activity patterns.
