5|$|One of {{the most}} {{threatening}} features of the new North Vietnamese build-up was the air defence network that was established within South Vietnam, which by 1975 consisted of twenty-two regiments equipped with radar-controlled gun systems and formidable SA-2 Guideline and shoulder-launched SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles. Such systems posed a major deterrent to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum. This lack of active intelligence collection made estimation of North Vietnamese strength and intentions much more difficult.|$|E

Darlington is well equipped for injuries such as broken bones, severe abdominal pain which may require surgery, eye conditions and maternity and baby cases.

2500|$|Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy was {{implemented}} in 2006 and aimed to cut extreme poverty {{in half by}} 2015. Extreme poverty saw a low of 36.2 percent only {{two years after the}} implementation of the strategy but then increased to 66.5 percent by 2012. Poverty and inequality reduction can be attributed to rapid growth in combination with federal spending. Prior to the coup Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage. These efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup. When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012. This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with.|$|E

And finally, in countries where prostitution is legal or semi-legal, they can raise awareness amongst the clients of prostitution {{so that they can}} watch for signs of human trafficking victims.

2500|$|The Atlantic {{slave trade}} {{developed}} after trade contacts were established between the [...] "Old World" [...] (Afro-Eurasia) and the [...] "New World" [...] (the Americas). For centuries, tidal currents had made ocean travel particularly difficult and risky for the ships that were then available, {{and as such}} there had been very little, if any, maritime contact between the peoples living in these continents. In the 15th century, however, new European developments in seafaring technologies resulted in ships being better <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the tidal currents, and could begin traversing the Atlantic Ocean. Between 1600 and 1800, approximately 300,000 sailors engaged in the slave trade visited West Africa. In doing so, they {{came into contact with}} societies living along the west African coast and in the Americas which they had never previously encountered. Historian Pierre Chaunu termed the consequences of European navigation [...] "disenclavement", with it marking an end of isolation for some societies and an increase in inter-societal contact for most others.|$|E

2500|$|The city of Manchester {{experienced}} {{rapid growth}} during {{the eighteenth and}} nineteenth centuries, and the existing administrative bodies were not <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with such expansion. The area was managed by the Court Leet, which was responsible for all administration and judicial functions. In 1792, the Manchester and Salford Police Act led to the establishment of a day and night watch. [...] The night watch was mainly a guard against fire. At that time the word police was used to mean administration, rather than the handling of law and order. A group of Police Commissioners were established to manage cleansing and water supply. [...] In 1797, this was formalised, by creating separate Commissioners for Salford and for Manchester. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 paved the way for borough councils to be established, with ratepayers electing their members. A petition to create such a council for Manchester was organised by two industrialists, Richard Cobden and Thomas Potter, but this was resisted by both the Court Leet and the Police Commissioners, who stood to lose some of their powers.|$|E
