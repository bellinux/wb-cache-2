50|$|The <b>dial</b> of the Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing the <b>dial</b> mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's <b>dial</b> couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional <b>dial</b> phones, but instead has a button {{within each of the}} <b>dial's</b> number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the <b>dial</b> which stops the <b>dial</b> once it's turned to the <b>dial's</b> end position.|$|R
40|$|Seventy-five male college {{students}} and twenty$ve human engineering psychologists were given a question-naire presenting diagrams consisting of three concentrically ganged knobs and three <b>dials</b> which they were told the knobs operate. They were asked which <b>dial</b> they thought should be operated by {{each of the three}} knobs. Knobdial associations were ob taiued with <b>dials</b> in horizontal and vertical arrays above, below, to the left OX and {{to the right of the}} knobs, and wiih <b>dials</b> differing in size, shape and distance from the knob axis. Knob-dial associations were found to be influenced by all of thpse factors except <b>dial</b> shape. Associations which were both strong and relatively unrivaled were found for <b>dial</b> position in a horizontal array (except when the array is to the lefi of the knobs), and for <b>dial</b> size. Subjects associated the spatial knob progression, front knob to back knob with tlze spatial <b>dial</b> progression, left <b>dial</b> to right <b>dial</b> and with the <b>dial</b> size progression, smallest <b>dial</b> to largest <b>dial.</b> Strong, but strongly rivaled, associations were found for <b>dial</b> position in a vertical array and for <b>dial</b> distance from the knob axis...|$|R
5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the <b>dialing</b> sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the <b>dialing</b> remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the <b>dialing</b> computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantis DHD is {{more similar}} to the Earth's <b>dialing</b> {{computer}} than an actual DHD, and {{looks more like a}} set of crystal panels. It can block out certain gate addresses.

A similar DHD is also used on Puddle Jumpers, where the set of used glyphs corresponds to the galaxy of the Puddle Jumper.

However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium <b>Dial</b> Company was specifically set up to only paint <b>dials,</b> no other radium processing took place at the premises.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll <b>dialling)</b> is a telephone system allowing subscribers to <b>dial</b> trunk calls without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be <b>dialled</b> directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be <b>dialled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital <b>dial</b> phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> tone and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then <b>dial</b> the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> tone, <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then <b>dial</b> 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the gate}} on Earth was found without a DHD, the Stargate team on Earth {{developed}} {{the technology to}} interface with the gate in order to power it and dial it {{by the use of}} computers. Unlike a DHD, their version is essentially manual <b>dialing,</b> as the system physically moves the inner ring to lock in the address. <b>Dialing</b> on a DHD automatically locks in the symbols, making the DHD much faster at <b>dialing.</b> However, the SGC's <b>dialing</b> computer has the advantage of controlling access to the Stargate and storing working addresses, whereas a DHD can be used by anyone and has no easy to access list (a limited number of previously accessed gate addresses are stored in the DHD crystals, but the technology and knowledge to access them is not widespread).|$|E
25|$|With 38 symbols, the Stargate Network in the Milky Way has (theoretically) 1,987,690,320 (38×37×36×35×34×33) {{possible}} 7-symbol addresses. However, {{since only}} a small fraction of these make up valid destinations, randomly <b>dialing</b> the Stargate is largely futile.

50|$|Sundials are {{sometimes}} combined into multiple <b>dials.</b> If {{two or more}} <b>dials</b> that operate on different principles — say, such as an analemmatic <b>dial</b> and a horizontal or vertical <b>dial</b> — are combined, the resulting multiple <b>dial</b> becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both <b>dials</b> need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true North need not be determined; the <b>dials</b> are oriented correctly when they read {{the same time and}} declination. However, the most common forms combine <b>dials</b> are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.|$|R
50|$|Land line {{phone numbers}} in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.To <b>dial</b> a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number {{needs to be}} <b>dialled.</b> When <b>dialling</b> from a {{different}} Area/City, the telephone number is <b>dialled</b> in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number.

50|$|Vertical declining <b>dials</b> are sundials that {{indicate}} local apparent time. Vertical south <b>dials</b> are a special case: as are vertical north, vertical east and vertical west <b>dials.</b> The word declining {{means that the}} wall is offset from one of these 4 cardinal points.

25|$|Using an {{emergency}} number recognized by a GSM phone like 112 instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone <b>dialing</b> {{an emergency}} service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam onto another network, leading to trouble {{if there is}} no access to the home network. <b>Dialing</b> a known emergency number like 112 forces the phone to try the call with any available network.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> tone is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> tones are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dial</b> {{is said to}} be {{equiangular}} if its hour-lines {{are straight}} and spaced equally.
