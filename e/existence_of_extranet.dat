40|$|In recent times, {{extranet}} {{has been}} used extensively in SCM by business firms with exchange partners to achieve operating efficiency. And organizational factors play a pivotal role to fully acknowledge the benefits <b>of</b> <b>extranet</b> in SCM to achieve this efficiency. The purpose of our study is {{to gain a better}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>extranet</b> adoption in SCM and to find out the benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> adoption. Our study showed with empirical data of two company’s (LKAB, Sweden and DHL, Bangladesh unit) that there is a direct relationship between organizational factors and extranet adoption. Organizational factors should be taken into consideration actively to see and measure how these factors are affecting the adoption processes to calibrate organizational practices to gain utmost benefits. The extranet investigated differed from what the literature suggested on many points. One of the features that has been revealed from the study that LKAB did not perceive most <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> benefits, and the reason is that LKAB has only few fixed customers and they used their extranet system as a supplementary services to their core businesses. On the other hand, DHL made the extranet system as their core business process: thus acknowledging most of the benefits in a positive way. Extranet has the potential to provide far more benefits to companies than they perceive and it is changing faster than the literature emerges. Technological improvements offset major disadvantages that once researchers considered obstacle to extranet implementation. Our research indicated that all members of the company, from top management personnel to first level employees should have the positive mindsets to adapt to contemporary developments in technology to reap the maximum benefits <b>of</b> <b>extranet.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel, {{agent-based}} middleware for efficient management <b>of</b> an <b>extranet.</b> To keep an extranet in full working order, its network connections (e. g., routing, bandwidth assigning, etc.) {{have to be}} customized for the specific network services in a particular group. However, such customization work imposes a heavy workload on the extranet administrator, and this makes {{it very difficult to}} achieve efficient management <b>of</b> the <b>extranet.</b> To overcome this difficulty, we propose an agent-based middleware between the application layer and the transport layer <b>of</b> the <b>extranet.</b> This middleware controls network connections based on known specifications <b>of</b> the <b>extranet,</b> and thus it provides well-customized network connections for users and extranet applications.

At the same time, {{the capabilities of}} such systems are continually evolving. Extranets for B 2 B information sharing and transaction handling are becoming increasingly common. The purpose of this thesis {{is to provide a}} better understanding on how extranets add value in B 2 B organizations. To reach this purpose, three research questions are stated, focusing on the types <b>of</b> <b>extranets</b> and their characteristics, the security issues <b>of</b> <b>extranets,</b> as well as the stakeholders served at this level. In order to collect data to be able to answer these research questions, a case study strategy was used, focusing on Ericsson and Volvo in Sweden. Interviews were used as the primary data collection tool. The findings indicate that the type <b>of</b> <b>extranet</b> used depends upon the business model and communication system of the organization. Regarding security issues, organizations are tying to create value by providing a secure environment, where issues like visibility of information are the main concern. In terms of the stakeholders being served at this level, government and community are considered the most important. The results also show that new information technology models like extranets are enabling the development of the advanced commerce capabilities. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reports {{published}} by Sir John Egan and Sir Michael Latham {{indicate that the}} construction industry must adopt new technologies to improve areas of construction management. The use <b>of</b> construction project <b>extranets</b> is one <b>of</b> these new technologies. This paper sets to identify the barriers that influence the imple-mentation <b>of</b> construction project <b>extranets</b> in the UK construction industry. A critical review of current litera-ture was conducted, and an in-depth questionnaire and supportive interview were then used to explore the implementation <b>of</b> <b>extranets,</b> identifying their main benefits and barriers. The main benefits identified are im-proved communication, document storage, and drawing management process. The main barriers identified are; Technical; insufficient technology infrastructure {{and low levels of}} usability. People; resistance to change, insufficient training, low utilisation of functions and a lack of understanding of the benefits. Managerial; low levels of management commitment, lack of client support, lack of a sufficient protocol document, lack of inte-gration meetings, and low usage levels.

40|$|Project extranets {{are adopted}} to improve {{information}} management, communication and collaborative working in construction industry. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} their development, evolution and implementation. The benefits, barriers and success factors surrounding the use <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> are also documented. However, although the general functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> have been identified and described, {{there is still a}} lack of systematic way to analyze the functionalities provided by different systems and required by various users. To bridge this gap, this research develops a novel approach aiming to find the differences, major components and potential improvements from the integrated analysis to systems' provisions and user requirements. This approach, named, Provision & Requirement (P&R) approach starts with the reviews to the development and use <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> and outlines the characteristics of such systems. It has then listed and grouped the function and associated features into some categories, in order to set the criteria for the analysis from system provisions and user requirements. Afterwards, it conducts investigations by case study and questionnaire survey, aiming to gather functionalities provided by selected sample systems and to elicit user requirements to the listed functionalities. The results help the author to classify the functionalities hierarchically based on their availability in the products and users' preferences. The investigations have therefore established the fundament for proposing the P&R approach and conduct further analysis by comparing the provisions and requirements. Through the analysis, the author reaches research findings, by presenting the differences, major components and possible improvements of functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets.</b> Later, the research findings are validated and proposed approach is consolidated by interviews, leading to the answers to the research questions and concluding research outcomes. The main contribution of this research is that it develops a novel approach to analyze functionalities in project extranets. This approach aims to integrate both systems provisions and user requirements into consideration. By doing so, this approach studies system vendors and users' perspectives to functionality issues, to reflect their respective attitude and make the comparison, in order that researchers can have wider knowledge from different research angles and achieve the balance on the issues of systems' provisions and user requirements. So, this research has established a holistic approach of analysing functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets,</b> rather than focusing only on one part from either vendors or users, which in return has contributed to its uniqueness and distinctiveness. The result may be useful to system vendors, customers and researchers involved in the development and implementation <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> or other web-based information systems. The research has put forward to the ideas for other similar research, with more holistic consideration to all stakeholders involved in the studied topics. It {{can also be used to}} develop other methodologies that consider the adaptation of elements of one industry's practice to another, thus satisfying other research gaps...|$|R

40|$|Introduction There {{have been}} many recent {{articles}} on the application and usefulness <b>of</b> an <b>extranet</b> as {{a new form of}} technology (Dalton, 1997; Flanagan, 1997; Frost, 1998; McCarthy, 1997; Schnaidt, 1997; Strom, 1997; Tweney, 1997 among others). In general, these articles have commented on how an extranet {{can be used as a}} tool to reduce costs and gain competitive advantage. All these articles, without exception, provide theoretical frameworks to explain how an extranet will generate benefits. This article uses a case study approach to demonstrate how the concept <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> can be used to reduce significant costs that companies incur in their respective "value chains" and enhance competitive advantage for firms.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis is {{to gain a}} better {{understanding}} <b>of</b> how <b>Extranets</b> are used in supply chain management. This thesis study an Extranet’s use in the supply chain, its advantages and its disadvantages. Three different companies are investigated: Tetra Pak Norway, Tine Mejerier and Nen-Produkter: all related to the same Extranet. Since Extranet is a rather new phenomenon, especially in Europe, this thesis is based on both traditional supply chain management and more recent literature. It seems as if this Extranet differs to some extent from what the literature suggest, probably partly because of the already established relationship between the trading partners. Tetra Pak, that is the supplier <b>of</b> this <b>Extranet,</b> seem to some degree see different things in the system than their clients. The Extranet discussed seems, however, to be successful since many positive views were brought to surface, but relatively few negative aspects.
