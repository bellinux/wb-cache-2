40|$|Classical Karst {{is a broad}} area {{located between}} the {{north-eastern}} Italian sector and the south-western Slovenian side. The area is about 40 km long and 15 wide (SE-NW direction) bounded by the Isonzo/Soča and Vipacco/Vipava rivers, by the Pivka River basin, Cicarija structure and the Gulf of Trieste. The plateau, slightly inclined towards NW, consists of limestone lithotypes deeply karstified. Rainfall and surface waters are immediately swallowed by the karst bedrock, where a network of caves is developed, transferring vertically the waters through the epikarst and vadose zone and collecting them in the aquifer characterized by large horizontal or sub-horizontal conduits quickly transporting the waters to the spring’s area. Data analysis obtained from Classical Karst groundwater monitoring networks highlights {{the complexity of the}} hydrostructure. In this framework, the Hydrokarst Project (<b>Italy-Slovenia’s</b> transboundary cooperation program 2007 - 2013), is focused on the joint protection and management of the transboundary aquifer through quantitative and qualitative monitoring. One of Hydrokarst’s outputs is the shared GeoDatabase collecting all the available and newly obtained geological, hydrological, hydrodynamic, geochemical and biological data. Unified maps as the Integrated Vulnerability Map obtained from the collected, validated and analyzed data are the common base to prepare cooperation agreements able to promote and implement action focused on the protection areas identification and realization. This common vision implements strategies able to prevent and/or reduce risks in emergencies. In this framework, also the support to the water consumption’s reduction as the efficiency of the water network management and the improvement of drinking water quality, guarantee, to the future generations, an abundance of good quality waters...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is a recently-introduced {{remote sensing}} technology that shows high potentiality {{in the context}} of the forestry resources management. The research group of the University of Udine, within an INTERREG IIIA Phare/CBC <b>Italy-Slovenia</b> project, developed specific methods regarding the use of LiDAR data for forestry applications. A specific methodology which makes possible to obtain the position of the single trees and their relative heights has been implemented. On the basis of the height distributions, using stand height curves relation already available in the stand volume tables, a method to derive the volume values of each tree is proposed. The paper shows the first results obtained with the above method in terms of diameter and volume estimation on the basis of laser scanning data surveyed in different composed forestry plots. A comparison between laser-based and traditional methods-based data is also presented. Some of the consequences of this different way to use the stand volume tables were analyzed, and an experimental procedure is proposed that seems to guarantee a sufficient reliability of the results, and their historical continuity. Furthermore, the approach described may reduce the costs of the traditional dendrometric assessment, nowadays not sustainable in forest management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calibration}} of terrestrial laser intensity measures. As known, 3 D terrestrial laser scanner provide with {{a great amount of}} geometric data. An important and still seldom used information is the one given by laser backscattering. In this paper we propose a geometric algorithm for terrestrial laser intensity calibration, based onto two different steps. Firstly a distancebased calibration is computed, taking into account the fact that a laser beam varies its intensity when passing through a given medium. In this phase an global air absorbtion coefficient is estimated. Secondly, two separate geometric reflectance models are implemented, depending on the acquired features whose intensity measures need to be calibrated. Lambertian and Lommel-Seeliger reflectance models were implemented initially in MatLab® environment and secondly ported in IDL® language, both leading to a new DN (Digital Number), defined as pseudo-reflectance. Differently from a common data stretching procedure, results so far obtained with this method, show the possibility to appreciate micro-discontinuities in pseudo-reflectance data, usually corresponding to non homogeneous areas in the object acquired. This work has been developed in the frame of the research project INTERREG IIIA <b>Italy-Slovenia,</b> while the data acquisition campaign has been entirely carried on by the D. I. A. Pr. E.

40|$|The {{development}} of plans and projects for cross-border territories {{has become a}} crucial theme for the redrawing of european geographies. UE programmes, such as Interreg, have been specifically created for the cooperation between countries and public/private actors, {{in order to build}} intermediate common levels of governance and to awaken the interest of local communities in european unification process. Since on May 1 st 2004 Slovenia entered European Union, the drawing of planning tools to apply both to Italian and Slovenian countries has become more and more important, as well as the rethinking of the role and spatial organization of cross-border areas. In the sphere of the most recent actions envisaged within the programme Interreg IIIA <b>Italy-Slovenia</b> (2000 - 2006), the Department of Architectural and Urban Planning of the University of Trieste has been involved by the Directorate of Building and Technical Services of the italian Region Friuli Venezia Giulia to perform the research project “Sustainable models and typologies in the view of environmental sustainability in Italy/Slovenia cross-border territories”.

40|$|With the {{extension}} to Slovenia of the Schengen procedures (2008) the foundations {{have been laid}} for a process of gradual reconstruction of the territorial structure at Italy’s eastern border. In the particular case of Gorizia, chief town {{of one of the}} smallest Italian provinces, the preconditions are ripening for the town urban area to rejoin the new city which has developed {{on the other side of}} the 1947 border under the name of Nova Gorica. Urban duplication is one of the most impressive consequences of the Cold War. In this case it has been the ultimate stage of the dissolution of an ancient historical and geographical unit, the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, beginning in the immediate aftermath of the First World War. The fall of the border has now led to the restoration of a territorial continuity which had been interrupted as a consequence of the Second World War. The rise of a single urban area which, though politically belonging to two different countries, is bound to share a common future implies that in the long run it will resume the role of territorial coordination formerly held by the chief town of the County of Gorizia. As far as the urban system of the region Friuli Venezia Giulia is concerned, the new urban unit would rank third both in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia (immediately after Udine) and in Slovenia, close behind Maribor. The effect of the overlaying of the two town units following the abolition of borders in the redesigning of the whole urban network cound not find a more striking example. For this “new” town which in fact already exists although geography has not yet taken it into proper consideration, a new name has been proposed. Gorizia Nova would give equal dignity to both national components, blending the Slav and Latin language together so as to highlight its roots deep into the history of Europe. This paper, taken from a research carried out within the community programme Interreg IIIA <b>Italy-Slovenia,</b> tackles the issue of the territorial articulation of the new town, focussing in particular on the identification of the urban core and the perimeter of the agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|The {{preferential}} {{flow path}} of groundwaters through limestone aquifers by matrix flow within rock pores or networks of micro fractures and by fast conduit flows in large fissures and openings has important consequences on solute concentration, and poses critical problems {{in terms of}} contaminant transport. In particular, fast conduit flows can transmit contaminants rapidly, and pollutants may arrive earlier to pumping stations for drinkable water supply yielding peaks in concentrations. The slow draining of the resident mass water and diffusion into rock pores produce a continuous source of contamination, even if generally at lower concentration. The detection of the preferential flow paths, residence times and flow dynamics is hence of the uppermost importance in carbonate karst aquifers, with implications on the possible seasonal variations in water quality. Conduit flow and diffuse flow often result in springs with different chemical patterns, temperature and discharge rates, and anthropogenic tracers such as chlorofluorocarbons are effective for tracing groundwater flow. However, {{the usefulness of the}} Sr-isotope systematics has been in many cases demonstrated in the reconstruction of the water-carbonate rock interaction, becoming an important tracer of groundwater movement. In fact, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in groundwaters reflect the water-rock interaction. In this study, surface, cave and spring waters have been collected during high and low-flow conditions in the Classical Karst area (northern Italy and Slovenia), a carbonate plateau that rises above the northern Adriatic Sea and consisting in a thick sequence of limestones and dolostones dated Cretaceous and Tertiary. Waters belong to the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-Mg-HCO 3 hydrofacies. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in surface, cave waters and springs ranges between 0. 70781 ÷ 0. 70838, 0. 70787 ÷ 0. 70824 and 0. 70757 ÷ 0. 70786, respectively, during low flow, and between 0. 70760 ÷ 0. 70843, 0. 70749 ÷ 0. 70810 and 0. 70759 ÷ 0. 70800 during high flow. The data indicate the relative contribution of the Isonzo and Reka rivers, with relatively high Sr isotopic composition, as inputs to the Classical Karst aquifer. Furthermore, cave waters have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio higher with respect to the Sr isotopic composition measured in limestone rock samples (87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 70743 ÷ 0. 70752), while springs range from near-isotopic equilibrium with limestones towards a more radiogenic character, suggesting different water-rock contact times. These data are interpreted in terms {{of the role of the}} processes in the upper, phreatic zone and on the different flow dynamics in the area, which have a different vulnerability towards pollution.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of the seismogenic sources of NE Italy and W Slovenia, included in the updated version of the Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources (DISS 3. 0. 2). We will discuss their location, geometry and kinematics, and give some examples of their morphotectonic signature. In the Veneto-Friuli area (NE Italy), destructive earthquakes up to M 6. 7 are generated by thrust faulting along S-verging structures of the Eastern Southalpine chain, that from W to E follow a NE-SW to E-W trend, and mark the mountain front. Blind thrusting accommodates about 2. 0 mm/yr of plate convergence, and is associated to growing anticlines, tilted and uplifted Quaternary paleolandscapes and forced drainage. To the east, beyond the <b>Italy-Slovenia</b> boundary, dextral strike-slip faulting along the NW-SE trending structures of the Idrija system dominates the seismic release. Activity and faulting mechanism are shown by recent earthquakes (e. g. : the Ms 5. 7, 1998 Bovec and the Mw 5. 2, 2004 Kobarid earthquakes), while the related morphotectonic imprint is still a debated matter. DISS (the 3. 0. 2 version of which is presented in this same meeting session) is a georeferenced repository of tectonic, fault and paleoseismological information for the Italian territory and surrounding regions. The main object of the database is the seismogenic source, a simplified and georeferenced three-dimensional representation of a fault plane. The seismogenic sources, identified through integrated geological and geophysical investigations, are capable of primary slip during a large earthquake, and are assumed to exhibit “characteristic” behaviour with respect to rupture length/width and expected magnitude. The content of DISS 3. 0. 2 puts significant emphasis on potential applications in the assessment of seismic hazard, through the synoptic view of different layer of information, and the use of specifically developed GIS tools. The identification of the seismogenic sources responsible for earthquakes of Mw≥ 5. 5, and the characterization of their geometry in the study area follow the work by several authors which investigated the area between the Lessini Mountains and the Italian-Slovenian border. Seismogenic sources result from a 3 -step procedure routinely applied each time their parameters have to be derived from published works. In the first step, we verify the consistency of geometry and size of faults, as results from geological field studies, with respect to the seismological parameters of the known major earthquakes that can be associated to them. This phase of the procedure includes the usage of empirical and analytical relationships between length, width and slip of faults and magnitude, seismic moment and stress drop of earthquakes. In the second step, we scrutinize the minor or less known earthquakes (down to M 5 +) as a double check for hints of fault activity. In the third step, we analyze all faults that were not associated to any known earthquake in search for possible seismic gaps. In this phase, we usually rely on the best known sources as model faults for segmentation. The release of DISS 3. 0. 2 shows that in Veneto and western Friuli, coseismic deformation seems to be adsorbed almost entirely along a single alignment of thrust faults, while in the epicentral area of the Friuli 1976 earthquake sequence deformation is distributed on more thrust fronts. Western Slovenia, instead, is characterized by several subparallel active strike-slip strands...|$|E
