25|$|Water extraction: Coffee {{beans are}} soaked in water.

25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coffee husk {{and coffee}} pulp are coffee {{processing}} by-products. Coffee husk is obtained when harvested coffee is processed by the dry method, and coffee pulp {{is produced by}} the wet method. In Brazil, coffee is usually processed by the dry method, therefore an expressive amount of husk is obtained every year. Some of the husk is used as organic fertilizer but, other applications are very limited, mainly {{because it is a}} bulky product. The presence of tannins and caffeine diminish acceptability and palatability of husk by animals. This review discuss degradation of caffeine by microorganisms, with special attention to bacterial, biological decaffeination of coffee husk and pulp and its subsequent use on animal feeding. The known biochemical routes of caffeine degradation by microorganisms are initially discussed; problems concerning physiological effects in animals, focusing on the limitations imposed by caffeine as an antiphysiological component are raised; the use of microorganisms to <b>decaffeinate</b> <b>coffee</b> husk and pulp is discussed. The discussions offer a view on decreasing caffeine content of coffee husk and pulp, which would allow the use of larger amounts of these products in animal feeding, partially replacing traditional components such as cereal grains...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} approaches for the profiling of coffee using two multidimensional approaches: (1) a multi-detection process and (2) a multi-separation process employing HPLC. The first approach compared multidetection techniques of conventional High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated with a detector (DPPH•, UV-Vis and MS), and multiplexed mode via HPLC with an Active Flow Technology (AFT) column in Parallel Segmented Flow (PSF) format with DPPH• detection, UV-Vis and MS running simultaneously. Multiplexed HPLCPSF enabled {{the determination of}} key chemical entities by reducing the data complexity of the sample whilst obtaining {{a greater degree of}} molecule-specific information within a fraction of the time it takes using conventional multi-detection processes. DPPH•, UV-Vis and MS (TIC) were multiplexed for the analysis of espresso <b>coffee</b> and <b>decaffeinated</b> espresso <b>coffee.</b> Up to 20 DPPH• peaks were detected for each sample, and with direct retention time peak matching, 70 % of DPPH• peaks gave a UV-Vis response for the espresso coffee and 95 % for the <b>decaffeinated</b> espresso <b>coffee.</b> The second approach involved the use of a two-dimensional (2 D) HPLC system to expand the separation space and separation power for the analysis of coffee, focusing on the resolution and detection of coeluting and overlapping peaks, which was beyond the limits of conventional HPLC in resolving complex samples.
