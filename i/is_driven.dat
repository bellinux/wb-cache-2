5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by the tool holder.|$|E

Consequently, the Sounders were also ranked as the most valuable franchise ($245million) in MLS– a 717% increase over the expansion fee it paid to join the league. The Sounders financial success <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in large part by their high attendance figures.|$|E

Despite their enmity toward him, Odysseus persuades the kings Menelaus and Agamemnon to grant Ajax a proper burial.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{market and}} brand focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand {{as the core}} for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The design <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by the brand vision and strategy.|$|E
5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by {{the movement of}} sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but {{this might not be}} true in all cases.|$|E

Fasteners with tapered shanks {{are designed to}} either <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate.

Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> into a tapped hole.|$|R

5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to this dialogue, love <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E
5|$|September 3–8, 1915 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} meanders {{around the}} islands for several days, {{during which time}} gale-force winds blow from nearly all directions. Heavy rains cause many roofs to leak, and overall damage is extensive. Enormous waves from the hurricane wreck many boats; one cargo ship in particular, the SS Pollockshields, <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> aground on a reef off Elbow Beach. The captain drowns while attempting to procure a life jacket for a crew member, but all other men are eventually rescued.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> {{by various}} processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are {{built by the}} decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla {{can be considered as}} a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E

5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine.
