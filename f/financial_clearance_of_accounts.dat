40|$|Eptifibatide is a {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIainhibitor used {{to inhibit}} platelet ag-gregation and prevent thromboses in pa-tients with acute coronary syndrome. Re-nal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> eptifibatide <b>accounts</b> for approximately 50 % of total body clear-ance, {{with the majority}} of the drug excret-ed in the urine unchanged or as metabo-lites. 1 In patients with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency, the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> the drug is decreased by approximately half. To prevent dangerous drug accumulation, the manufacturer of eptifibatide recom-mends that after the initial bolus, the con-tinuous infusion dose should be adjusted from 2 µg/kg/min to 1 µg/kg/min for all patients with moderate-to-severe renal in-sufficiency. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, this is further defined as a creati-nine clearance (CrCl) less than 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) formula using actual body weight (ABW). 1, 2 Medications that are renally eliminat-ed often require dosing adjustments to protect patients from harmful drug accu-mulation. While the most precise mecha-nism in determining renal function is di-rect measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using an exogenous marker, this is costly and unfeasible in clinical practice. A common alternative is to use the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> an endogenous marker, creatinine, as an es-timate of renal function. CrCl can be determined using 24 -hour urine creatinine measurements but is more commonly estimated from serum creatinine (SCr) levels manipulated with an equation that takes several relevant patient parame-ters into consideration. The most prominent example is the CG equation, which was developed in 1973 to mathemati...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tolerance}} of acyclovir administered intravenously in single doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0, and 15. 0 mg/kg were studied in 13 volunteers. The mean concentrations (+/- standard deviations) {{at the end}} of infusion as measured by radioimmunoassay were 4. 52 +/ 0 0. 31, 8. 28 +/- 2. 61, 14. 6 +/- 2. 30, and 22. 7 +/- 10. 4 microgram/ml, respectively. Drug elimination during and after the infusion of acyclovir was well described by a two-compartment open model. The mean terminal plasma half-life for each of the groups was 2. 85, 2. 80, 3. 30, and 2. 38 h, respectively. Within 72 h after the start of the infusion, 70 % of the administered drug was recovered in the urine as unchanged acyclovir. The renal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> acyclovir <b>accounted</b> for about 77 % <b>of</b> the total <b>clearance</b> and was about threefold greater than the creatinine clearance. This confirms that acyclovir is eliminated predominantly by the kidneys in patients with normal renal function and suggests that renal secretion and glomerular filtration may both be involved.

40|$|The plasma {{disappearance}} rate (metabolic <b>clearance</b> rate) <b>of</b> administered intact {{parathyroid hormone}} (intact PTH) was analyzed in awake dogs with indwelling hepatic and renal vein catheters. The metabolic <b>clearance</b> rate (MCR) <b>of</b> intact PTH {{was found to}} be very rapid, 21. 6 ± 3. 1 ml/min per kg in 11 normal dogs. The liver accounted for the greatest fraction of the MCR of intact PTH (61 ± 4 %) by virtue of an arterial minus venous (a - v) difference across the liver of 45 ± 3 %. The renal uptake <b>of</b> intact PTH <b>accounted</b> for 31 ± 3 % of the MCR of intact PTH. The renal a - v difference for intact PTH of 29 ± 2 % was significantly greater than the filtration fraction indicating renal uptake of intact PTH at sites independent of glomerular filtration. Together, the hepatic and renal <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> intact PTH <b>accounted</b> for all but {{a small fraction of the}} MCR of intact PTH. The MCR of intact PTH, rendered biologically inactive by oxidation, was markedly decreased to 8. 8 ± 1 ml/min per kg.

40|$|Hyponatremia {{secondary}} to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters {{can be helpful in}} the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> urea <b>accounts</b> for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70 %) compared with salt-depleted patients (40 %). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO 2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia {{secondary to}} hypocorticism, total CO 2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na;> 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0. 5 % in 70 % of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V 2 antagonist.

Ten patients received 3 mg/kg and six patients received 4 mg/kg of bepridil infused {{over a period of}} 30 min. Plasma bepridil concentrations were measured by HPLC and analyzed by model-dependent and model-independent methods. The mean (+/- SD) maximum plasma bepridil concentrations {{at the end of the}} infusion were 2047 +/- 820 ng/mL (3 mg/kg) and 2478 +/- 1426 ng/mL (4 mg/kg). Postinfusion bepridil concentrations were best described by a two-compartment open model. The model-dependent harmonic mean distribution and elimination half-lives were 1. 7 h (range: 1. 1 - 2. 2 h) and 19. 7 h (range: 8. 0 - 61. 9 h), respectively. The harmonic mean elimination half-life from model-independent analysis was 14. 9 h (range: 7. 4 - 64. 0 h). The arithmetic means of other model-independent kinetic parameters were systemic clearance, 0. 524 +/- 0. 215 L X kg- 1 X h- 1; Vd, 15. 3 +/- 10. 9 L/kg; and Vdss, 10. 1 +/- 6. 0 L/kg.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of age and}} gender on the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in healthy subjects receiving a single oral 500 -mg dose of levofloxacin was investigated in this parallel design study. Six young males (aged 18 to 40 years), six elderly males (aged > or = 65 years), six young females (aged 18 to 40 years), and six elderly females (aged > or = 65 years) were enrolled and completed the study. The study reveals that the bioavailability (rate and extent) of levofloxacin was not affected by either age or gender. In both age (young and elderly) and gender (male and female) groups of subjects, peak concentrations in plasma were reached at approximately 1. 5 h after dosing; renal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> levofloxacin <b>accounted</b> for approximately 77 % <b>of</b> total body <b>clearance,</b> and approximately 76 % of the administered dose was recovered unchanged in urine over the 36 h of collection. The apparent differences in the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters for levofloxacin between the age groups (young versus elderly) and between the gender groups (males versus females) {{could be explained by}} differences in renal function among the subjects. A single dose of 500 mg of levofloxacin administered orally to both young and old, male and female healthy subjects was found to be safe and well tolerated. As the differences in levofloxacin kinetics between the young and the elderly or the males and the females are limited and are mainly related to the renal function of the subjects, dose adjustment based on age or gender alone is not necessary...|$|R

Concentrations of drug in all samples were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The elimination of the drug from the blood followed a biexponential (i. v. administration) or a monoexponential (endotracheal and aerosol administrations) decay, with an elimination half-life of 6 h and a total body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> 4. 2 liters/h.

40|$|International audienceAIMS:Serotonin (5 -HT) neurons {{mediate the}} ectopic release of {{dopamine}} (DA) induced by L-DOPA in the Parkinsonian brain. We {{hypothesized that the}} participation of noradrenalin transporters (NET) in the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> DA may <b>account</b> for the lower effect of L-DOPA in extrastriatal regions compared with the striatum. METHODS:Using a multisite intracerebral microdialysis approach, we tested {{the influence of the}} pharmacological blockade of NET and/or the destruction of noradrenalin (NE) fibers on DA and 5 -HT release in the striatum, hippocampus (HIPP), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. RESULTS:L-DOPA (12 mg/kg, i. p.) increased DA extracellular levels to a lesser extent in the SNr, PFC and HIPP compared with the striatum. The NET blockers desipramine (10 mg/kg, i. p.) and reboxetine (3 mg/kg, i. p.) potentiated L-DOPA effect in the PFC, SNr and HIPP but not in the striatum. The NE neurotoxin N-(2 -chloroethyl) -N-ethyl- 2 -bromobenzylamine (50 mg/kg, i. p. 1 week before dialysis experiment) potentiated L-DOPA effect in the SNr and HIPP. 5 -HT extracellular levels were enhanced only when L-DOPA was combined to NET blockers. CONCLUSION:Noradrenalin neurons are indirectly involved in the mechanism of action of L-DOPA in part through the heterologous reuptake of DA in extrastriatal regions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Controversy {{exists as}} to whether {{electric}} charges of plasma proteins influence their transport across the peritoneal membrane during CAPD. Fixed negative charges in the peritoneal membrane are diminished during peritonitis in rats. METHODS: Peritoneal <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> 10 proteins and their isoforms were used to establish the relationship between peritoneal clearance and molecular weight. The observed protein clearances were compared with the predicted clearances based on molecular weight. <b>Clearances</b> <b>of</b> proteins with different charge but identical size were compared. Stable patients and peritonitis patients were compared. Results. Only the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase, LDH 4 / 5 and IgG 3 were {{significantly different from the}} predicted values (P <= 0. 05). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic beta 2 microglobulin (1072 microl/min) and cationic lysozyme (572 microl/min) showed no evidence for charge selectivity; neither did the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic transferrin (86 microl/min) and highly anionic albumin (99 microl/min). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgG 4 were identical (32, 31 and 31 microl/min), despite their different charge. The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> cationic LDH 4 / 5 was 137 microl/min and higher than the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral LDH 3 (97 microl/min, P= 0. 01) and LDH 1 (59 microl/min, P= 0. 02). These results suggested charge selectivity; however in five additional patients during peritonitis the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 4 / 5 increased to 10 times the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 1. Local LDH isoenzyme release from the cells present in the dialysate was shown to be responsible in stable and peritonitis patients. Likewise, the higher peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral pancreatic amylase (234 microl/min) compared to anionic salivary amylase (142 microl/min, P= 0. 03) could probably be attributed to local release of the former from the pancreas, as the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase (highly anionic) was higher than predicted and the difference remained during peritonitis.

40|$|Imipenem is {{the first}} {{clinically}} available carbapenem antibiotic. Since it is hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase-I, a zinc metallo-enzyme resident in the brush border of the renal tubule, it is co-administered with cilastatin, a reversible inhibitor of this enzyme. This provides clinically relevant concentrations of imipenem in the urine for 8 - 10 h after a 500 mg dose. The half-life of both drugs is I h in normal volunteers. Plasma clearances are reproducible between volunteers and studies and average 220 ml/min for imipenem. Renal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> unchanged imipenem <b>accounts</b> for 60 - 70 % <b>of</b> plasma <b>clearance</b> when the imipenem is given with cilastatin. Administration of radio labelled drugs results in recovery of over 99 % of the radiolabel in the urine for both imipenem and cilastatin. With increasing renal dysfunction, the half-life of imipenem is controlled by a metabolic clearance pathway which is unaffected by cilastatin. Renal clearance is by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion for both imipenem and cilastatin. Renal dysfunction results in terminal half-lives of slightly greater than 4 h for imipenem and 16 h for cilastatin in the functionally anephric. Both drugs are well cleared by haemodialysis and supplemental 500 mg doses are recommended after a dialysis.

However, fasting may also affect hepatic blood flow, thereby contributing to reduced <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> these compounds. In order to test this hypothesis, plasma <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> antipyrine, acetaminophen and lidocaine, drugs known to be cleared by the liver yet not suspected of undergoing carrier-mediated hepatic uptake, were investigated in nine healthy adult mares (three horses/drug group) before and following a 3 -day fast.

The <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) was studied in eleven patients on hemodialysis (HD) treatment and nine patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment and {{compared with the}} <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDL in nine control subjects. The clearance rates for LDL (fractional catabolic rate, FCR) in all the uremic patients (FCR for LDL 0. 305 ± 0. 075 pools/day, mean ± SD) were {{significantly lower than the}} <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDL in the control subjects (FCR for LDL 0. 376 ± 0. 045 pools/day; P = 0. 01). The <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDL in the HD patients (FCR for LDL 0. 334 ± 0. 066 pools/day) was only mildly decreased in comparison to the control subjects (P = 0. 122), but the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDL in the CAPD patients was markedly decreased (FCR for LDL 0. 268 ± 0. 072 pools/day) in comparison to the control subjects (P = 0. 001). The FCR for LDL among all the patients was negatively related to the plasma total cholesterol (r = - 0. 56, P = 0. 01) and LDL cholesterol concentration (r = - 0. 76, P = 0. 0002) and LDL apolipoprotein B concentration (r = - 0. 48, P = 0. 03). In conclusion, the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDL is decreased in uremic patients on dialysis treatment. This alteration in the LDL metabolism of the uremic patients may contribute to their accelerated atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Relationship between {{proximal}} sodium reabsorption and excretion of calcium, magnesium and phosphate. The {{relationship between}} sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule, measured by micropuncture techniques, and the urinary excretion of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate was determined following {{a number of}} experimental maneuvers known to increase sodium excretion. Following intravenous infusion of saline or Ringer's solution and the renal arterial infusions of acetylcholine and prostaglandin E 1, proximal sodium reabsorption was significantly decreased while the fractional <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> Na, Ca, Mg and PO 4 were significantly increased. Following the intravenous infusion of hyperoncotic albumin and the renal arterial infusion of parathyroid hormone, proximal sodium reabsorption was significantly decreased and the fractional <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> Na and PO 4 were significantly increased. The fractional <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> Ca and Mg were not increased following these infusions. Following the renal arterial infusion of bradykinin and prostaglandin E 2, {{there was no significant}} change in proximal sodium reabsorption or in the fractional <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> PO 4 while the fractional <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> Na, Ca and Mg were significantly increased. It was concluded that changes in the fractional <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> PO 4 are related to decreases in sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule. Changes in the fractional <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> Ca and Mg were not consistently associated with changes in proximal sodium reabsorption, suggesting that the excretion of these ions is primarily controlled by nephron segments distal to the proximal tubule...|$|R

It is designed to find out whether skill, effort, working condition, readiness of the tool, sophistication of the tool and sufficiency of the tool significantly influence time inefficiency in customs <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> handled container process or not. Observation was conducted within 20 days. After the data was evaluated using Multiple Regression, it is found that the effort, sophistication of the tool and sufficiency of the tool are significant factors that affect time inefftciency in customs <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> handled container process. Besides, it is proven that effort is the most significant factor that influences time inefftciency in customs <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> handled container process...|$|R
40|$|Mice of the C 5 -deficient DBA/ 2 J and B 10. D 2 /oSnJ inbred strains were aerosolized with Staphylococcus aureus, and the {{pulmonary}} <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> bacteria {{was determined}} 4 h later. Both C 5 -deficient strains {{had a significantly}} decreased lung <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus compared with their genetically closest C 5 -sufficient relatives, DBA/ 1 J and B 10. D 2 /nSnJ strains, respectively. Serum hemolytic activity and pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus were also investigated in F 1 and F 2 progenies (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J and DBA/ 2 J X B 10.

Serum hemolytic activity was present in all F 1 (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J) mice, and their pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus was no {{different from that of}} the C 5 -sufficient parents (DBA/ 1 J). The absence of serum hemolytic activity (absence of C 5) in all mice from F 1 and F 2 (DBA/ 2 J X B 10. D 2 /oSnJ) and 20 % of the F 2 (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J) was related to a decreased lung <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus. These results are consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern of heredity for the murine abnormality in pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|Kupffer cells (KCs) rapidly remove {{intravenously}} injected adenovirus (Ad) vectors {{from the}} circulation. A {{better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved could suggest strategies to improve Ad gene delivery by suppressing or evading KC uptake. We recently showed that <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad type 5 vectors by KCs does not involve the interaction of Ad with the well-established Ad receptors, namely, integrins or the coxsackievirus and Ad receptor (J. S. Smith, Z. Xu, J. Tian, S. C. Stevenson, and A. P. Byrnes, Hum. Gene Ther. 19 : 547 - 554, 2008). In the current study, we systematically quantified the contributions of various receptors and plasma proteins to the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad by KCs. We found that scavenger receptors are a predominant mechanism for the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad by KCs. In addition, we found that Ad is opsonized by natural immunoglobulin M antibodies and complement and that these opsonins play a contributory role in the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad by KCs. We also examined additional mechanisms that have been postulated {{to be involved in the}} <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad, including the binding of Ad to platelets and vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, but we found that neither of these were required for the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Ad by KCs...|$|R
