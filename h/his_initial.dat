5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896.

Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in <b>his</b> <b>initial</b> description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
