25|$|On 28 September 1936, Swain {{took off}} from Farnborough in the Type 138A; he climbed to an <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude</b> of 51,000ft (15,440m), during which he engaged the {{auxiliary}} supercharger at 35,000ft (m). Swain ran low on oxygen on the two-hour flight and had to break {{the window of his}} pressure helmet after descending to a safe height. The data from this flight were recognised by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale as a world record of 49,967ft (15,230m).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Bristol's own {{work on the}} Type 138, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and National Physical Laboratory also made valuable contributions to the development effort on designing the type. On 11 May 1936, the Type 138A performed its maiden flight, piloted by Cyril Uwins. On 28 September 1936, Squadron Leader F.R.D. Swain set a new world record altitude record, having climbed to an <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude</b> of 51,000ft (15,440m), which was homologated as 49,967ft (15,230m). After this milestone, research flights continued, along with further attempts to break the altitude record. Further development of the aircraft after the first record-breaking flight led {{to a series of}} small modifications being implemented. The last record-breaking flight was flown on 30 June 1937. A second aircraft, designated as the Type 138B, was ordered in 1935 but work on it was abandoned during 1937 without ever having flown.|$|E

500|$|On 5 February 1952, a Spitfire 19 of 81 Squadron {{based at}} Kai Tak in Hong Kong reached {{probably}} the highest altitude ever achieved by a Spitfire. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Edward Ted Cyril Powles, {{was on a}} routine flight to survey outside-air temperature and report on other meteorological conditions at various altitudes {{in preparation for a}} proposed new air service through the area. He climbed to [...] <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude,</b> with a true altitude of [...] The cabin pressure fell below a safe level and, in trying to reduce altitude, he entered an uncontrollable dive which shook the aircraft violently. He eventually regained control somewhere below [...] and landed safely with no discernible damage to his aircraft. Evaluation of the recorded flight data suggested that, in the dive, he achieved a speed of , (Mach0.96), which would have been the highest speed ever reached by a propeller-driven aircraft, but it has been speculated this figure resulted from inherent instrument errors.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the need}} to {{manufacture}} combat aircraft quickly and the close proximity to the Republic Aviation factory, active duty pilots were used for some of the test flights of the new P-47. [...] On 13 November 1942, Lts. Comstock and Dyar were ordered to test a new type of radio antenna on the P-47C. [...] Lt. Comstock climbed to an <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude</b> of 49,600 feet (15,118 meters) while trying to reach 50,000 feet. Due to poor response from the controls, he decided to let the aircraft fall off rather than risk a spin. He started to dive straight down and after passing below 40,000 feet he found that his controls had frozen. Comstock then felt a bump and was unable to move the controls as the aircraft continued to dive. [...] Even with maximum exertion, he was unable to move the control stick so he started to roll the trim tab back and after passing below 30,000 feet, the aircraft started {{to pull out of the}} dive and he recovered between 20,000 and 25,000 feet. [...] Lt. Dyar started his dive and encountered the same conditions.|$|E

50|$|Altitude can be {{determined}} based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure. The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a barometer is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to <b>indicate</b> <b>altitude,</b> the instrument is called a pressure altimeter or barometric altimeter. A pressure altimeter is the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes.

50|$|After the war the atlas {{maintained}} the same character with {{relief in the}} style of the great classic atlases (hachuring), in contrast to newly published works, that used isohypses (contour lines) to <b>indicate</b> <b>altitudes.</b> This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the Atlante Internazionale, the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the map surface consisted of about 18 square metres!

5000|$|In {{aviation}} terminology, {{the regional}} or local air pressure at {{mean sea level}} (MSL) is called the QNH or [...] "altimeter setting", and the pressure that will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given airfield is called the QFE of the field. An altimeter cannot, however, be adjusted for variations in air temperature. Differences in temperature from the ISA model will accordingly cause errors in <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude.</b>|$|E

50|$|The static {{pressure}} system {{is open to}} the exterior of the aircraft to sense the pressure of the atmosphere at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. This small opening is called the static port. In flight the air pressure is slightly different at different positions around the exterior of the aircraft. The aircraft designer must select the position of the static port carefully. There is no position on the exterior of an aircraft at which the air pressure, for all angles of attack, is identical to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. The difference in pressure causes a small error in the altitude indicated on the altimeter, and the airspeed indicated on the airspeed indicator. This error in <b>indicated</b> <b>altitude</b> and airspeed is called position error.|$|E
