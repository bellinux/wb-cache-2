60|$|As we {{had some}} way, however, to trot along the valley before {{we came to the}} {{ascending}} place, I improved the opportunity to cultivate a little the acquaintance of my guide. He was a tall, spare man, with black eyes, black hair, and features expressive of shrewdness, energy, and determination. Either from paralysis, or some other cause, he was subject to a spasmodic twitching of the features, producing very much the effect that <b>heat</b> <b>lightning</b> does in the summer sky--it seemed to flash over his face and be gone in a wink; at first this looked to me very odd, but so much do our ideas depend on association, that after I had known him for some time, I really thought that I liked him better with, than I should without it. It seemed to give originality to the expression of his face; he was such a good, fatherly man, and took such excellent care of me and the mule, and showed so much intelligence and dignity in his conversation, that I could do no less than like him, <b>heat</b> <b>lightning</b> and all.|$|E

So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. He says: ...|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are designed to}} mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess <b>heat.</b> Since <b>lightning</b> strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and skin effect.|$|R

Surely from time to time, for its vestiges never depart, it floats through our atmosphere. It takes place, like vegetation in so many materials, because there is such a law, but always without permanent form, though ancient and familiar as the sun and moon, and as sure to come again. The heart is forever inexperienced. They silently gather as by magic, these never failing, never quite deceiving visions, like the bright and fleecy clouds in the calmest and clearest days. The Friend is some fair floating isle of palms eluding the mariner in Pacific seas. Many are the dangers to be encountered, equinoctial gales and coral reefs, ere he may sail before the constant trades.

40|$|One {{mechanism}} by which NO(x) is produced in the atmosphere is <b>heating</b> in <b>lightning</b> discharge channels. Since most viable proposed electrification mechanisms involve ice crystals, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that lightning discharge channels frequently pass through fields of ice particles of various kinds. We address the question of whether ice crystals may serve as catalysts for the production of NO(x) by lightning discharges. If so, and if the effect is large, it would need to be taken into account in estimates of global NO(x) production by lightning. In this study, we make a series of plausible assumptions about the temperature and concentration of reactant species in the environment of discharges and we postulate a {{mechanism by}} which ice crystals are able to adsorb nitrogen atoms. We then compare production rates between uncatalyzed and catalytic reactions at 2000 K, 3000 K, and 4000 K. Catalyzed NO production rates are greater at 2000 K, whereas uncatalyzed production occurs most rapidly at 4000 K. 201...|$|R

40|$|In 2016, {{the global}} energy {{consumption}} was represented to 20 % by buildings, where energy use supplied <b>heating,</b> cooling, <b>lightning</b> and water <b>heating.</b> For {{the following years}} until 2040, global energy consumption {{is expected to grow}} 48 %, which in turn make demand for energy efficient measures. For the years of 2030 as well 2050, the EU-commission have set up climate goals to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Along with this were presented strategies for meeting future climate goals, where one strategy is about increasing overall energy efficiency, which includes buildings. One way of increasing building energy efficiency is through implementation of smart heating control, a cost-effective solution which through a retrofitting measure may reduce building energy consumption. For this paper, a smart thermostat named Ngenic Tune was implemented into a selection of single family houses in Borlänge district heating network. The purpose was to study improvements in thermal comfort and reduction of return temperature from domestic substations. Through a combined survey-interview study of Ngenic Tune users, the study revealed promising potentials for large scale implementation of the technology. The smart thermostat also showed tendency of lowering the return temperature...|$|R
