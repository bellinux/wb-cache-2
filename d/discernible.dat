5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} has no <b>discernible</b> odor, and its {{taste is}} unknown. It {{has been described}} as inedible due to its toughness.|$|E
5|$|A typical keep {{would have}} {{between three and}} seven stories <b>discernible</b> from the outside. Its inner {{structure}} including the number of floors could differ from the outward appearance. Castle towers at Himeji, Inuyama, Matsue and Matsumoto Castle have one floor more than is visible from the outside.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00p.m. EDT on August 31, {{the center}} of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been {{completely}} absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern Canada, with no <b>discernible</b> circulation.|$|E
5|$|Birds feature also in {{the mass}} media with iconic {{animated}} cartoon characters such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck, Warner Bros.'s Tweety Pie, and Walter Lantz's Woody Woodpecker. The species involved are not always <b>discernible,</b> though Woody has been claimed {{to be based on the}} acorn or pileated woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Gemological {{laboratories}} {{make use}} of spectrophotometer machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-enhanced diamonds. The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with liquid nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally <b>discernible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Green {{is without}} {{comparison}} the best colour for light troops with dark accouterments; and if put {{on in the}} spring, by autumn it nearly fades with the leaves, preserving its characteristic of being scarcely <b>discernible</b> at a distance.|$|E
5|$|Where {{necessary}} {{some areas}} were retouched in watercolour, {{to integrate the}} pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily <b>discernible</b> as restoration work when viewed close up.|$|E
5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's militia), which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last-ditch militia founded on 18 October 1944. Poorly equipped and trained, the men were sent to fight on the eastern front, where nearly 175,000 of them were killed without having any <b>discernible</b> impact on the Soviet advance.|$|E
5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. The {{divisions of the}} organ became visibly <b>discernible</b> from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on color terminology, with easily <b>discernible</b> {{differences}} between perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 {{a study of}} Zuni color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on color perception. In doing so they began a line of empirical studies that investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely <b>discernible.</b> Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller {{than those of the}} early Chalukyas, a fact <b>discernible</b> in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only <b>discernible</b> on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop's curse had no <b>discernible</b> effect, {{either on}} Urse's career or the castle. Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands, {{including}} some from Evesham Abbey. Urse {{gained a reputation}} for greed and avarice, {{especially with regard to}} church lands. Great Malvern Priory, however, claimed him as a founder in a 14th-century document.|$|E
5|$|The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, {{established}} by the King of Bahrain in June 2011, which found that hundreds of detainees had been subjected to torture {{and other forms of}} physical and psychological abuse, observed a <b>discernible</b> pattern of mistreatment with regard to 14 political leaders including the Bahrain Thirteen. According to the Commission's report, torture at al-Qurain prison, where the Bahrain Thirteen were held, stopped after 10 June.|$|E
5|$|The Sa'iqa company {{achieved}} the only <b>discernible</b> {{success of the}} attack. It managed to land four kilometers east of the fort without facing any aerial resistance (as the company was sailing in civilian fishing boats). The company managed to prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort, destroying a number of tanks and vehicles. It also captured six Israeli soldiers.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking off}} from the ground the flight is ungainly, with much {{flapping}} of wings. The bird's black wingtips are visible while {{it is in the}} air and once it gathers speed, its flight is much more graceful and it often ascends to great heights. Here it may be barely <b>discernible</b> as it wheels in great circles, sometimes emitting its hoarse cry.|$|E
5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little <b>discernible</b> effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became <b>discernible,</b> and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely <b>discernible</b> from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are <b>discernible</b> {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still <b>discernible</b> and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is <b>discernible</b> from other UFO {{religions}} for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E
5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly <b>discernible.</b> At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no <b>discernible</b> activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E
5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the charitable institution, Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and <b>discernible</b> in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no <b>discernible</b> theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
5|$|No <b>discernible</b> {{variation}} in size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females {{are more likely to}} be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} wave became <b>discernible</b> about 800miles (1300km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico, which in the next day developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms. Initially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong upper-level wind shear. Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated. On August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear. With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345miles (555km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no <b>discernible</b> differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no <b>discernible</b> defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|The class {{performed}} well from the outset, {{but there were}} a number of minor modifications over the years. The first ten were built without smoke deflectors, but these were added from August 1931, and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new. Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the Lord Nelson class, Maunsell's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the Schools class. However no <b>discernible</b> improvement to draughting was experienced, and only twenty examples were so modified, the most obvious change in their appearance being the large diameter chimney.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely <b>discernible</b> from the distance as a man-made structure. The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many military operations. During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, {{to keep up with}} the development of arms. The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The highest numbers {{used for}} highway designations include M-553 in the UP and Interstate 696 (I-696) {{running along the}} {{northern}} Detroit suburbs. The lowest numbers in use are M-1 along Woodward Avenue in the Detroit area and US Highway 2 (US2) across the UP. Most M-numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under, but some have been designated in the low 300s. MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time. No <b>discernible</b> pattern exists in Michigan's numbering system, {{although most of the}} M-numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been {{described}} variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a stony meteorite. , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly <b>discernible</b> diffusion banding characteristic of agates.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly <b>discernible</b> through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features}} such as relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E
