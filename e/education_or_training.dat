5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training,</b> meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|In the Middleton Park ward in 2012, at the Foundation Stage (3 to 5 years), 51.6% of {{children}} have a good level of achievement {{and by the end}} of Key Stage 2 (11 years) 69.6% of pupils achieved Level 4 or better. By the age of 16, 32.8% of pupils achieved five or more A-C grades including English and Maths in GCSEs, far less than the Leeds average of 53.4%. In secondary education, 16.5% of pupils are persistent absentees missing 15% or more sessions during the school year and 12.4% of 16- to 18-year-olds are not in employment, <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

25|$|By 1918 French conscripts were {{receiving}} {{no more than}} three months' training and after the war, it was considered that the size of the army should be determined by the number of divisions needed for security. The number of professional soldiers and conscripts necessary was derived by multiplication and the quantity of men was more important than their <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b> In 1920, the CSG decided on 41 active divisions, plus five Algerian and three colonial divisions, with a mobilisation potential of 80 divisions. The government imposed a 32-division limit with 150,000 full-timers but in 1926, the government imposed a limit {{on the size of the}} army of 20 active divisions, with 106,000 professional soldiers to comprise a reservoir of trained men, on which reservists could form a mobilised wartime army. Reducing the size of the active army allowed a reduction in the number of conscripts and the term of compulsory service, from two years to one year by 1928. In 1928 a comprehensive series of laws had been passed for the recruitment and organisation of the army, which determined its peacetime nature; the cadre of professionals maintained the army ready for the mobilisation of a mass of reservists.|$|E
500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the rationale for}} introducing the raising of the participation age (RPA) in learning in England from 2013 and assesses how, if fully implemented, it could contribute to improving the outcomes for young {{people who do not}} participate in any form of post- 16 <b>education,</b> employment <b>or</b> <b>training,</b> and are currently defined as not in <b>education,</b> employment <b>or</b> <b>training</b> (NEET). It considers previous experience of extending young people’s participation in learning, both in the UK and overseas, and draws on evidence from the author’s research on a recent policy initiative targeted at the NEET group. The piloting of activity agreements explored the value of offering a financial incentive, tailored learning and intensive support as mechanisms to re-engage young people in post- 16 <b>education,</b> employment <b>or</b> <b>training.</b> Faced by a lack of enforcement; the necessary levels of investment in support mechanisms to engage with young people and to sustain their participation in learning; and innovative approaches to post- 16 learning, the article concludes that the RPA will, in effect, be allowed to ‘wither on the vine’...|$|R

2500|$|In July 2014, {{the board}} filed a 202-page {{complaint}} against Burzynski to the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings.

Citing examples {{of problems with}} 29 patients, which were listed in the document, the board said that [...] "unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy" [...] were prescribed [...] "in ways that caused harm to several patients." [...] In July 2015, Burzynski's counsel, Richard Jaffe, withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest, a result of Jaffe pursuing actions against Burzynski in bankruptcy court. With the addition of replacement counsel, the hearing was set to begin in November 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Union general William Tecumseh Sherman {{called him}} [...] "that devil Forrest" [...] during wartime {{communications}} with Ulysses S. Grant and considered him [...] "the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side". He {{is considered one}} of the Civil War's most brilliant tacticians. Without military <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training,</b> he became the scourge of Grant, Sherman, and almost every other Union general who fought in Tennessee, Alabama, or Kentucky. Forrest fought by simple rules: he maintained that [...] "war means fighting and fighting means killing" [...] and that the way to win was [...] "to get there first with the most men". His cavalry, which Sherman reported in disgust [...] "could travel one hundred miles in less time it takes ours to travel ten", secured more Union guns, horses, and supplies than any other single Confederate unit. He played pivotal roles at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, the capture of Murfreesboro, the Franklin-Nashville campaign, Brice's Cross Roads, and in pursuit and capture of Colonel Streight's Raiders.|$|E
2500|$|Medical diploma mills have operated, {{and have}} been blacklisted, in the United States for over 120years. The country {{does not have a}} federal law that would {{unambiguously}} prohibit diploma mills, and the term [...] "university" [...] is not legally protected on a national level. The United States Department of Education lacks direct plenary authority to regulate schools and, consequently, the quality of an institution's degree. However, the Federal Trade Commission works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those in the field of education and alerts United States' consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page. [...] Under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by representing themselves as seminaries, since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Dee {{promoted}} the sciences of navigation and cartography. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator, and he owned an important collection of maps, globes and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments {{as well as}} special navigational techniques for use in polar regions. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation. He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than Francis Bacon, though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere {{of the reign of}} James I. It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view. Dee's promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement. As with most of his writings, Dee chose to write in English, rather than Latin, to make his writings accessible to the general public. His [...] "Mathematical Preface" [...] to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the [...] "mecanicians": the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{education}} in England {{is the responsibility}} of the Secretary of State for Education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools {{is the responsibility of}} local authorities. Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944. Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen, and in England youngsters must stay in <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> until they are 18. In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science. The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Two of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 were state-run grammar schools. In 2010, over half of places at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge were taken by students from state schools, while the proportion of children in England attending private schools is around 7% which rises to 18% of those over 16. England has the two oldest universities in English-speaking world, Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (jointly known as [...] "Oxbridge") with history of over eight centuries. The United Kingdom trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 100 universities.|$|E
