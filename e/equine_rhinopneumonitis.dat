40|$|To date, {{vaccination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient methods of prevention against equine infectious diseases. The vaccinology session, which was organised during the annual meeting of the French Equine Veterinarians Association (AVEF) at Reims (France) in 2016, aimed to approach three subjects of importance for the equine industry. Vaccination against three major equine diseases were used as examples: equine influenza (<b>equine</b> influenza virus), <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> (<b>equine</b> herpes virus 1 / 4), and tetanus (Clostridium tetani neuro-toxin). (1) Emergency vaccination: while it has been very successful to reduce the impact of equine influenza epizooties and it is also recommended for tetanus in case of surgery and accident, the benefit of emergency vaccination against equine herpes virus 1 / 4 remains arguable; (2) Compatibility of equine vaccines from different brands: despite being a frequent concerns for equine veterinarians, little information is available about the compatibility of equine vaccines from different commercial origins. The consequence of mixing different equine vaccines targeting the same disease is believed to be limited but scientific evidences are sparse; and, (3) Laps vaccination and vaccine shortage: they could have serious consequences in terms of protection and their impact should be evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account the risk of contact with the pathogen and the effect on herd immunity...|$|R
40|$|Absrrucr. During an {{outbreak}} of abortion caused by equine herpesvirus 1, a neurologic disease characterized clinically by dullness and ataxia occurred in several mares. Equine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from brain and lung of two severely affected mares. Histologically, both mares had disseminated meningoencephalomyelitis characterized by necrotizing arteritis, focal malacia in grey and white matter of brain and spinal cord, and accumulation of lymphocytes and neutrophils in paravertebral ganglia. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies occurred in foci of necrosis in thyroid adenomas of both mares. Equine herpesvirus 1, the causative agent of equine viral abortion and <b>equine</b> viral <b>rhinopneumonitis,</b> occurs worldwide [3, 11, 161. Infection of young horses usually results in a mild respiratory disease, whereas infection of pregnant mares frequently results in abortion at 6 - 10 months. It is espe-cially hazardous in breeding stables where abortion storms may occur. Re-spiratory and abortigenic diseases usually do not occur concurrently in the same animal or on the same premises [131, and aborting animals rarely hav...|$|R
40|$|Using two known {{positive}} <b>equine</b> viral <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> (EVR) sera, conjugates {{were prepared}} with fluorescein isothiocyanate and tested for specificity using EVR infected tissue culture cells. The conjugate was then applied to selected tissues from 32 aborted fetuses and foals submitted during a natural outbreak of EVR. Antigen was detected in various tissues by immunofluorescence in 20 cases (62. 5 %). In 24 cases bovine fetal kidney cell monolayers were inoculated {{with a pool}} of lung and liver and EVR virus was isolated from 15 (62. 5 %). Histological examination of various tissues from 29 cases resulted in the diagnosis of EVR in 19 (65. 5 %), based upon the presence of focal areas of necrosis and intranuclear inclusion bodies. Correlation of results was not obtained in two cases. One was diagnosed positive histologically and negative on fluorescence, the other was negative histologically and by virus isolation but showed fluorescence. The distribution of fluorescence in various infected fetal tissues indicated that the combined examination of lung and thymus gland was most likely to provide a positive diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this general}} article is {{presented}} {{the situation of}} <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> in Chile from 1969, when a long and heavy outbreak of abortion occurred at the Central Zone of the country, causing serious losses in thoroughbred. After a program of immunization iniciated in 1974 by using a modified live vaccine (Rhinomune), <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> decreased gradually. Equine herpes virus type 1 was isolated from liver of aborted fetuses and nasal or ocular discharges of sick adult horses. In 1984 the virus was isolated again from aborted fetuses belong to Victoria, IX Region of Chile; {{this is the only}} case of <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> described at the south of the country. Moreover, different studies were done about the use of complement fixation test, viral seroneutralization, passive haemag glutination test and direct fluorescent technique to diagnose equine rhinopneumonitis; adaptation of the virus in guinea pigs and post vaccinal response to modified and inactivated vaccines against this disease.

40|$|A {{complement}} fixation (CF) antigen for <b>equine</b> herpes- 1 (<b>rhinopneumonitis)</b> virus (EHV 1) of cell culture origin was studied, and an optimum {{method of preparation}} in a minimum volume of serum-free overlay fluid developed. Many chemical and physical treatments including fluorocarbon extraction, tweenether treatment, Carbowax concentration or ultracentrifugation (25, 000 g) did not further {{improve the quality of}} this antigen. Inactivation (56 °C for 30 minutes) of equine serum did not affect the CF antibody titre, but removed low levels of anti-complementary activity. The use of a diluent of low ionic strength (0. 1 m) did not increase titres in the EHV 1 -equine antibody CF system. This EHV 1 CF antigen of cell culture origin was used in a microtitre system and detected the development of antibodies in all of six young horses in Queensland following natural EHV 1 respiratory infection. Maximum serum titres (1 / 128) were reached 1 - 2 weeks after the onset of acute respiratory disease, then CF titres declined steadily but were still detectable after 12 months. Serum titres of 1 / 16 - 1 / 32 or higher indicated EHV 1 infection to have occurred within the previous 3 - 6 months...|$|R

40|$|From {{outbreaks}} of upper respiratory infection of {{horses in the}} Toronto area between 1960 and 1963, several viruses have been isolated. The viruses, isolated in tissue cultures or eggs, include an equine strain of Myxovirus parainfluenzae 3; two strains of equine influenza virus, A/equi- 1 /Prague/ 56, and A/equi- 2 /Miami/ 63; <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> virus, and two newly recognized viruses of the horse, equine rhinoviruses. In addition serological evidence suggested a widespread infection with these viruses in the population under study. Because of the identical clinical picture seen and the complex etiology of the disease, immunization against upper respiratory disease of the horse {{does not appear to}} be completely feasible at this time...|$|E
40|$|An agent which {{possessed the}} {{properties}} of herpesviruses was isolated from the leukocytes of 71 out of 80 (88. 7 %) apparently normal Iowa horses. It was ether- and heat-sensitive, DNA type, and produced type-A intranuclear inclusion bodies in cell cultures. Electron micrographs revealed a virion of typical herpesvirus structure. Leukocyte isolate virus could be differentiated from <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> virus (ERV) by serum neutralization, by growth differences in rabbit kidney cells, and by fluorescent antibody staining. Specific neutralizing antibody against this agent {{was found in a}} pooled serum sample from normal horses and in the serums of herpesvirus carrier horses. Serum from a mare inhibited growth of both ERV and leukocyte viral isolates. Normal sheep, calf, and rabbit serum did not neutralize either virus...|$|E
40|$|Infections by equine {{herpesvirus}} (EHV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) {{have been}} associated with important economic losses for the equine industry worldwide. Serological studies have indicated the presence of these agents in Brazil. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the occurrence of specific antibodies against EAV and EHV in horse herds from different regions of Rio de Janeiro state. For this purpose, serum samples of 581 non-vaccinated animals and 44 breeding mares regularly vaccinated against <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> were collected. All samples were submitted to the virus neutralization test for the detection of specific antibodies to each virus. Results showed 29. 6 % (172 / 581) of seropositive animals for EHV (titers between 2 and ≥ 256) and 0. 79 % (5 / 630) for EAV (titers between 2 and 4, 096). Considering the non-vaccinated animals, these findings demonstrated that specific antibodies were induced after natural exposure to the respective viruses, suggesting a probable circulation of these agents in the studied herds...|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (PBL) from cattle immunized or infected with {{infectious bovine rhinotracheitis}} (IBR) virus were cultured in vitro with ultraviolet light-inactivated IBR virus, {{and the degree of}} lymphocyte blastogenesis was quantitated by measurement of the uptake of [3 H]thymidine into acid-insoluble material. Lymphocyte blastogenesis only occurred with PBL from immunized or infected animals. The optimal conditions for lymphocyte blastogenesis were defined. Blastogenesis was specific since cells from animals immunized against IBR failed to react with two other herpesvirus antigens tested, herpes simplex and <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> viruses. Blastogenesis could be prevented by reacting IBR antigen with IBR-specific antibody before adding to cultures, but incorporating IBR-specific antibody in the culture medium after adding free antigen failed to inhibit blastogenesis. With intranasally infected animals, lymphocyte blastogenesis was detectable after 5 days, reached peak levels between days 7 and 10, and then declined to low levels by day 19. In contrast, levels of neutralizing antibody were barely detectable on day 7 and reached maximal concentrations on day 19. The lymphocyte blastogenesis assay was emphasized as a convenient and useful in vitro correlate of cell-mediated immunity that should help define the role of cell-mediated immunity in immunity to herpesviruses...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{activity of}} 5 -methoxymethyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (MMUdR) was {{compared with that}} of 5 -iodo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (IUdR), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and adenine arabinoside (Ara-A). At concentrations of 2 to 4 μg/ml, MMUdR was inhibitory to herpes simplex virus type 1, but concentrations as high as 128 μg/ml were not inhibitory to three other herpesviruses tested (<b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> virus, murine cytomegalovirus, and feline rhinopneumonitis virus) or to vaccinia virus. The other nucleosides, in contrast, were inhibitory at similar concentrations (1 to 8 μg/ml) against all viruses tested. The inhibition of HSV- 1 by MMUdR appeared {{to be the result of}} interference with virus replication rather than the result of drug toxicity to host cells. The drug was not toxic to host cells at 100 times the antiviral concentrations, and pretreatment of host cells with high concentrations of MMUdR had no effect on subsequent virus replication. Combination of MMUdR with either IUdR, Ara-A, or Ara-C gave an enhanced antiviral effect, suggesting that the mechanism of action of MMUdR is different from that of the other three drugs. Antiviral indexes were calculated for each compound and were found to be > 250, 80, 40, and 8 for MMUdR, IUdR, Ara-A, and Ara-C, respectively. These were defined as the minimum dose at which toxicity was observed microscopically divided by the dose which reduced plaque numbers by 50 %...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{serological}} {{diagnosis of}} equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV 4; <b>equine</b> <b>rhinopneumonitis</b> virus) and EHV 1 (equine abortion virus) hitherto {{has not been}} possible because of extensive antigenic cross-reactivity between these two closely related but distinct viruses. Recently, we identified EHV 4 glycoprotein G (gG) and characterized it as a type-specific, secreted glycoprotein (B. S. Crabb, H. S. Nagesha, and M. J. Studdert, Virology 190 : 143 - 154, 1992). This paper shows that EHV 1 gG also possesses type-specific epitopes and describes the localization of strong, type-specific epitopes to the apparently corresponding and highly variable regions comprising amino acids 287 to 382 of EHV 4 gG and 288 to 350 of EHV 1 gG. Fusion proteins expressing these variable regions reacted strongly and type specifically with sera from four foals, three of which were colostrum-deprived, specific-pathogen-free foals, whose history with respect to exposure to EHV 4 or EHV 1 was well-defined. These antigens {{provided the basis for}} the development of a single-well diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to distinguish horses infected with EHV 4, EHV 1, or both. Such a type-specific test provides for the first time the opportunity to differentiate antibodies to these viruses, and it has, therefore, important implications for understanding the epidemiology of these equine pathogens. Evidence for the existence of EHV 1 in Australia 10 years prior to the first confirmed case of EHV 1 abortion is presented...|$|E
