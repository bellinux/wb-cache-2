He now works for Kevin as part of Hare-Link and is married to George's former wife Martha. Another is Daisy, a daisy plant made intelligent by the GBC. It lives with the Dewclaws as a pet, having the same intelligence as a dog or cat in our world.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the <b>fennec</b> fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) <b>fennec</b> fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or <b>fennec</b> fox, birds such as the desert lark or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} {{previously}} {{classified in the}} genus Fennecus, but has since been reclassified to the genus Vulpes which includes {{a variety of other}} types of foxes. Scientists have noted that while there are similarities, there are many differences that set the <b>fennec</b> fox apart from other fox species, including both physical and social traits. This has led to two conflicting classifications: Vulpes zerda, implying that the <b>fennec</b> fox is a true fox, and Fennecus zerda, implying that the <b>fennec</b> fox belongs to its own genus.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} able to live without free water, as its kidneys are adapted to {{restrict}} water loss. A <b>fennec's</b> burrowing can cause the formation of dew. They are also known to absorb water through food consumption; but will drink water if available.|$|R
25|$|Current {{statistics}} on population are not known, but {{the population is}} assumed to be adequate based on observations of traders commonly trapping <b>fennec</b> foxes in Northern Africa for exhibition or sale to tourists.

Other possible predators include caracals, jackals, striped hyenas, and the saluki, a greyhound-like domestic dog local to the area.

25|$|The <b>fennec</b> fox or <b>fennec</b> (Vulpes zerda) {{is a small}} nocturnal fox {{found in}} the Sahara of North Africa. Its most {{distinctive}} feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Arabic word فنك (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat. The <b>fennec</b> is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. In addition, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.|$|E
