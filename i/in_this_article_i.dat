50|$|Several key themes recur in {{the short}} {{narratives}} contained. One subject is matrimony, a particularly prevalent topos in Lusophone Goan writing for the discussion of caste identities and social mores. In stories such as “Ferdinando,” “De Mal a Pior” or “Um Diário e Duas Cartas” these perennial machinations are depicted {{within the context of}} a society undergoing deep social shifts that render these compacts even more fraught. Another subset of tales focuses on the breakdown of traditional rural society, featuring Hindu characters in the main and striking a similar tone to Pundalik Naik’s Konkani-language novel Upheaval, perhaps the most prominent Goan novel to deal with this subject. These stories include “Uma Filha da Terra” and “Munu.” <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> shall focus on the third subgroup, represented by “Os javalis de Codval,” “O navio encalhado,” “História de minas,” “Outra história de minas” and “No comboio.” All of these narratives involve in some way a journey out into uncertainty, a setting forth in search of wealth, security or merely sustenance that ends in some sort of reversal. Both the journeys and the conditions under which they are undertaken resonate with the social, economic and political changes occurring in Goa at the time in which the stories are set.|$|E

Although most consumers consider the firms' products to be perfect substitutes, an arbitrarily small number of "captive" consumers display brand loyalty to a particular firm, even when the competing brand is cheaper. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> <b>I</b> show that a firm with even slightly fewer captive consumers than its competitor achieves monopoly power over all remaining consumers. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> {{investigate}} the internal syntax of Dutch nominal expressions like twee slangen van elk twee meter (two snakes of each two meter). The preposition van separates the quantifier elk from the expression twee slangen {{to which it}} is connected interpretatively. From a purely observational view, the quantifier could be said to be floating in the nominal domain. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> argue that this floating elk is an instance of so-called ‘binominal each’. So far, discussions of the binominal-each-phenomenon have concentrated on dependencies involving material in the clausal domain. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> show that dependencies involving binominal elk are also attested DP-internally. Syntactic issues that will be discussed {{in the context of the}} DP-internal binominal-each-phenomenon include: Constituency of the nominal expression, the nature of the DP-internal anaphoric dependency, the various manifestations of the binominal pattern, and word order rearrangements by DP-internal displacemen...|$|E
