Although this victory temporarily secured Edward's position on the throne, he was eventually deposed in 1326 by Roger Mortimer, {{with the help of the}} king's wife, Isabella of France.

5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites <b>impinge</b> on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E

40|$|The test {{specimens}} of NiCrBSi coating were prepared using the high velocity oxy-fuel spraying technique with a post-thermal treatment. Their high-speed slurry erosion characteristics have been systematically studied. SUS {{304 stainless steel}} {{was selected as the}} comparison material. Experimental results show that the NiCrBSi sprayed coating exhibits a much better slurry erosion resistance than the SUS 304 stainless steel. The erosion rate for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating slightly increases with the <b>impinged</b> angle. However, a maximum erosion rate appears at an <b>impinged</b> angle of around 30 degrees for SUS 304 stainless steel. Both NiCrBSi sprayed coating and SUS 304 stainless steel exhibit <b>impinged</b> surfaces with lots of furrows at an <b>impinged</b> angle of 30 degrees. At a high <b>impinged</b> angle of 90 degrees, the SUS 304 stainless steel exhibits an <b>impinged</b> surface with lots of overlapping and irregular concavities, while, these features are less obvious for NiCrBSi sprayed coating. The hardness of SUS 304 stainless steel increases significantly with increasing <b>impinged</b> angle during the high-speed slurry erosion. But, there is no obvious work hardening for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating due to its extra-high hardness and less plastic deformation, even at a high <b>impinged</b> angle of 90 degrees.

40|$|The {{flow and}} {{temperature}} fields {{caused by a}} two-dimensional heating air jet obliquely <b>impinging</b> on a flat plate are experimentally characterized. Whilst the jet flow is discharged at Re(Dh) = 8. 2 X 10 (3) based on the hydraulic diameter of the orifice, D(h), and the jet exit-to-plate spacing (separation distance) is fixed at 8 D(h). the impingement angle (inclination) is systematically decreased from 90 degrees (normal <b>impinging)</b> to 30, (oblique <b>impinging).</b> A separate experiment is carried out for a two-dimensional cooling jet obliquely <b>impinging</b> on a heated plate (constant heat flux). The results demonstrate that the response of local surface temperature to plate inclination behaves {{in a completely different}} manner. For <b>impinging</b> jet cooling, the inclination (from normal <b>impinging</b> position) reduces the local effective temperature values at corresponding points about actual stagnation point, inclusive of it. For <b>impinging</b> jet heating, the inclination causes, conversely, an increase in local surface temperature including the stagnation point temperature. However, the shifting of the actual stagnation point towards the uphill side of the plate is consistently observed for both hot and cold jet cases. This newly found feature for an obliquely <b>impinging</b> jet is attributed to the combined effects of asymmetric entrainment and momentum redistribution (i. e., thickening/thinning of hydraulic boundary layers {{on each side of the}} plate with respect to the actual stagnation point).

30|$|In the {{application}} of jet impingements, circular or slot jets are the main jet configurations. For these two configurations, flow and heat transfer mechanics are significantly different. It seems that greater research activity on heat and mass transfer with circular <b>impinging</b> jets has been predominantly published [1 – 3, 15, 16]. However, investigations on heat and mass transfer with slot jet impingement have attracted more attention recently. In fact, slot jet impingements offer many more beneficial features, such as higher cooling effectiveness, greater uniformity and more controllability, as underlined in [17]. For example, these factors allow for fulfillment of the increasing heat flux and decreasing dimensions in electronics packages [17 – 24]. The common types of <b>impinging</b> jets are with or without confinement. Confined <b>impinging</b> jets have the advantages of smaller space design, while unconfined <b>impinging</b> jets have an advantage of simple design and easy fabrication. The two types of <b>impinging</b> jets have their own merits, and they are both commonly used as the cooling solutions, and the literature reviews on the subject have been provided in [2, 3, 6]. The effects of confinement on <b>impinging</b> jet heat transfer have been considered in [25 – 27]. Moreover, several studies show {{the importance of the}} subject and different cases have been investigated, such as confined slot-jet impingement on a moving plate [28], <b>impinging</b> jet on obliquely a flat surface [29], <b>impinging</b> jet on a porous medium [30] and slot jet impingement cooling on a semi-circular concave [31].|$|R

25|$|The {{reason for}} ethidium bromide's intense {{fluorescence}} after binding with DNA {{is probably not}} due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl , because the phenyl ring {{has been shown to}} project outside the intercalated bases.

Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it.

Effects of an external perturbation on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the transitional <b>impinging</b> jet have been examined. Oscillatory behaviour induced by the external perturbation has been observed for the <b>impinging</b> jet. The external perturbation leads to the large-scale vortical structures in the primary jet stream, which subsequently lead to the strong oscillatory behaviour of the <b>impinging</b> jet. The vortical structures lead to flow transitional behaviour that enhances mixing of the hot jet with the ambient fluid. It has been observed that the wall boundary layer of the <b>impinging</b> jet is thin. Both the instantaneous and time-averaged wall shear and normal stresses and Nusselt number are examined. Although the external perturbation strongly affects the flow structures in the primary jet stream, {{it does not have}} significant effects on the wall stresses and heat transfer characteristics of the <b>impinging</b> jet due to the re-laminarization effect of the wall.

25|$|Higher {{gains were}} sought than those {{available}} from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to <b>impinge</b> on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages.|$|E
