40|$|The {{sense that}} 'something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> it', {{which is a}} form of gut feelings, is {{frequently}} mentioned in judgements made by medical disciplinary tribunals as reported in the Dutch medical journal Medisch Contact. Since judgements made by these tribunals are regarded as setting the standard for good professional practice, we investigated {{the way in which they}} include and evaluate these feelings when making judgements. Exploratory, descriptive investigation. A search was performed for the term 'niet-pluis' ('something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> it') in medical tribunal databases and the Medisch Contact archives for the period 2000 - 2008. The tribunal judgements found were analysed and classified. A feeling that 'something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> it' was mentioned in judgements in 34 cases, all relating to situations involving diagnostic uncertainty or diagnostic mistakes. In almost every case this involved potential or actual serious damage to health. In 19 cases disciplinary action was imposed in the final judgement. Disciplinary tribunals regarded the sense of 'something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> it' as a diagnostic instrument. This should be objectified by taking a detailed case history and carrying out a physical examination and should be recorded in the files. Medical disciplinary tribunals regarded the sense of 'something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> it' as part of the professional standar...|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} National Treasures {{writings}} that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> {{in any of}} the above categories, all originating in China. Two are 7th century works: a copy of the Thousand Character Classic by Zhi Yong both in formal and cursive scripts, and a tracing copy of a letter by the famous Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi. The former work {{is said to have been}} imported to Japan by the legendary scholar Wani in ancient times. One is a 13th-century set of large-scale letters (2 or 3 each) to be displayed on walls or above doorways.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mindâ€“body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to RenÃ© Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four generaâ€”a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is {{induced by the}} discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E
