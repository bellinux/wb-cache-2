The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year. During his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders while harnessing the power of summoning Persona. The game features a weather <b>forecast</b> <b>system</b> with events happening on foggy days to replace the moon phase system implemented in the previous games.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global <b>Forecast</b> <b>System</b> model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

In the special case when the expert is not available the new Bayesian <b>forecasting</b> <b>system</b> simplifies to the standard Bayesian forecasting which suggests its fundamental character.

500|$|As {{early as}} October23, while Sandy was {{developing}} in the Caribbean, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicted the storm would strike the East Coast of the United States, while most other tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the storm would move out to sea. By the next day, various computer models agreed that Sandy would interact with a trough over the eastern United States {{and turn to}} the west. About five days before landfall, the ECMWF, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) models predicted Sandy would strike the Delmarva Peninsula, while the American Global <b>Forecast</b> <b>System</b> (GFS) model anticipated the hurricane would move out to sea; the remaining models were between the two scenarios. By four days before landfall, the NHC was forecasting a landfall on New Jersey, as were most of the computer models. In general, the European computer models performed better than the United States ones, due to the European models' higher resolution. MIT professor Kerry Emanuel used the moment {{to call attention to}} the under-performance of US models, and to recommend a [...] "dedicated effort" [...] to reverse it.|$|E
500|$|During 1972, {{the first}} model to {{forecast}} storm surge along the continental shelf of the United States was developed, known as the Special Program to List the Amplitude of Surges from Hurricanes (SPLASH). [...] In 1978, the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics – the movable fine-mesh (MFM) model – began operating. [...] The Quasi-Lagrangian Limited Area (QLM) model is a multi-level primitive equation model using a Cartesian grid and the Global <b>Forecast</b> <b>System</b> (GFS) for boundary conditions. [...] In the early 1980s, the assimilation of satellite-derived winds from water vapor, infrared, and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting. [...] The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid-1980s. [...] Once {{it was determined that}} it could show skill in hurricane prediction, a multi-year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the National Weather Service for both track and intensity forecasting in 1995. [...] By 1985, the Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model had been developed for use in areas of the Gulf of Mexico and near the United States' East coast, which was more robust than the SPLASH model.|$|E
500|$|The National Meteorological Center's Global Spectral Model was {{introduced}} during August 1980. [...] The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model debuted on May 1, 1985. [...] The United Kingdom Met Office {{has been running}} their global model since the late 1980s, adding a 3D-Var data assimilation scheme in mid-1999. [...] The Canadian Meteorological Centre has been running a global model since 1991. The United States ran the Nested Grid Model (NGM) from 1987 to 2000, with some features lasting as late as 2009. [...] Between 2000 and 2002, the Environmental Modeling Center ran the Aviation (AVN) model for shorter range forecasts and the Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model at longer time ranges. [...] During this time, the AVN model was extended {{to the end of}} the forecast period, eliminating the need of the MRF and thereby replacing it. [...] In late 2002, the AVN model was renamed the Global <b>Forecast</b> <b>System</b> (GFS). [...] The German Weather Service has been running their global hydrostatic model, the GME, using a hexagonal icosohedral grid since 2002. The GFS is slated to eventually be supplanted by the Flow-following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM), which like the GME is gridded on a truncated icosahedron, in the mid-2010s.|$|E

A lot of forecasting models have been developed in recent years {{but none of them}} could consistently outperform the others.

[...] A similar model was developed for the northwest Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere known as the Statistical Intensity Prediction System (STIPS), which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) model. [...] The version of SHIPS with an inland decay component is known as Decay SHIPS (DSHIPS). [...] The Logistic Growth Equation Model (LGEM) uses the same input as SHIPS but within a simplified dynamical prediction system. [...] Within tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting, the Rainfall Climatology and Persistence (r-CLIPER) model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land, {{to come up with}} a realistic rainfall distribution for tropical cyclones based on the National Hurricane Center's track forecast. [...] It has been operational since 2004.

500|$|According to {{the game}} {{director}} Katsura Hashino, while [...] "ideas [...] thrown around earlier", development on Persona 4 in Japan did not begin until {{after the release of}} Persona 3. The development team consisted of the team from Persona 3 and new hires which included fans of Persona 3. Atlus intended to improve both the gameplay and story elements of Persona 3 for the new game, to ensure it was not seen as a [...] "retread" [...] of its predecessor. Hashino said that [...] "to accomplish that, we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game. The murder mystery plot was our way of doing that." [...] The plot of Persona 4 was [...] "greatly inspired", according to Hashino, by mystery novelists such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and Seishi Yokomizo. Persona 4 was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in March 2008. An article in the issue detailed the game's murder mystery premise, rural setting, and new weather <b>forecast</b> <b>system.</b> The game's North American release date was announced at the 2008 Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California. Atlus would not make an add-on disc or epilogue for Persona 4, as had been done with the Persona 3 FES. Persona 4 allowed players full control of characters in battle. This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in Persona 3 being controlled by the game's AI. The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life, character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc. The anime cutscenes were produced by Studio Hibari.|$|E

The presented articles propose several potential suspects: a series of shocks, the <b>forecasting</b> <b>system</b> and the decision-making system.

These results suggest that deviations of inflation from the target in the past decade cannot be explained by a single factor in the Czech case, and that the role of each factor changed over time. Anti-inflationary shocks are the most frequently identified source of the deviations. In the initial stage of inflation targeting, the <b>forecasting</b> <b>system</b> and the decision-making process also contributed.
