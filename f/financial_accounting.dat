40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the analysis of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> of balance of payments since the mid-nineties to the present. Individual items of the <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> are decribed in the theoretical part. Subsequently the practical part of the thesis focuses on the analysis of all partial items of the <b>financial</b> <b>account.</b> We will find out that foreign direct investments are stable source for capital imports. They have a lot of positive advantages, but we have to also point out the disadvantage of the decline of balance of the primary incomes. Portfolio investments are less stable and it´s appropriate to distinguish them to debt and equity securities. The thesis describes the connection among the items of the <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> (i. e. how the items had an impact on each other) as well.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a different causal relationship {{exists between the}} current and <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> in developed and developing countries. Using the Granger causality test, we clearly determine that the <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> is by and large responsible for the current account in developing countries; instead of financing the current <b>account,</b> the <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> thrusts the current account into an imbalance. In developed countries, however, the current account leads the way, and the <b>financial</b> <b>account,</b> as its name indicates, serves to finance a current account imbalance. This represents a forewarning that countries, which lack a sophisticated financial system to channel funds to proper locations, should not recklessly liberalize capital mobility.

25|$|The {{development}} of joint-stock companies (especially from about 1600) built wider audiences for accounting information, as investors without firsthand {{knowledge of their}} operations relied on accounts to provide the requisite information. This development resulted in a split of accounting systems for internal (i.e. management accounting) and external (i.e. <b>financial</b> <b>accounting)</b> purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent attestation of external accounts by auditors.|$|E

A review released on December 21, 2009, revealed that all of the misplaced gold was fully accounted for. A previously unaccounted 9,350 ounces was attributed to estimation errors, and a further 1,500 ounces was recovered through an extensive refining of slag within the Mint.|$|E
50|$|Absent {{changes in}} {{official}} reserves, {{the current account}} is the {{mirror image of the}} sum of the capital and <b>financial</b> <b>accounts.</b> One might then ask: Is the current account driven by the capital and <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> or is it vice versa? The traditional response is that the current account is the main causal factor, with capital and <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> simply reflecting financing of a deficit or investment of funds arising {{as a result of a}} surplus. However, more recently some observers have suggested that the opposite causal relationship may be important in some cases. In particular, it has controversially been suggested that the United States current account deficit is driven by the desire of international investors to acquire U.S. assets (see Ben Bernanke, William Poole links below). However, the main viewpoint undoubtedly remains that the causative factor is the current account and that the positive <b>financial</b> <b>account</b> reflects the need to finance the country's current account deficit.|$|R
