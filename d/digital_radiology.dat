40|$|In this paper, a <b>digital</b> {{subtraction}} <b>radiology</b> {{scheme is}} presented {{based on a}} new method for the automatic registration of dental radiographs acquired with or without rigorous a priori standardization. The scheme is comprised of an automatic registration method and a subtraction process. The proposed registration method {{can be considered as}} an object-based registration method without imposing the prerequisite of image segmentation in order to detect the boundary of the objects of interest or the automatic detection of matching landmarks. This is achieved by augmenting the dimensionality of the problem from two-dimensional gray-level matching to three-dimensional surface matching using the process of lifting in combination with a surface-matching technique. The pseudo three-dimensional affine transformation that matches the lifted images incorporates advantageous characteristics including spatial alignment of the surfaces, anisotropic correction of brightness/contrast differences, and stable convergence of the similarity function to its optimal value. The performance of the proposed automatic registration method is assessed against a manual method based on the projective transformation. The qualitative and quantitative assessments of the experiments have shown advantageous performance of the proposed automatic registration method against the manual one. Finally, the proposed registration method has been further improved in terms of execution time by the implementation of a surface decimation process. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>digital</b> imaging in <b>radiology,</b> CDRs are increasingly used to distribute patient materials. This study investigates {{the application of a}} new software package and work protocol to integrate out-hospital data into the local PACS (picture archive and communication system) archive, which is hampered by differences in patient numbers. A one-month trial was started to import CD-Rs from two departments (radiotherapy and radiology). Seventy CD-Rs were collected from 20 different hospitals holding data of eight different modality types and published by eight different software packages from different vendors. All CDRs were successfully transferred into the PACS. The new software and work protocol provide an easy way of introducing the out-hospital data into the PACS. CDRs can be destroyed after transfer to PACS, eliminating physical storage. Furthermore, all data can now be viewed and reported using the default viewers of the hospital and no additional training of staff is required...|$|R
