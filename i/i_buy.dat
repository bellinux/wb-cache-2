500|$|The New York Times {{presented}} {{three stories}} that it felt were particularly emotional: {{the first was}} {{about a woman who}} removed miniskirts from her college wardrobe after being raped, but continued wearing her favorite boots; another was about wedding attire anxieties; and the third was about the choice of adorning a newly reconstructed breast with a tattoo. The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> something that isn't black, and I put it on and I am so sorry".|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, the Brewers renewed Braun's {{contract}} for $455,000, a $75,000 increase. Braun then signed an 8-year, $45–$51 million contract extension (the total depending on his [...] "Super 2" [...] service-time ranking after the 2009 season) on May 15, 2008. [...] The contract {{is through the}} year 2015. The deal included Braun's $455,000 salary for 2008, and a $2.3 million bonus in 2008. It could increase to $51 million through incentives. Braun also has a no-trade clause {{for the first four}} years, and then a limited no-trade clause allowing him to block deals to 12 teams from 2012 to 2013, and 6 teams from 2014 to 2015. The contract will keep Braun locked up through his age-31 season. It was the largest contract in Brewers' history, surpassing Jeff Suppan's. It was also the largest contract in baseball history given to a player with less than three years' experience. [...] Braun's agent, Nez Balelo, crunched enough numbers to show him what he potentially could have made over the life of this contract if he had chosen not to sign it. [...] "But the question I ultimately asked myself was, `What can't <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> with that amount of money?"' Braun said.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{commented that}} this episode [...] "felt really flat", citing that the plots [...] "were fine, but {{they needed to}} be taken further" [...] and that they [...] "were almost there, but needed one more pass through the script." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning said that his favorite storyline in the episode was Jack and Frank's, and enjoyed Lupone's role, but noted that the episode [...] "lacked that familiar 30 Rock punch and tight rhythm", and gave the episode a 7.8 out 10 rating. Rick Porter of Zap2it said that [...] "Goodbye, My Friend" [...] had its [...] "usual share of brilliantly funny moments, but I'm not sure whether I can fully get behind an episode that hangs an entire subplot on the subtleties of Harry and the Hendersons." [...] He observed that Liz's [...] "baby fever" [...] came of out of nowhere, as the show had not referenced Liz's desire of becoming a mother for some time. Porter wrote that Jenna's fake injury was mostly a throwaway, [...] "but it did bring my favorite line of the night", in regards to Tracy explaining that he does not have a birth certificate and therefore has never had a birthday. [...] "I don't need it. <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> myself all the presents I need. And because of my drinking, I'm often surprised." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Weeds" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a portrait of a community in fear" [...] that [...] "simmers with recrimination and vigilantism". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that the individual characters lacked personality, as Spotnitz's script [...] "spends {{a lot of time}} introducing figures as potential suspects rather than giving a great deal of depth to any of them". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Weeds" [...] 3 out of 5, noting that [...] "something about [...] just isn't right". Gibron felt that it was [...] "one of the weaker episodes in the series, but it also had some of the greatest potential". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B. Handlen felt that the [...] "black-and-white morality" [...] of [...] "Weeds", and Millennium as a series, was a negative factor, adding [...] "as always with Millennium, there's the feeling that the only life worth living is one entirely free from sin, and I can't say that <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> that". However, Handlen praised C. C. H. Pounder's guest role, finding that she [...] "manages to put herself across quite well" [...] despite the difficulty of standing out amidst the series' sombre tone.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Burleson, Clarkson {{was encouraged by}} her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series [...] in May 2002. Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK but America {{is a very different}} market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do <b>I</b> <b>buy?</b> White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress." [...] Clarkson {{went on to win the}} competition on September 4, 2002 at the then Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini and without being sent into the bottom three throughout the season.|$|E
