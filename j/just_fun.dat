500|$|... "Get Back" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, and {{produced}} by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields. Lovato {{wanted to write a}} song about getting back together with someone, as she believed enough mean and heartbroken songs had already been made. She said, [...] "It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's kind of <b>just</b> <b>fun</b> to sing to the person that I wrote it about." [...] The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co-producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. The edited Radio Disney version was released on the same day.|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} The Cataracs, a group that consists of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, who also produced the track. Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was {{for me to make}} a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} and I met them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were <b>just</b> <b>fun.</b> It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{describes}} the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies {{in which she}} would like to engage, asking her lover playfully to [...] "touch her body". Though the song features sexually oriented lyrics, critics deemed that the melody and playful tone of the song made them less explicit. The song's lyrics find Carey maintaining the duo keep the relationship private from the media, as she threatens to [...] "hunt him down" [...] if he shall record anything of their private life. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, [...] "Touch My Body" [...] is a [...] "questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette", with Carey singing [...] "If there's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube." [...] Critic Rodman felt the song's lyrics describe the protagonist's sexual fantasies, but also serves as a warning to [...] "potential touchers: 'If you run your mouth and brag about our secret rendezvous / I will hunt you down.' Yikes!" [...] In an interview with Fox News, journalist Hollie McKay asked Carey if there was any literal interpretation regarding the lyrics [...] "Touch My Body / Put Me on the Floor / Wrestle Me Around / Play With Me Some More", to which she replied [...] "There is no full-blown meaning; it is just cute and it's one of those songs that makes me happy. I wasn't taking it that seriously. It was <b>just</b> <b>fun</b> experience." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote that in the song [...] "Mariah coos soft-core phone sex fantasies over plinked piano notes, all while referencing YouTube in {{what appears to be a}} desperate grab for relevance." [...] In his review of the song's parent album, Los Angeles Times critic Richard Hartog described the song's production, Carey's vocals and its overall mixing: ...|$|E

And you know I know you stole that from me, right?" [...] Rico Love commented on the recording sessions of the song {{in an interview with}} magazine Rap-Up, saying that [...] "it was a really interesting situation because of the history that was in the room and the energy was so positive. It was electric. I really wanted to try my best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. Â´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, just showing their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers. It was an amazing energy, an amazing vibe. The girls were all positive. It was <b>just</b> <b>fun.</b> We had a great time and I learned so much from both of them during the session." [...] Love also revealed that they did alternate versions of the song for both Monica and Brandy's albums. He noted that the changes were minimal.|$|E

I'm sure you've guessed--only you didn't want to know--that--did you?--when you didn't love me. That's why you were lying--but I saw, I knew! Oh, I'm not blaming you, darling. How could I--never! You mustn't look so--so frightened. I know how you felt, dear. I've--I've watched you. It was just a flirtation for you at first. Wasn't it? Oh, I know. It was <b>just</b> <b>fun,</b> and---- Please don't look at me so. I'm not hurting you, am I? I wouldn't for worlds, dear--you know--hurt you! And then afterwards--you found we could be such good friends--helping each other--and you wanted it to stay just like that always, didn't you?--I know--and then I had to spoil it all--and {{fall in love with}} you--didn't I? Oh, it was stupid--I shouldn't--I couldn't help it, you were so kind and--and different--and I wanted to share in your work and--and everything. I knew you wouldn't want to know I loved you--when you didn't--and I tried hard to be fair and hide my love so you wouldn't see--and I did, didn't I, dear?

6000|$|I LET {{myself in}} at the kitchen door. [...] "It's you," [...] she said. [...] "I can't get up. Forgive me [...] Not {{answering}} your knock. I can no more [...] Let people in than I can keep them out. [...] I'm getting too old for my size, I tell them. [...] My fingers are about all I've the use of [...] So's to take any comfort. I can sew: [...] I help out with this beadwork what I can." [...] "That's a smart pair of pumps you're beading there. [...] Who are they for?" [...] "You mean?--oh, for some miss. [...] I can't keep track of other people's daughters. [...] Lord, if I were to dream of everyone [...] Whose shoes I primped to dance in!" [...] "And where's John?" [...] "Haven't you seen him? Strange what set you off [...] To come to his house when he's gone to yours. [...] You can't have passed each other. I know what: [...] He must have {{changed his mind and}} gone to Garlands. [...] He won't be long in that case. You can wait. [...] Though what good you can be, or anyone-- [...] It's gone so far. You've heard? Estelle's run off." [...] "Yes, what's it all about? When did she go?" [...] "Two weeks since." [...] "She's in earnest, it appears." [...] "I'm sure she won't come back. She's hiding somewhere. [...] I don't know where myself. John thinks I do. [...] He thinks I only have to say the word, [...] And she'll come back. But, bless you, I'm her mother-- [...] I can't talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!" [...] "It will go hard with John. What will he do? [...] He can't find anyone to take her place." [...] "Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do? [...] He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together, [...] With me to sit and tell him everything, [...] What's wanted and how much and where it is. [...] But when I'm gone--of course I can't stay here: [...] Estelle's to take me when she's settled down. [...] He and I only hinder one another. [...] I tell them they can't get me through the door, though: [...] I've been built in here like a big church organ. [...] We've been here fifteen years." [...] "That's a long time [...] To live together and then pull apart. [...] How do you see him living when you're gone? [...] Two of you out will leave an empty house." [...] "I don't just see him living many years, [...] Left here with nothing but the furniture. [...] I hate to think of the old place when we're gone, [...] With the brook going by below the yard, [...] And no one here but hens blowing about. [...] If he could sell the place, but then, he can't: [...] No one will ever live on it again. [...] It's too run down. This is the last of it. [...] What I think he will do, is let things smash. [...] He'll sort of swear the time away. He's awful! [...] I never saw a man let family troubles [...] Make so much difference in his man's affairs. [...] He's just dropped everything. He's like a child. [...] I blame his being brought up by his mother. [...] He's got hay down that's been rained on three times. [...] He hoed a little yesterday for me: [...] I thought the growing things would do him good. [...] Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe [...] Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now-- [...] Come here--I'll show you--in that apple tree. [...] That's no way for a man to do at his age: [...] He's fifty-five, you know, if he's a day." [...] "Aren't you afraid of him? What's that gun for?" [...] "Oh, that's been there for hawks since chicken-time. [...] John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends. [...] I'll say that for him, John's no threatener [...] Like some men folk. No one's afraid of him; [...] All is, he's made up his mind not to stand [...] What he has got to stand." [...] "Where is Estelle? [...] Couldn't one talk to her? What does she say? [...] You say you don't know where she is." [...] "Nor want to! [...] She thinks if it was bad to live with him, [...] It must be right to leave him." [...] "Which is wrong!" [...] "Yes, but he should have married her." [...] "I know." [...] "The strain's been too much for her all these years: [...] I can't explain it any other way. [...] It's different with a man, at least with John: [...] He knows he's kinder than the run of men. [...] Better than married ought to be as good [...] As married--that's what he has always said. [...] I know the way he's felt--but all the same!" [...] "I wonder why he doesn't marry her [...] And end it." [...] "Too late now: she wouldn't have him. [...] He's given her time to think of something else. [...] That's his mistake. The dear knows my interest [...] Has been to keep the thing from breaking up. [...] This is a good home: I don't ask for better. [...] But when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,' [...] He'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that." [...] "And after all why should they? John's been fair [...] I take it. What was his was always hers. [...] There was no quarrel about property." [...] "Reason enough, there was no property. [...] A friend or two as good as own the farm, [...] Such as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage." [...] "I mean Estelle has always held the purse." [...] "The rights of that are harder to get at. [...] I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. [...] 'Twas we let him have money, not he us. [...] John's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him. [...] Take it year in, year out, he doesn't make much. [...] We came here for a home for me, you know, [...] Estelle to do the housework for the board [...] Of both of us. But look how it turns out: [...] She seems to have the housework, and besides, [...] Half of the outdoor work, though as for that, [...] He'd say she does it more because she likes it. [...] You see our pretty things are all outdoors. [...] Our hens and cows and pigs are always better [...] Than folks like us have any business with. [...] Farmers around twice as well off as we [...] Haven't as good. They don't go with the farm. [...] One thing you can't help liking about John, [...] He's fond of nice things--too fond, some would say. [...] But Estelle don't complain: she's like him there. [...] She wants our hens to be the best there are. [...] You never saw this room before a show, [...] Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds [...] In separate coops, having their plumage done. [...] The smell of the wet feathers in the heat! [...] You spoke of John's not being safe to stay with. [...] You don't know what a gentle lot we are: [...] We wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us [...] Moving a flock of hens from place to place. [...] We're not allowed to take them upside down, [...] All we can hold together by the legs. [...] Two at a time's the rule, one on each arm, [...] No matter how far and how many times [...] We have to go." [...] "You mean that's John's idea." [...] "And we live up to it; or I don't know [...] What childishness he wouldn't give way to. [...] He manages to keep the upper hand [...] On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens: [...] We fence our flowers in and the hens range. [...] Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays. [...] John likes to tell the offers he has had, [...] Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. [...] He never takes the money. If they're worth [...] That much to sell, they're worth as much to keep. [...] Bless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down [...] The little tin box on the cupboard shelf, [...] The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one. [...] I'll show you. Here you are." [...] "What's this?" [...] "A bill-- [...] For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock-- [...] Receipted. And the cock is in the yard." [...] "Not in a glass case, then?" [...] "He'd need a tall one: [...] He can eat off a barrel from the ground. [...] He's been in a glass case, as you may say, [...] The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported. [...] John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads-- [...] Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain. [...] But you see, don't you, we take care of him." [...] "And like it, too. It makes it all the worse." [...] "It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless [...] In ways that I can hardly tell you of. [...] Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts [...] To see where all the money goes so fast. [...] You know how men will be ridiculous. [...] But it's <b>just</b> <b>fun</b> the way he gets bedeviled-- [...] If he's untidy now, what will he be----? [...] "It makes it all the worse. You must be blind." [...] "Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me." [...] "Can't you and I get to the root of it? [...] What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?" [...] "It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all." [...] "But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours, [...] Being cut off from friends?" [...] "We have our friends. [...] That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us." [...] "She's let it worry her. You stood the strain, [...] And you're her mother." [...] "But I didn't always. [...] I didn't relish it along at first. [...] But I got wonted to it. And besides-- [...] John said I was too old to have grandchildren. [...] But what's the use of talking when it's done? [...] She won't come back--it's worse than that--she can't." [...] "Why do you speak like that? What do you know? [...] What do you mean?--she's done harm to herself?" [...] "I mean she's married--married someone else." [...] "Oho, oho!" [...] "You don't believe me." [...] "Yes, I do, [...] Only too well. I knew there must be something! [...] So that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!" [...] "Bad to get married when she had the chance?" [...] "Nonsense! See what's she done! But who, who----" [...] "Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess? [...] Say it right out--no matter for her mother. [...] The man was found. I'd better name no names. [...] John himself won't imagine who he is." [...] "Then it's all up. I think I'll get away. [...] You'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; [...] I suppose she deserves some pity, too. [...] You ought to have the kitchen to yourself [...] To break it to him. You may have the job." [...] "You needn't think you're going to get away. [...] John's almost here. I've had my eye on someone [...] Coming down Ryan's Hill. I thought 'twas him. [...] Here he is now. This box! Put it away. [...] And this bill." [...] "What's the hurry? He'll unhitch." [...] "No, he won't, either. He'll just drop the reins [...] And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all. [...] She won't get far before the wheels hang up [...] On something--there's no harm. See, there he is! [...] My, but he looks as if he must have heard!" [...] John threw the door wide but he didn't enter. [...] "How are you, neighbour? Just the man I'm after. [...] Isn't it Hell," [...] he said. [...] "I want to know. [...] Come out here if you want to hear me talk. [...] I'll talk to you, old woman, afterward. [...] I've got some news that maybe isn't news. [...] What are they trying to do to me, these two?" [...] "Do go along with him and stop his shouting." [...] She raised her voice against the closing door: [...] "Who wants to hear your news, you--dreadful fool?" ...|$|E
