In Veracruz, the highest precipitation reading associated with Gert was 117mm, (4.61in) in El Higo. However, damage overall was minimal, amounting to $6million (2005USD, $60million 2005 MXN), {{and there was}} only one reported fatality, from a man who was carried away by the La Silla River when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> a stalled car across the flooded stream.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, {{leaving an}} opening in the GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was being talked of as a possible candidate for a south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E

25|$|Gilray {{returned}} to practising law in Milton in 1919. However, in 1922 {{he was appointed}} principal of John McGlashan College in Dunedin, succeeding Arthur Gordon Butchers. During his tenure, Gilray developed music and science at the school, and raised academic standards. While visiting Queenstown in September 1931, Gilray sustained a fracture dislocation of his left ankle when it was run over by the car that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> {{in an attempt to}} make it start. He was left with one leg shorter than the other.|$|E
25|$|Dexter {{declared}} himself unavailable for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa as he contested Jim Callaghan's Cardiff South East seat for the Conservative Party in the 1964 General Election. Finding himself free to tour after his defeat {{he was made}} vice-captain to M.J.K. Smith, who won the series and continued as captain. His cricket career was virtually ended by an accident in 1965. His Jaguar car ran out of petrol in west London, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> it to safety when it pinned him to a warehouse door, breaking his leg. He left Sussex and played occasional Sunday games with the International Cavaliers, and made 104 when they defeated the 1966 West Indians by 7 wickets. He returned briefly in 1968, making 203 not out in his comeback match against Kent, but failing in the 1968 Ashes series. He played Sunday League games for Sussex in 1971 and 1972.|$|E

25|$|Boelcke was {{appointed}} commander of his hand-picked group of pilots on 30 August 1916. Three squadrons {{were the first}} ones founded, on 10 August 1916, but among them, Jagdstaffel 2 became the premier German unit. It ended the war with 20 aces among its members, a total of 336 victories, and a casualty list of only 44. In the beginning, however, Boelcke started with only the empty buildings vacated by FFA 32 in the Vélu Woods. As of 27 August, the fledgling jasta had three officers and 64 other ranks on strength, but no aircraft. But as of 8 September, there were eight pilots on board, including Manfred von Richthofen and Erwin Böhme. Three days later, Böhme noted <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> for permission to use his castoff Halberstadt, since Boelcke had a Fokker; {{there seemed to be}} four aircraft in the squadron by then. On 16 September, Boelcke's new squadron received five new Albatros D.Is for the pilots, and an improved Albatros D.II for the Staffelfuhrer. Boelcke promptly put the new fighters in the air on the first-ever fighter unit effort to gain local air superiority. At 1300 hours 16 September, Boelcke and five of his pilots took off; they intercepted a British bombing raid on Marcoing Railway Station. While Boelcke held aside, his five tyros bounced a British formation of 14 planes, broke it up, and shot down two. The master himself added another.|$|E

500|$|On July 19, 2012, Rapzilla posted {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "Is Lecrae and T.I. similar to Kanye vs 50 Cent?", which noted that [...] by T.I. {{was scheduled for}} release {{the same day as}} Gravity. The article speculated that the potential cultural impact of Gravity could be like that of Kanye West after his 2007 competition with 50 Cent. The writer, Steven Patton, stated that [...] "we may be on the cusp of another watershed moment this coming September. Two artists living in Atlanta and largely the front runners of two different ideologies are releasing a new album on the same day." [...] A few hours after being posted, the article was updated stating that the release date for Trouble Man was being pushed back to September 19. However, the release date was subsequently returned to September 4, before T.I. announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> the album back indefinitely. Trouble Man ultimately was released on December 18, 2012, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 179,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Moore {{writes in}} the e-book Metal Missionaries that during mid-1990s Christian metal [...] "ceased to play catch up (replicating secular bands) and began to {{assimilate}} into its rightful place in the Extreme music scene and the artists who played became influential in helping to define this relatively new, but growing genre." [...] With risen musical quality and more street-credibility, Christian metal and hardcore bands were signed to record labels such as Tooth and Nail, Solid State, Facedown Records as well as secular labels Metal Blade and Victory Records. Christian metal was available through non-Christian outlets; [...] "For the first time Extreme Christian music moved from the dusty back bin of the Christian book stores to the front racks at super retailers like Best Buy, Circuit City, FYE and even giant retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Hot Topic." [...] The German secular metal label Nuclear Blast Records also released Christian metal. Torodd Fuglesteg of Norway's Arctic Serenades Records has claimed: [...] "The owner of Nuclear Blast was a committed Christian and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> everything with that religious agenda through Nuclear Blast. Mortification and Horde were pushed like mad by Nuclear Blast when other labels were pushing pure satanic stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{start of}} the {{following}} season continued the same trend for O'Keefe as he made just eight appearances during {{the first five months}} of the season before returning to the starting line up against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 16 January 2016, in a match that Cardiff went on to win 3–1. O'Keefe's performances saw him establish himself in the first team and his attitude to being left out of the team for long periods drew praise from Cardiff manager Russell Slade who commented [...] "Stuart has got a fantastic attitude, he's a real, real good professional, even when he wasn't in the side <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing.</b> [...] some players when they're not in the side get disillusioned and want to move on, but not O'Keefe." [...] He later scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 victory during a Severnside derby match against Bristol City on 5 March 2016, adding his second one-month later with the winning goal during a 2–1 win over Derby County on 2 April. He finished the season having made 27 appearances for the club in all competitions, the most appearances he has made during a season to date and {{the first time in his}} career he made over 20 appearances in a single season.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{declined}} {{a number}} of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in 1862. For {{the duration of the}} job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. [...] By late 1864, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> again {{for an end to the}} war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: [...] "You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But when I look back upon the events of the winter, I find that I was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Farlow's patrol {{sent back}} a report which was {{received}} at 16:45 that the pass was unoccupied but that men {{could be seen}} withdrawing from Nekhl towards the east. Farlow requested support [...] "as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushing</b> on in pursuit" [...] and 'B' Squadron 11th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 17:10. Meanwhile, Farlow's patrol captured four enemy soldiers with ten camels but they were prevented from crossing the plain by rifle fire from about 50 defenders in the foothills where the Nekhl to Akaba road leaves the plain {{to the east of}} Nekhl. An aircraft which landed at Grant's advanced base shortly after 'B' Squadron left, was sent to reconnoitre Nekhl. It returned at 17:40 to report the town unoccupied and no sign of any enemy soldiers on the roads to the east. 'B' Squadron, commanded by Captain C. A. R. Munro entered Nekhl at 19:45 [...] "riding with fixed bayonets." [...] Two Bedouin and one Ottoman soldier were captured in the town. The 100 cavalry garrison at Nekhl, warned by Bedouin of the British advance, had withdrawn in the direction of Aqaba. They left behind a field gun and 11 prisoners. As it was dark further movement was impossible and the squadron bivouacked in the town with a defensive cordon while the plain was patrolled during the night. All three aircraft landed at Bir el Themada where they camped with Northern Column during a very cold night.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of several spirits or ghosts in the St. James Theatre. One of the most seen ghosts is that of Yuri, a Russian performer who supposedly fell to his death from the flies several metres above the stage. Another account, more widely accepted, says <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> by a female named Pasha, also a Russian performer. Yuri has been encountered playing with the lights, especially turning them all back on again once cleaners have left for the night. One projectionist says Yuri saved his life twice. While on stage, {{the lights went out}} in the auditorium. While searching for the light switch, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> backwards by what <b>he</b> believed <b>was</b> Yuri. The lights turned back on and the projectionist realised <b>he</b> <b>was</b> only inches from the orchestra pit and if <b>he</b> had not <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> back, would have fallen in. The second time he says Yuri saved him <b>was</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on stage with his infant son. He suddenly heard a beam collapse above him.
