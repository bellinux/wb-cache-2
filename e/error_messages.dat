5000|$|Although {{infinite}} loops in {{a single}} program are usually easy to predict, a loop caused by several entities interacting is much harder to foresee. Consider a server that always replies with an <b>error</b> <b>message</b> {{if it does not}} understand the request. Apparently, there is no possibility for an infinite loop in the server, but if there are two such servers (A and B), and A receives a message of unknown type from B, then A replies with an <b>error</b> <b>message</b> to B, B does not understand the <b>error</b> <b>message</b> and replies to A with its own <b>error</b> <b>message,</b> A does not understand the <b>error</b> <b>message</b> from B and sends yet another <b>error</b> <b>message,</b> and so on ad infinitum. One common example of such situation is an email loop.An example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the [...] "this is a no reply inbox" [...] response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the no-reply inbox, {{and so on and so}} forth.|$|R

On the release day, a poster was uploaded on Madonna's Instagram which confirmed that along with the aforementioned personnel, singer Beyoncé would also appear in it. Joe Lynch from Billboard compared the poster to those uploaded during the release of [...] "Bad Blood" [...] but nevertheless believed, [...] "it's likely that Madge had this project in the works before becoming aware of Taylor's plans". However, the video did not arrive on June 16, instead a second teaser was released, showing Madonna twerking in jeans shorts and high heels, with multi-colored graphics. It ultimately premiered the next day on Tidal, along with a behind-the-scenes clip. It was an exclusive release to the streaming site for the first 24 hours, following which it was released on Madonna's Vevo page. The full list of guest appearances in the video included Beyoncé, Perry, Cyrus, Minaj, Ora, and Diplo along with rapper Kanye West, actor and comedian Chris Rock, designer Alexander Wang, model Jon Kortajarena and Madonna's sons Rocco and David. However, the video faced problems in Tidal with <b>error</b> <b>messages</b> and freezing in-between, resulting in the company releasing an apology on Twitter: [...] "We apologize to all the fans excited to watch the #BitchImMadonna video, we’re working on a fix.
