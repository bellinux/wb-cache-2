To {{predict the}} <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curve</b> of a {{centrifugal}} pump impeller. Design/methodology/approach. This article compares {{the results obtained}} from a numerical experiment using the boundary-element method with previously reported results obtained from the calculation using Ansys CFX and {{with the results of}} physical experiments performed on the test-rig of JSC ?VNIIAEN?. To calculate the flow in the hydraulic passage we consider the model of nonviscous fluid. The flow is considered to be unseparated, vortex free, three-dimensional, steady. Based on the solution of the direct 3 D problem by the boundary-element method we calculated the periphery-averaged and height-averaged moment of the absolute velocity at impeller inlet and outlet. We used the Euler formula to calculate the value of the predicted head. Findings. The rated head of the impeller calculated by using the boundary-element method agrees well with the results of physic experiment and with the results obtained from the calculation using Ansys CFX. The behavior of the predicted <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curve</b> corresponds better to the results in the operating range and in the right side of it. Originality/value.

40|$|The yield (or discharge) of constant-speed pumps {{varies with}} the total dynamic head (or lift) against which the pump is discharging.

In groundwater simulations that are used for management evaluations or other purposes, where predictive accuracy depends on the reliability of future discharge estimates, model reliability may be enhanced by including the effects of head-capacity (or pump-capacity) relations on the discharge from the well. A relatively simple algorithm has been incorporated into the widely used MODFLOW groundwater flow model that allows a model user to specify <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curves.</b> The algorithm causes the model to automatically adjust the pumping rate each time step {{to account for the}} effect of drawdown in the cell and changing lift, and will shut the pump off if lift exceeds a critical value.

The prediction performance of the proposed method here is tested against four sets of measured total heads and efficiencies of mixed-flow pumps, and it is also compared with that based on two-dimensional cascade theory.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented for the computation of unsteady, three-dimensional potential flows in hydraulic pumps and turbines. The superelement method {{has been extended}} in order to eliminate slave degrees of freedom {{not only from the}} governing Laplace equation, but also from the Kutta conditions. The resulting superelement formulation is invariant under rotation. Therefore the geometrical symmetry of the flow channels in the rotor can be exploited. This makes the method especially suitable to performing fully coupled computations of the unsteady flow phenomena in both rotor and stator, the so-called rotor–stator interaction. The developed numerical method is used to simulate the unsteady flow in an industrial mixed-flow pump. Two types of simulation are considered: one in which unsteady wakes behind the trailing edges of the rotor blades are taken into account and one in which these are neglected. Results are given that show the importance of unsteady flow phenomena. However, the computed <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curve</b> is hardly influenced by whether or not unsteady wakes are taken into account. Copyright # 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|A {{performance}} prediction {{procedure is}} presented for low specific speed submersible pumps with {{a review of}} loss models given in the literature. Most of the loss theories discussed in this paper are one dimensional and improvements are made with good empiricism for the prediction to cover {{the entire range of}} operation of the low specific speed pumps. Loss correlations, particularly in the low flow range, are discussed. Prediction of the shape of efficiency-capacity and total <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curves</b> agrees well with the experimental results in almost the full range of operating conditions. The approach adopted in the present analysis, of estimating the losses in the individual components of a pump, provides means for improving the performance and identifying the problem areas in existing designs of the pumps. The investigation also provides a basis for selection of parameters for the optimal design of the pumps in which the maximum efficiency is an important design parameter. The scope for improvement in the prediction procedure with the nature of flow phenomena in the low flow region has been discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The pump {{design is}} {{facilitated}} {{by the development of}} computational fluid dynamics and the complex internal flows in water pump impellers can be well predicted. Various parameters affect the pump performance and energy consumption. The impeller outlet diameter, the blade angle and the blade number are the most critical. The present paper describes the simulation of the flow into the impeller of a laboratory pump in a parametric manner. In this study, the performance of impellers with the same outlet diameter having different outlet blade angles is thoroughly evaluated. The one-dimensional approach along with empirical equations is adopted for the design of each impeller. The predicted performance curves result through the calculation of the internal flow field and a successful correlation of local and global parameters. The numerical solution of the discretized three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over an unstructured grid is accomplished with a commercial CFD finite-volume code. For each impeller, the flow pattern and the pressure distribution in the blade passages are calculated and finally the <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curves</b> are compared and discussed...|$|R

An insight into the ageing effects on the pump performance was also provided. Furthermore, the dynamic pump behavior was investigated, with specific reference to the flow-rate ripple at the delivery port. A general analytical expression has been derived for the volumetric efficiency. Furthermore, a specific procedure has been developed and applied to the experimental evaluation of the fuel leakages in pressure control valve (PCV) integrated pumps. Finally, the mechanical-hydraulic efficiency of the pump has experimentally been assessed as a function of head and speed in order to obtain a reliable evaluation of the pump shaft power and torque at different working condition...|$|R
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Existing designs of centrifugal pumps can only handle very modest amounts of gas before they deprime. A normal centrifugal pump cannot usually handle any liquid having more than 7 - 9 percent gas content (by volume). Even this small percentage creates drop in head {{on the order of}} 20 percent as compared with 100 percent liquid. Furthermore the cavitation phenomenon considered {{is one of the most}} important problems in designing and operating a centrifugal pump. Especially when the uprating of pumps and driving at higher speeds to reduce size, its importance becomes greater. The physical mechanism of both two phase flow and cavitation remains to a great extend unexplained. In this investigation an attempt has been made to study these phenomena. A control volume method was employed to derive a mathematical model for a centrifugal pump under two phase flow conditions. The model combines the ideal (Eulers) two phase head of a centrifugal pump with additional losses due to compressibility and condensation of the gas phase. Systematic tests were carried out on a centrifugal pump of conventional design in order to established the causes of two phase head degradation and support the derived mathematical model. The excellence of the agreement obtained between the mathematical model and the experimental results gives confidence that it will be possible in the near future to predict the two phase <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curve</b> for any centrifugal pump. High speed video observations identified the basic mechanism leading to flow breakdown when pumping two phase mixtures and two phase flow and cavitation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between centrifugal impeller pumps {{with and without}} splitter blades in terms of suction performance is presented by experimental tests and numerical analyses. The design of both pumps {{was carried out by}} preserving the impeller meridional shape, number of blades, and volute casing. Blade shapes were obtained by adopting a 1 D inverse design method. The same blade loading distribution was assumed for the full blades of both impellers, while the loading distribution of the splitter blades was modified until a close matching between the two <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curves</b> was achieved. The fulfilment of this performance requirement {{and the use of the}} same number of blades were needed to describe accurately the role played by the splitter blades in cavitation inception and development. Differently from other experimental comparisons, where previous requirements were not met, a noticeable improvement in suction performance was found at large flow rates but not at partial ones, where a small deterioration in suction performance was observed. The crucial role played by the blade thickness blockage on the incidence flow angle at the leading edge of the full blades was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} {{prediction model}} generally applicable for volute-type centrifugal pumps {{has been extended}} to predict the dynamic characteristics of a pump during its normal starting and stopping periods. Experiments have been conducted on a volute pump with different valve openings to study the dynamic behaviour of the pump during normal start-up and stopping, when a small length of discharge pipeline {{is connected to the}} discharge flange of the pump. Such experiments have also been conducted when the test pump was part of a hydraulic system, an experimental rig, where it is pumping against three similar pumps, known as supply pumps, connected in series, with the supply pumps kept idle or running. Instantaneous rotational speed, flowrate, and delivery and suction pressures of the pump were recorded and it was observed in all the tested cases that the change of pump behaviour during the transient period was quasi-steady, which validates the quasi-steady approach presented in this paper. The nature of variation of parameters during the transients has been discussed.

40|$|Shortage of {{knowledge}} is still present {{in the literature on}} Common Rail (C. R.) about the high-pressure pump performance. Hydraulic-mechanical efficiency of the pump is only known as a mean value and no published data are available on the volumetric efficiency. Due to the fact that part of the pumped fuel can be partially expelled by the pressure-control valve (PCV) and {{because of the presence of}} the oil flowing in the cooling and lubrification circuit, the determination of the compression volumetric efficiency seems to be a hard task for PCV integrated pumps. In the present paper a detailed description of the C. R. high-pressure pumps performance has been provided. The dependence of the flow rate, sucked by the C. R. pump, on speed and load has been studied and the characteristic curve of the cooling-lubricant circuit has been determined. A theoretical expression of general application for the volumetric efficiency of reciprocating high-pressure pump has been derived. Furthermore a special procedure was designed and applied for the experimental evaluation of the fuel leakages in PCV integrated pumps.

40|$|Expansion of groundwater-fed {{irrigation}} has enhanced agricultural productivity, {{while simultaneously}} causing large reductions in groundwater storage. Hydro-economic modelling provides {{a valuable tool}} for evaluating trade-offs between agriculture and aquifer sustainability. However, a central argument in this thesis is that the reliability of integrated analysis of groundwater systems may {{be affected by the}} failure to consider adequately the variables influencing field-level irrigation decisions and the dynamic aquifer responses to those choices. This thesis addresses this limitation of existing research through three main contributions to the literature. In Chapter 2, a new model of farmers’ individual field-level groundwater-fed irrigation decision making is developed. Innovations include the explicit consideration of the role of soil moisture in intraseasonal irrigation scheduling, and evaluation of the impacts of weather variability and well yield on crop production. Application to a case study in the High Plains region of the United States demonstrates that low well yields limit significantly irrigated area and demand for groundwater. Furthermore, it is shown that this important behavioural response can not be captured by existing models that do not consider instantaneous supply constraints imposed by well yield. In Chapter 3, a combination of empirical analysis of observation data, and numerical simulations using the model developed in Chapter 2, are conducted to generate insights about the feedbacks between groundwater and agriculture. Reductions in well yield are shown to have large negative impacts on the productivity of irrigation whereas, contrary to previous assumptions, the response of irrigation behaviour to increased groundwater pumping lifts is found to be minimal. Importantly, this result highlights the need for integrated models to consider a broader range of factors influencing the sustainability of agricultural groundwater use. In Chapter 4, a novel hydro-economic modelling framework is presented that integrates the model of farmers’ individual irrigation decision making with a distributed multi-scale groundwater flow model. The model extends the scope of existing research by using pump <b>head-capacity</b> <b>curves</b> to quantify the effect of changing aquifer storage on well yields. Advantages of the modelling framework for policy analysis in coupled agricultural groundwater systems are demonstrated. Specifically, it is shown that the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture is influenced by intraseasonal and interannual changes in well yield that depend on famers’ pump choice and expectations about future dynamic aquifer responses. Moreover, the model demonstrates that managing the rate of well yield decline may have positive long-term impacts on both agricultural production and farmer welfare that have not been recognised in previous research.

40|$|One of {{the sources}} of {{instability}} in a centrifugal pump is cavitation within the pump. Cavitation of a centrifugal pump is the result of insufficient net positive suction head (NPSH) and can occur within the entire range of operating conditions. Cavitation may cause three different and undesirable effects: (1) a drop in <b>head-capacity</b> and efficiency <b>curves,</b> (2) damage to the impeller by pitting and erosion, and (3) structure vibration and resulting noise. Therefore, the cavitation process must be prevented by all means. To prevent the onset of cavitation we have to detect the beginning of the cavitation process in the pump. To detect the beginning of the cavitation process, the emitted noise can be used, among other possibilities. Specifically, a noise spectra structure can be used to detect the beginning of cavitation and its development. Experiments have shown that there is a discrete frequency tone, at 147 Hz, which is strongly dependent on the cavitation process and its development. Therefore, noise spectra {{can also be used to}} determine the NPSH required or the critical value, representing the upper limit of the permissible pump operation without cavitation...|$|R
40|$|It is an {{accepted}} fact that {{quite a number}} of problems faced in a pumping station are related to the design of sump or intake rather than pump design. <b>Head-capacity</b> <b>curves</b> provided by the pump manufacturer are obtained on the condition of no vortices flowing into the pump intake. The efficiency and performance of pumping stations depend not only on the performance of the selected pumps but also on the proper design of the intake sumps. A faulty design of pump sump can lead to the occurrence of swirl and vortices, which reduce the pump performance and induce vibration and additional noise. Therefore, sump model test is necessary to check the flow condition around intake structure. Numerical simulation is a good facility for reducing the time and cost involved throughout the design process. In this study, the commercial software ANSYS CFX- 13. 0 has been used for the CFD analysis of the sump models. In a scaled sump model for air entrainment simulation, numerical analysis of single phase and two-phase with SST turbulence model was carried out to predict vortex (both free surface vortex and submerged vortex) occurrence and location. The effectiveness of curtain walls and square bars to eliminate the free surface vortex is evaluated. Meanwhile, the experiment including PIV system was performed in KMOU to investigate the flow conditions around pump intake structure. In a full size sump model, overall numerical analysis for the sump model with a mixed flow pump installed was carried out. Hydraulic performances of the mixed flow pump for head rise, shaft power, pump efficiencies versus flow rate changed from 50 % to 140 % of the design flow rate were studied by the performance curves. A trident shaped anti vortex device (AVD) composed of three wall fillets and one center splitter was installed under the pump intake. The effectiveness of the AVD for the suppression of submerged vortex was evaluated. In addition, numerical simulation of cavitation phenomenon in the mixed flow pump has been performed by calculating the full cavitation model with k-琯 turbulence model. According to the results, details of the location, size and strength of vortices were predicted in the numerical simulation. For the scaled sump model, although there is a little difference between the single phase and two-phase simulation, all the results predict the free surface vortex and submerged vortex formation and location. The CFD simulations of flow condition show good agreement with the PIV results. The effectiveness of curtain walls installed to inhibit the free surface vortex is confirmed in the CFD resultswhile the square bars installed in the channel failed to suppress the free surface vortex. For the mixed flow pump with sump, the best efficiency point (BEP) is at the design flow rate with the corresponding efficiency of 89. 6 %. The effectiveness of AVDs installed for the submerged vortex is confirmed by comparisons of the sump model with and without AVD results. Cavitation phenomenon analysis shows the pump operating at the BEP condition has a considerable extent over the requirement of cavitation performance. With numerical simulation, the inception of cavitation in the blade passage is observed on the suction surface where the leading edges meet the tips, and then as the inlet total pressure decrease, the cavitation zone is spread out over the suction surface as well as {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blade.
