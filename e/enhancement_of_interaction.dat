This paper {{introduces}} a novel sonification-based interaction support for cooperating users in an Augmented Reality setting. When using head-mounted AR displays, {{the field of}} view is limited which causes users to miss important activities such as object interactions or deictic references of their interaction partner to (re-) establish joint attention. We introduce an interactive sonification which makes object manipulations of both interaction partners mutually transparent by sounds that convey information about the kind of activity, and can optionally even identify the object itself. In this paper we focus on the sonification method, interaction design and sound design, and we furthermore render the sonification both from sensor data (e. g. object tracking) and manual annotations. As a spin-off of our approach we propose this method further for the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> observation, data analysis, and multimodal annotation in interactional linguistics and conversation analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{excitation}} {{functions are}} presented for complete fusion and transfer reactions in {{the interaction of}} 6 He and 6, 7, 9 Li with different targets. In {{the case of the}} interaction of weakly bound nuclei the fusion process is more complex character due to the likely higher probability of the nuclei to breakup with subsequent capture of the residual nucleus (incomplete fusion). This greatly complicates the description of the interaction of such systems and leads to new unexpected effects at energies near the Coulomb barrier deeply subbarrier fusion and transfer of clusters from the weakly bound nuclei which are usually characterized by cluster structure. Reactions involving loosely bound nuclei and occurring at energies {{in the vicinity of the}} Coulomb barrier height have many special features that have vigorously been discussed in recent years in a number of studies (see, for example, [1, 2]). These features include the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> cross sections in the subbarrier energy region.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the current state and major imbalances in the financial market of Ukraine, which {{are the source of}} risk to the national economy and can significantly affect the monetary stability during the post-crisis period and the period of recession. Threats that are associated with peculiarities of the institutional structure of the financial market of Ukraine are analyzed, namely, on the one hand, the importance of banking institutions, and on the other – functional inadequacy of the banking systems in ensuring monetary and financial stability. The analysis shows that the weaknesses of the banking system have led to the accumulation of risks and structural misbalances in the Ukrainian economy which pose a danger to stability in the financial sector. Conclusions and measures are substantiated for the use of tools of monetary policy in order to strengthen monetary and financial stability. Among them are: the necessity of changes in the methodological tools of assessment of the financial stability and accumulation of systemic risk in the economy, measures to manage the inflation risk as the main internal risk for Ukraine, ways of <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> between the banking system and the national economy through the interest rate benchmark...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne {{pathogen}} that infects immunocompromised patients, {{enters and}} proliferates within mammalian cells by {{taking advantage of}} host cell machinery. While entry into macrophages and other phagocytic cells occurs constitutively, intracellular invasion of nonphagocytic cells, such as epithelial and endothelial cells, occurs through induced phagocytosis. Invasion of these nonphagocytic cell types is {{under the control of the}} secreted L. monocytogenes protein internalin B (InlB), which directly associates with and activates the receptor tyrosine kinase Met. Activation of Met by InlB has previously been shown to be potentiated by binding of glycosaminoglycans to the GW domains of this protein. We studied the interaction between heparin and full-length InlB as well as a truncated, functional form of InlB to understand the mode of interaction between these two molecules. InlB preferred long-chain (gdp 14) heparin oligosaccharides, and the interaction with heparin fit a complicated binding model with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. While there are various explanations for this complicated binding model, one supported by our data involves binding and rebinding of InlB to multiple binding sites on heparin in a positive and weakly cooperative manner. This mode is consistent with <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> of InlB with glycosaminoglycans for activation of Met. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne microbial pathoge...|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} to study transcription factors that regulate synthesis of IL- 2 mRNA because IL- 2 is primarily regulated at the transcription level. Two transcription factors that have a unique ability to synergistically activate IL- 2 transcription are NFATc 2 and cJun. The putative zinc finger on the C-terminal domain of NFATc 2 hinted us that zinc might affect the interaction between NFATc 2 and cJun homodimers. In this research, we studied the effect of zinc on the interaction between NFATc 2 and cJun homodimers. By using GST pull down assay, we found that zinc enhances the interaction between NFATc 2 and cJun homodimers. Zinc was unique in enhancing this interaction because other divalent metal ions such as calcium, manganese and magnesium did not enhance the interaction. In addition, preliminary results from DNA pull down assay showed that NFATc 2 might be recruiting cJun to the IL- 2 promoter. Moreover, FRET assay results showed {{that there could be}} a change in the conformation of NFATc 2 when zinc was present. This might be the reason behind the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> between NFATc 2 and cJun homodimers in the presence of zinc because zinc changes the conformation of NFATc 2, which might be the conformation that has higher interacting ability with cJun homodimers...|$|E

This study has two main purposes: (1) to investigate the impacts of selected firm-customer interaction behavior and demographic characteristics on customer retention behavior in the financial industry, (2) to compare {{the results of a}} static method of analysis (logistic regression model) and a dynamic method (Cox’s hazard method) for customer retention. ^ The statistical analyses conducted employing two cohorts showed that the Cox model was stable across cohorts. Using Cox’s hazard method, all of the independent variables were found to be significantly related to customer retention, while some of demographic factors (for example, tenure, marital status and gender, and channel usage) were not found to significantly affect customer retention in the logistic regression. ^ The results show that with the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> between a bank and its customers by increasing customers 2 ̆ 7 service usage, cross-buying, tenure experience, and complicated product usage, customers were more likely to stay longer with the bank. Additionally, age, education, and income were found to be positively related to customer retention, while customers with higher time pressure were less likely to defect. Single females were found to be least likely to attrite, while married customers were most likely to default or switch to an alternative. Single males were more likely to stay than married ones, but more likely to churn than single female customers.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{prion protein}} (PrPC) is a neuronal anchored glycoprotein {{that has been}} associated with distinct functions in the CNS, such as cellular adhesion and differentiation, synaptic plasticity and cognition. Here we investigated the putative involvement of the PrPC in the innate fear-induced behavioural reactions in wild-type (WT), PrPC knockout (Prnp(0 / 0)) and the PrPC overexpressing Tg- 20 mice evoked in a prey versus predator paradigm. The behavioural performance of these mouse strains in olfactory discrimination tasks was also investigated. When confronted with coral snakes, mice from both Prnp(0 / 0) and Tg- 20 strains presented a significant decrease in frequency and duration of defensive attention and risk assessment, compared to WT mice. Tg- 20 mice presented decreased frequency of escape responses, increased exploratory behaviour, and <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> with the snake, suggesting a robust fearlessness caused by PrPC overexpression. Interestingly, there was also a discrete decrease in the attentional defensive response (decreased frequency of defensive alertness) in Prnp(0 / 0) mice in the presence of coral snakes. Moreover, Tg- 20 mice presented an increased exploration of novel environment and odors. The present findings indicate that the PrPC overexpression causes hyperactivity, fearlessness, and increased preference for visual, tactile and olfactory stimuli-associated novelty, and that the PrPC deficiency might lead to attention deficits. These results suggest that PrPC exerts {{an important role in the}} modulation of innate fear and novelty-induced exploration. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} theoretically {{that the}} spectra of electromagnetic emission of surface systems can display remarkable {{differences in the}} near and the far zones. The spectral changes occur due {{to the loss of}} evanescent modes and are especially pronounced for systems which support surface waves. PACS numbers: 78. 20. – e, 05. 40. – a, 44. 40. + a, 87. 64. Xx Spectroscopy of electromagnetic radiation is perhaps the most powerful exploration tool employed in natural sciences: astronomy, atomic and molecular physics and chemistry, materials science, biology, etc. The central question considered in this paper—whether the spectral content of the radiation emitted by an object can change on propagation to the observer—usually does not arise, since it seems natural that nothing can happen to waves travel-ing through empty space. Surprisingly similar failure of common sense was put forward by the recent progress of near-field optical microscopy [1, 2], which achieves sub-wavelength resolution exactly because evanescent modes carrying subwavelength spatial information do not propagate far away from the object. However, a great deal of work devoted to such an irreversible change of spatial information on propagation has been accompanied with significantly lesser interest in the possibility of the change of spectral information. The subject of spectral changes on propagation has, however, been addressed. In the 1980 's, Wolf [3] predicted that the spectrum of light can be changed on propagation from the source to the observer, even through empty space. This effect, whose origin lies in the fluctuating nature of the source, has been intensively studied in a variety of systems [4, 5]. Typically, the Wolf effect is manifested in small spectral shifts and {{can be viewed as a}} redistribution of the weights of different spectral components. In this Letter, we demonstrate spectral changes, whose physical origin is very different from that of Wolf spectral shifts and lies in the presence of the evanescent component in the emitted field. We show that the near-field and far-field spectra of emitted electric fields can display drastic differences. For a broadband emission, such as thermal emission which is considered in detail in this paper, the near-field spectrum dominated by evanescent modes can be entirely different from the far-field spectrum of propagating modes. These spectral changes occur not due to the statistical nature of the source (as in the Wolf effect) but due to the loss of evanescent components on propagation. We analyze how such spectral changes can be enhanced by electromagnetic surface waves (SW) near the interface. These SW are known to play an important role in the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> between nanoparticles near the surface [6], in localization effects on random surfaces [7], in surface-enhanced Raman scattering [8], in extraordinary transmission of light through subwavelength holes [9], etc. In this Letter, we show that SW provide the leading contribution to the density of energy in the near-field zone of electromagnetic emission. We now proceed with analyzing near-field effects in the spectra of thermal emission, which provides an easy way to excite both propagating and evanescent electromagnetic modes in a wide range of frequencies (at least, in the infrared [10 – 12]). Thermal emission is frequently associated with the textbook example of equilibrium black-body radiation. The Planck spectrum I BB v of such radiation is obtained by multiplying the thermal energy uv, T ¯ hvexp ¯ hvk B T 2 1 of a quantum oscil-lator by the density of oscillations (modes) per unit volume Nvdv v 2 dvp 2 c 3 in the frequency interval v, v 1 dv, and dividing the result by dv [13], I BB v uv, T Nv ¯ h p 2 c 3 v 3 exp ¯ hvk B T 2 1. (1) Here T is the body temperature, k B is Boltzmann's constants, ¯ h is Planck's constant divided by 2 p, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. A well-known representation of blackbody radiation is the equilibrium radiation in a closed cavity with lossy walls when only propagating modes of the field are taken into account. To demonstrate the importance of near-field effects, we consider a somewhat more sophisticated example of thermal emission from a semi-infinite z, 0 slab of homogeneous, nonmagnetic material held in local thermodynamic equilibrium at a uniform temperature T, into the empty half-space z. 0.

40|$|Malaria control {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} insecticides, {{especially}} the pyrethroids, for control interventions such as Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spraying (ITNs). However, widespread resistance to insecticides in major malaria vectors, such as An. funestus is threatening to derail these control tools. To design and implement suitable resistance management strategies which will ensure the continued effectiveness of these control tools it is necessary to elucidate the molecular basis of the resistance. In An. funestus, resistance is mainly metabolic with the duplicated P 450 s CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b implicated as the major pyrethroid resistance genes. Despite the detection of these key resistance genes the detailed molecular mechanisms through which they confer pyrethroid resistance remain uncharacterised. Because CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b were shown to exhibit significant allelic variation between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes, we hypothesised that this allelic variation is potentially a key mechanism conferring pyrethroid resistance. Here, I characterised the role of these genes in the resistance to pyrethroids and identified other candidate genes which confer cross-resistance to non-pyrethroid insecticides. The role of allelic variation in pyrethroid resistance was investigated using polymorphism survery and in silico prediction of activity. Metabolic activities and efficiencies of allelic variants of CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b were investigated using fluorescent probes, metabolism assays and transgenic expression in D. melanogaster system. Pyrethroid resistance causative mutations were detected using the site-directed mutagenesis. Other candidate P 450 s that confer cross-resistance to pyrethroids carbamates and organochlorines were identified and characterised. This study revealed that CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b from resistant populations of An. funestus are undergoing directional selection with reduced genetic diversity and beneficial mutations selected, compared to the alleles from susceptible strain (FANG), which exhibited high genetic variation. Modelling and docking simulations predicted the alleles of CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b from the resistant strains all across Africa to metabolise pyrethroids with high efficiency while the susceptible alleles FANGCYP 6 P 9 a and FANGCYP 6 P 9 b were predicted to have low activity toward pyrethroids. Validation of the docking predictions with probes and metabolism assays established that the resistant alleles of CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b possess high activities toward pyrethroids with kinetic profiles significantly different (high affinity and catalytic efficiency) from those obtained from the FANG, indicating that allelic variation is playing a major role in pyrethroid resistance. These findings were further strengthened by results from transgenic expression with GAL 4 /UAS technology showing that flies expressing the resistant alleles of both genes were significantly more resistant to pyrethroids than those expressing the susceptible alleles. Using mutagenesis, three key residues (Val 109, Asp 335 and Asn 384) from the resistant allele of CYP 6 P 9 b were established as the important amino acid changes responsible for resistance with impact on substrate channelling, possible <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> with redox partners and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions, respectively conferring high metabolic efficiency. The finding of these resistance markers make it possible to design a diagnostic tool that can allow detection and tracking of the resistant alleles in the field population of An. funestus across Africa. Other up-regulated P 450 s in multiple resistant populations from southern Africa were also characterised, revealing that pyrethroid resistance is mediated by other P 450 s as well: CYP 6 M 7, CYP 6 Z 1, CYP 9 J 11 and CYP 6 AA 4 all of which metabolise pyrethroids. CYP 6 Z 1 and CYP 9 J 11 are cross-resistance genes which metabolise bendiocarb, while CYP 6 Z 1 metabolise DDT in addition. In conclusion, allelic variation is a key mechanism conferring pyrethroid resistance in An. funestus s. s. from sub-Saharan Africa. Key amino acid changes control pyrethroid resistance factors and these molecular markers can be used to design DNA-based diagnostic tests which will allow tracking of the resistance alleles in the field. Pyrethroid resistance is multi-genic in the field populations of An. funestus with other P 450 s involved apart from CYP 6 P 9 a and CYP 6 P 9 b. The finding of cross-resistance P 450 s is of concern to resistance management and should be taken into account when designing resistance management strategies...|$|E

Magnetization data reveals the continuous tailoring of magnetic transition due to weakening of Ho 3 +-Fe 3 + and Fe 3 +-Fe 3 + interactions in the entire temperature range by replacing the Fe 3 + ions with Cr 3 + ions. The observed decrease in Néel temperature (TN) and increase in spin re-orientation transition temperature (TSR) with the replacement of Fe 3 + with Cr 3 + is ascribed to the weakening of Fe(Cr) -O-Fe(Cr) antiferromagnetic exchange interaction.

Post-print sourced from www. arxiv. org. We compute the quark–gluon vertex in quenched lattice QCD in the Landau gauge, using an off-shell mean-field O(a) -improved fermion action. The Dirac-vector part of the vertex is computed for arbitrary kinematics. We find a substantial infrared <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interaction</b> strength regardless <b>of</b> the kinematics. Ayse Kizilersu, Derek B. Leinweber, Jon-Ivar Skullerud and Anthony G.

The experimental {{results indicate that}} the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> the electron-phonon <b>interaction</b> with soft "cluster modes" is the origin of the tenfold increase of T-c in these compounds.

40|$|The {{abnormal}} IR effects(AIREs) of the adsorption of CO on electrodes made of Pt nanostructured {{thin films}} generated in square wave potential treatment were observed. Based on the experimental results, the AIREs were analysed and simulated by {{taking into consideration}} <b>of</b> the interparticle <b>interaction</b> and the electron - hole damping. The results illustrate that the islanded narrostructured Pt surfaces give rise to the interactions between CO molecules {{as well as between}} CO molecules and nanostructured Pt surface. The energy transfer due to electron-hole damping and the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> interparticle <b>interaction</b> are the important cause of the changes of IR absorption spectra...|$|R

However, mid-infrared plasmonic resonances in graphene nanostructures are usually weak and narrow-banded, limiting their potential in light manipulation and detection. Here we investigate the coupling among graphene plasmonic nanostructures and further show that by engineering the coupling, <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> light-graphene <b>interaction</b> strength and broadening of spectral width can be achieved simultaneously. Leveraging the concept of coupling, we demonstrate a hybrid 2 -layer graphene nanoribbon array which shows 5 to 7...|$|R
