50|$|A Swiss-style lathe is a {{specific}} design of lathe providing extreme accuracy (sometimes holding tolerances {{as small as a}} few tenths of a thousandth of an inch - a few micrometers). A Swiss-style lathe holds the workpiece with both a collet and a <b>guide</b> <b>bushing.</b> The collet sits behind the <b>guide</b> <b>bushing,</b> and the tools sit in front of the <b>guide</b> <b>bushing,</b> holding stationary on the Z axis. To cut lengthwise along the part, the tools will move in and the material itself will move back and forth along the Z axis. This allows all the work to be done on the material near the <b>guide</b> <b>bushing</b> where it is more rigid, making them ideal for working on slender workpieces as the part is held firmly with little chance of deflection or vibration occurring. This style of lathe is commonly used under CNC control.|$|E

50|$|Most CNC Swiss-style lathes today use one or {{two main}} {{spindles}} plus {{one or two}} back spindles (secondary spindles). The main spindle is used with the <b>guide</b> <b>bushing</b> for the main machining operations. The secondary spindle is located behind the part, aligned on the Z axis. In simple operation it picks up the part as it is cut off, and accepts it for second operations, then ejects it into a bin, eliminating {{the need to have}} an operator manually change each part, {{as is often the case}} with standard CNC turning centers. This makes them very efficient, as these machines are capable of fast cycle times, producing simple parts in one cycle (i.e., no need for a second machine to finish the part with second operations), in as little as 10-15 seconds. This makes them ideal for large production runs of small-diameter parts.|$|E
40|$|Self-piloting tools {{feature the}} unique use of two support pads and the {{surrounding}} hole as a <b>guide</b> <b>bushing</b> to steer itself along the hole being machined. The piloting hole, {{in conjunction with the}} two support pads, provides for the tool balance in the hole transverse cross-section. However, in the axial section plane, the tool alignment with the piloting hole depends on the boring bar to which the tool appears as a solid extension. This study shows that the alterations in the output quality and the support pads' wear pattern can be explained by in-process encountered boring bar bending. This is because even minor inclinations near the tool tip appear significant when considered in the small front-end area of the support pads where burnishing occurs. The study is to explain the inherent feature of the conventional self-piloting tool design to deflect the boring bar in 3 D enough to make a difference between the effective area involved in burnishing and the area as designed...|$|E

40|$|Study {{of surface}} quality and {{machining}} accuracy {{of a deep}} hole in the camshaft in manufacturing environment is conducted to make recommendations to eliminate emerging stress concentrators on the hole surface after machining and arising cracks while the engine is in operation. So {{it is important to}} conduct a comprehensive task-driven study to determine qualitative and quantitative values of arithmetical mean deviation of the surface roughness profile (parameter of height) and available stress concentrators, as well as to define regularities of changing accuracy parameters for deep-hole length such as deviation size, radial run-out, and geometric tolerance in cross section. A guide diameter of the drill bushing and an outer diameter of the cutting part of one-sided cut have been determined too. A camshaft casting from ductile iron HF 65 - 48 - 1 was processed in the automatic line on the machine "Hȕller" by a drill with the cutting head from the hard alloy VK 6 with simultaneously rotating workpiece and tool. The drill was guided through drill bushing from solid alloy VK 15. The measurement results showed that in 53 % of samples there were tears and scratches up to 0. 15 mm in depth, which could serve as stress concentrators and in the process of operation encourage growth of cracks in the bulk of the camshaft material. A significantly increasing value of the radial run-out size and all six studied harmonic components show that there is a deviation of the hole axis (run) from the nominal (specified) position and faceting available with their copied (increased) values along {{the entire length of the}} hole. This is a qualitative confirmation that in processing the holes in parts made from grey cast iron, there is a mechanism of copying errors earlier available. It is found that the size of a clearance between guide diameter of drill bushing and diameter of tool gage ribbon makes 0. 150 mm and almost 3 times exceeds the recommended value. All this reduces resistance, promotes a wear of the guide elements and a gauge part of the tool. In turn, these reasons create favorable conditions for built-up edge on calibrating and cutting parts of the one-sided cuts which contribute to tears and scratches on the surface of the camshaft hole. Thus, the causes and the mechanism of appearing stress concentrators and their possible growth in the bulk of the material during camshaft operation have been defined. As the wear mechanisms of <b>guide</b> <b>bushing</b> of various drill bits are different, it is advised to settle no more than 80 processing cycles for bushing and at most 63 cycles for drills. The technological operation content on deep drilling to be made has to contain a mandatory checking of the diametral clearance between the drill bushing hole and the calibrating part of the drill, which must be of 0. 055 mm at most. It is recommended to introduce a drill size m= 0. 26 0. 39 mm in its working drawing because it is unavailable there. It allows to reduce deviation of drill cutting part from the nominal position, tool vibration, run of axis and faceting the camshaft holes. The elaborated recommendations can be used in the development of similar drilling operations. </p...|$|E
