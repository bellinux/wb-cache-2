50|$|Here is some {{history as}} {{referenced}} {{in the forward}} of ASME B18.29.1. <b>Helical</b> coil screw <b>thread</b> <b>inserts</b> have been in use for many years. It was first invented in the 1930s and found initial acceptance in aircraft manufactured and serviced by the Allied Air Forces during World War II. Since that time, applications for helical coil inserts have come into broad usage in aerospace, automotive and industrial equipment. Usage originally included metric spark plus sizes that were delineated in Europe in the 1950s coming into inch using countries in the 1960s. ASME Subcommittee 29 of the B18 Committee put together {{the first version of}} a standard in 1993. In 2010, ANSI approved of recent revisions and ASME published a revision of B18.29.1 - <b>Helical</b> Coil Screw <b>Thread</b> <b>Inserts</b> - Free Running and Screw Locking (Inch Series).|$|R
50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>inserts</b> come in many varieties, {{depending}} on the application. <b>Threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> for plastics are used in plastic materials and applied with thermal insertion or ultrasonic welding machines.|$|R
40|$|The method {{concerns}} {{production of}} a <b>thread</b> <b>insert</b> (5) with an internal (7) in a component (1) provided with an internal thread (2) or a similar feature. The method is characterised by the following facts: a) a core (3) is inserted into the internal thread (2) of the component (1); b) a space (4) corresponding to the <b>thread</b> <b>insert</b> (5) is formed between the core (3) and the tread (2); c) the space (4) is filled by a casting process. USE - In joints subjected to severe mechanical and thermal loading, temperature fluctuations, vibrations, impacts etc. ADVANTAGE - <b>Thread</b> <b>inserts</b> are produced in a more cost-effective manner...|$|R

40|$|Coil-spring {{screw-thread}} inserts found {{useful as}} temporary flow restrictors. Inserts placed in holes through which flow restricted, effectively reducing cross sections available for flow. Friction alone holds inserts against moderate upstream pressures. Use of coil-spring <b>thread</b> <b>inserts</b> as flow restrictors conceived as inexpensive solution to problem of adjusting flow of oxygen through orifices in faceplate into hydrogen/oxygen combustion chamber. Installation and removal of <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> gentle {{enough not to}} deform orifice tubes...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} types are the screw, nut and bolt. Other, more {{specialized}} types, include captive threaded fasteners, stud, <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts,</b> and <b>threaded</b> rods.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> to ensure a good retention.|$|R
50|$|People who use {{sheet metal}} or {{sandwich}} panel or honeycomb sandwich-structured composite often install <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> to spread shear, tension, and torque loads over a larger {{area of the}} material.|$|R

50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding <b>helical</b> <b>threads.</b> The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R
50|$|A swage nut or self-clinching nut {{is a type}} of nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> is used {{on sheet}} metal. A PEM® nut is a popular brand name by Penn Engineering & Manufacturing Corp, which is often used generically for swage nuts from any manufacturer.|$|R

5000|$|Pitch {{is defined}} as the axial {{distance}} between adjacent threads on a helix or screw. In most screws, called [...] "single start" [...] screws, which have a single <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> along their length, the lead and pitch are equal. They only differ in [...] "multiple start" [...] screws, which have several intertwined threads. In these screws, the lead is equal to the pitch multiplied by the number of [...] "starts".|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{mounting}} holes were tapped {{with a particular}} screw thread. When rack rails {{are too thin to}} tap, rivnuts or other <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> can be used, and when the particular class of equipment to be mounted is known in advance, some of the holes can be omitted from {{the mounting}} rails.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>inserts,</b> steel plates, and coolant pipes can be cast-in {{during the}} casting process. To achieve {{an even higher}} degree of versatility, linear rails, ground slide-ways and motor mounts can be {{replicated}} or grouted-in, therefore {{eliminating the need for}} any post-cast machining. The surface finish of the casting is as good as the mould surface.|$|R
5000|$|In most screws, called [...] "single start" [...] screws, {{which have}} a single <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> wrapped around them, the lead and pitch are equal. They only differ in [...] "multiple start" [...] screws, which have several {{intertwined}} threads. In these screws the lead {{is equal to the}} pitch multiplied by the number of starts. Multiple-start screws are used when a large linear motion for a given rotation is desired, for example in screw caps on bottles, and ball point pens.|$|R
50|$|Lug-style valves have <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> at {{both sides}} of the valve body. This allows them to be {{installed}} into a system using two sets of bolts and no nuts. The valve is installed between two flanges using a separate set of bolts for each flange. This setup permits either side of the piping system to be disconnected without disturbing the other side.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} of the dispersion characteristics of a C-band helix structure were carried out and compared to the dispersion characteristics found from a helix model using the three-dimensional electromagnetic computer code MAFIA. A conceptually novel design comprising a <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> of the same pitch and inner diameter in a cylindrical waveguide also were calculated using the MAFIA code. The helical-groove structure exhibits a smaller bandwidth but {{at a much higher}} frequency range than the traditional helical structure for similar physical dimensions. It is physically more robust in construction. The interaction impedance also compares favorably with those of the conventional structure...|$|R
50|$|Until {{recent years}} {{focusing}} {{of a camera}} lens to achieve a sharp image on the film plane was achieved {{by means of a}} very shallow <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the film plane. This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as polarising filters were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.|$|R
50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert,</b> is a {{one-piece}} internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|R
50|$|A <b>{{threaded}}</b> <b>insert,</b> {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|In most Forth systems, {{the body}} of a code {{definition}} consists of either machine language, or some form of threaded code. The original Forth which follows the informal FIG standard (Forth Interest Group), is a TIL (Threaded Interpretive Language). This is also called indirect-threaded code, but direct-threaded and subroutine threaded Forths have also become popular in modern times. The fastest modern Forths use subroutine <b>threading,</b> <b>insert</b> simple words as macros, and perform peephole optimization or other optimizing strategies to make the code smaller and faster.|$|R
50|$|Most SR {{connectors}} are {{variants of}} SR-50 (50 Ω) or SR-75 (75 Ω) versions, with the SR-75 typically having a thinner center pin. They often resemble C connectors in shape, and have <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> similar to N connectors. Further numerical suffixes denote specific kinds of connectors, for instance the CP 75-164 {{is a much}} larger high power connector, designed for upwards of 3000W, with a similar appearance to an N or UHF type. The various letters after the number refer to the dielectric material used.|$|R
5000|$|Radius at base of hole in boss: Bosses find use in many part designs as {{points for}} {{attachment}} and assembly. The most common variety consists of cylindrical projections with holes designed to receive screws, <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts,</b> or {{other types of}} fastening hardware. Providing a radius on the core pin helps in avoiding a sharp corner. This not only helps molding but also reduces stress concentration. It is recommended that the radius at base of hole in boss should be 0.25 to 0.5 times the nominal wall thickness.|$|R
