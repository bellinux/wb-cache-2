2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory brick lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, <b>inspection</b> <b>equipment</b> gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it. Operators carry out a range of checks manually on samples of containers, usually visual and dimensional checks.|$|E

40|$|In china, {{atmospheric}} {{storage tanks}} {{are not included}} in the management of special equipment, and therefore they are not required to be inspected compulsorily. There is larger difference between China and developed countries on atmospheric storage tank inspection technique than the other techniques on the inspection of pressure vessels. It is widely believed that the strength worsening and perforation of the tank is mainly caused by the serious corrosion at the bottom surface of tank floor. The present development of nondestructive testing on atmospheric storage tank was analyzed systematically in this paper, in which the principle, present status, the usage of <b>inspection</b> <b>equipments</b> and the application of the magnetic flux leakage testing and acoustic emission testing techniques on atmospheric storage tanks were mainly introduced. The problems existing in the <b>inspection</b> <b>equipments</b> usage were discussed.
