25|$|According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore always seemed to <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley was very strong, despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the square cut and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets.|$|E

500|$|Stage 12 {{started in}} Escaldes-Engordany, on the {{outskirts}} of Andorra la Vella, but the riders immediately left Andorra to return to Spain {{for the remainder of the}} Vuelta. The stage was much flatter than the previous day: there was just one categorised climb on the route. This was the second-category Coll de Bóixols ( [...] at 5%). The summit came after [...] of racing, with [...] to the finish line. The remainder of the stage was mostly flat, and the finish was relatively uncomplicated: there were [...] of straight roads leading into Lleida, with only two roundabouts. The stage was expected to suit the sprinters, as their teams would <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> after the climb to catch a breakaway.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

[...] Barbara Comstock, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said the congressman was unaware of any conversations like those Wilkes described having with Lowery.|$|E

2500|$|Sheehan is {{best remembered}} as a novelist; in his novel My New Curate, he recounts an {{incident}} of a clerical appointment {{that may well be}} autobiographical and refer to his arrival in Doneraile: [...] "The Bishop sent for me and said, with what I would call a tone of pity or contempt, but he was incapable of either, for he was the essence of charity and sincerity: 'Father Dan, you are a bit of a literateur, I understand. Kilronan is vacant. You'll <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for poetising and dreaming there. [...] What do you say to it?' I put on a little dignity, and though my heart was beating with delight, I quietly thanked his Lordship. [...] But, when I had passed beyond the reach of episcopal vision, which is far stretching enough, I spun my hat in the air, and shouted like a schoolboy: 'Hurrah!'".|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to think of better words".|$|E
