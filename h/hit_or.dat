5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> miss.|$|E
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a young hero who, {{together}} with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.|$|E

5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts {{to put out a}}n unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single <b>hit,</b> <b>or</b> the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E

5|$|Players on {{the batting}} team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out {{in any of}} several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to {{subsequent}} bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and {{the team with the}} greater number of runs {{at the end of the}} game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The North Weald pair, No. 504 and 257 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Dorniers with 20 Hurricanes. One German pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe {{developed}} engine trouble and lagged {{half a mile}} behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out of bullets, rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station. During its spinning dive, the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released, which <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> landed near to Buckingham Palace nearby, damaging the building. Zehbe bailed out and landed near The Oval and was severely wounded by a civilian mob. He was rescued by the British Army but died of his wounds. Holmes' Hurricane was badly damaged, crashing near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Holmes bailed out injured but survived.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{alternative}} rock remained mainly {{an underground}} phenomenon. While on occasion a song {{would become a}} commercial <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In {{the case of the}} United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes {{in various parts of the}} country. Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success. By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and The Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.|$|E

5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
