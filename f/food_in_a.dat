5|$|During the night, Kripik {{pulls his}} hand {{free of the}} single manacle used to chain him down, but mangles his hand while doing so. Kripik flees the post with his team of sled dogs, heading for his family's old village. Hunt and Balk pursue him. The rifle Kripik steals proves useless when the bullets are not the right gauge. Kripik is forced to kill his sled dogs one by one for <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> driving blizzard, Kripik falls short of {{reaching}} his family, and is attacked and injured by a wolf (which he manages to kill). Kripik is found by his eldest son Orsodikok (now a teenager), rescued, and fed by his family.|$|E

As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E
5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, {{but did not}} fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir frying, archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency to slice food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used for cooking. It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized as primary cooking method of Chinese cuisine. Stir frying was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough <b>food</b> (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} restaurants, which serve {{a wide array}} of Indian and {{international}} cuisines. Most of the food outlets serve only vegetarian food, as a strong tradition of vegetarianism is maintained by the city's Jain and Hindu communities. The first all-vegetarian Pizza Hut in the world opened in Ahmedabad. KFC has a separate staff uniform for serving vegetarian items and prepares vegetarian <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate kitchen, as does McDonald's. Ahmedabad has a quite a few restaurants serving typical Mughlai non-vegetarian food in older areas like Bhatiyar Gali, Kalupur and Jamalpur.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the common}} law {{protected}} habitation and sources of wealth and <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> largely agricultural society, the Industrial Revolution, especially the Luddism resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine-breaking – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721. Initially the punishment was transportation to the Colonies {{but as a result}} of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame-Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to burn <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solar cooker. Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food.

25|$|A churrascaria is a {{place where}} meat is cooked in churrasco style, which {{translates}} roughly from the Portuguese for 'barbecue'.

25|$|One {{positive}} {{effect of the}} program which is not immediately apparent {{is that it makes}} {{a significant impact on the}} ability of the poorest families to eat. Children in public schools receive one free meal a day—two in the poorest areas—and so less of their family's limited income is needed to pay for <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> survey of Bolsa Familia recipients, 82.4% reported eating better; additionally, it was reported to increase the incomes of the poorer families by about 25%.|$|E

25|$|Dieting is the {{practice}} of eating <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight. In other words, it is conscious control or restriction of the diet. A restricted diet is often used {{by those who are}} overweight or obese, sometimes in combination with physical exercise, to reduce body weight. Some people follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle). Diets {{can also be used to}} maintain a stable body weight and improve health. In particular, diets can be designed to prevent or treat diabetes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to expert systems, other researchers developed {{the concept of}} frame based languages in the mid 1980s. A frame is similar to an object class: It is an abstract description of a category describing things in the world, problems, and potential solutions. Frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction, e.g. understanding natural language and the social settings in which various default expectations such as ordering <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations.|$|E
