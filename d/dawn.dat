5|$|Wilson {{started a}} {{controversial}} feud with <b>Dawn</b> Marie in September 2002, in which <b>Dawn</b> would start {{a relationship with}} Wilson's real-life father Al Wilson. On the October 17 episode of Smackdown!, Torrie teamed up with Rikishi in losing effort to the team of <b>Dawn</b> Marie and Matt Hardy In response, Wilson defeated <b>Dawn</b> at No Mercy in October. Soon afterwards, <b>Dawn</b> would get engaged to Al, and told Wilson that she would break it off if she spent a night {{in a hotel room}} with her, though <b>Dawn</b> would later reveal this was a lie. <b>Dawn</b> would eventually show footage of this at Armageddon. The feud continued into the 2003 when <b>Dawn</b> and Al got married on the January 2 episode of SmackDown! in their underwear. One week later, Al then, in storyline, died from a heart attack after having rigorous sex numerous times in succession on their honeymoon. Wilson would defeat <b>Dawn</b> again at the Royal Rumble in what was billed as a Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match. The feud lasted four months.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Dawning</b> 6000 supercomputer, {{which has}} a {{projected}} performance of over 1 PFLOPS, will use the Loongson processor. The <b>Dawning</b> 6000 is currently being jointly developed by the ICT and <b>Dawning</b> Information Industry Company. Li Guojie, chairman of <b>Dawning</b> Information Industry Company and director and academician of the ICT, said {{research and development of}} the <b>Dawning</b> 6000 is expected to be completed in two years. By then, Chinese-made high-performance computers will be expected to achieve two major breakthroughs: first, the adoption of domestically made processors; second, the existing cluster-based system structure of high-performance computers will be changed once performance reaches 1 PFLOPS.|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{omni-directional}} antennas, directional antennas {{have many}} merits, such as lower interference, better spatial reuse, longer transmission range and the improved network capacity. Directional antennas enable numerous emerging outdoor and indoor applications, {{which have been}} addressed in many recent studies. Despite the advances in wireless networks with directional antennas (<b>DAWNs),</b> there are many research challenges in all layers of <b>DAWNs.</b> This paper presents a detailed study on recent advances and open research issues on <b>DAWNs.</b> Firstly, we briefly introduce the classification of directional antennas, antenna radiation patterns, antenna modes {{as well as the}} challenges in the physical layer of <b>DAWNs.</b> Then, we present research issues on the MAC layer, followed by the current solutions as well as open research problems. We also discuss the research issues on the routing layer, the transport layer and the performance evaluation of <b>DAWNs.</b> A brief introduction of indoor <b>DAWNs</b> is given in this paper as well.

5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. <b>Dawn</b> goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing <b>Dawn</b> has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, <b>Dawn</b> asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E

5|$|Knightly <b>Dawn</b> {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly <b>Dawn,</b> William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly <b>Dawn,</b> said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly <b>Dawn</b> was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E
