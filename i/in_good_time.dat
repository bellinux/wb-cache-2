40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the cyclical behaviour {{of fiscal}} policy in euro-area countries over the 1980 - 2005 period, {{focusing on the}} distinct role of government revenue and expenditure. The estimation of separate fiscal policy reaction functions <b>in</b> <b>good</b> and bad <b>times</b> reveals that, controlling for other factors, the average stance of fiscal policy is expansionary when output is above potential, thus denoting a pro-cyclical bias <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times,</b> while no strong evidence of a cyclical bias is found in bad times. The separate estimation of reaction functions for revenue and expenditure policy indicates that this pro-cyclical bias is an entirely expenditure-driven phenomenon. Probit regressions also reveal {{that the risk of}} pro-cyclicality <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> stems from expenditure behaviour, since expenditure-based budgetary adjustment is a highly significant determinant of the probability of pro-cyclical fiscal policy <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times.</b> The separate estimation of fiscal reaction functions in EU countries with strong and weak expenditure rules provide some support to the view that expenditure rules can be helpful to curb the expansionary bias of expenditure policy <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times.</b> Fiscal stabilisation, government revenue, government expenditure, fiscal rules, Turrini...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the consumption-investment {{problem of}} a loss averse investor equipped with s-shaped utility over consumption relative to a time-varying reference level. Optimal consumption exceeds the reference level <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> and descend to the subsistence level in bad times. Accordingly, the optimal portfolio is dominated by a mean-variance component <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> and rebalanced more aggressively toward stocks in bad times. This consumption-investment strategy contrasts with customary portfolio theory and is consistent with several recent stylized facts about investors' behaviour. I also analyse the joint effect of loss aversion and persistence of the reference level on optimal choices. Finally, the strategy of the loss averse investor outperforms the conventional Merton-style strategies in bad times, but tend {{to be dominated by}} the conventional strategies <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open {{that should have been}} shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 104 countries, we {{document}} four key stylized facts regarding the interaction between capital flows, fiscal policy, and monetary policy. First, net capital inflows are procyclical (i. e., external borrowing increases <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> and falls <b>in</b> bad times) in most OECD and developing countries. Second, fiscal policy is procyclical (i. e., government spending increases <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> and falls <b>in</b> bad times) {{for the majority of}} developing countries. Third, for emerging markets, monetary policy appears to be procyclical (i. e., policy rates are lowered <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> and raised <b>in</b> bad times). Fourth, in developing countries - and particularly for emerging markets - periods of capital inflows are associated with expansionary macroeconomic policies and periods of capital outflows with contractionary macroeconomic policies. In such countries, therefore, when it rains, it does indeed pour. ...|$|R

40|$|We build a {{model of}} the {{financial}} sector to explain why adverse asset shocks <b>in</b> <b>good</b> economic <b>times</b> lead to a sudden drying up of liquidity. Financial firms raise short-term debt in order to finance asset purchases. When asset fundamentals worsen, debt induces firms to risk-shift; this limits their funding liquidity and their ability to roll over debt. Firms may de-lever by selling assets to better-capitalized firms. Thus the market liquidity of assets depends on the severity of the asset shock and the system-wide distribution of leverage. This distribution of leverage is, however, itself endogenous to future prospects. In particular, short-term debt is relatively cheap to issue <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times</b> when expectations of asset fundamentals are benign, resulting in entry to the financial sector of firms with less capital or high leverage. Due to such entry, even though the incidence of financial crises is lower <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>times,</b> their severity <b>in</b> terms of de-leveraging and evaporation of market liquidity can in fact be greater. ...|$|R
