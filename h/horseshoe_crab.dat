Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer warm water, suggesting that {{they may be able to}} detect changes in water temperature. The overall goal of this study was to test this hypothesis. Our specific objectives were to: 1) find out if <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> can detect temperature changes; 2) determine the magnitude of temperature change they can detect, and; 3) determine whether their temperature receptors are located internally or externally. Animals were placed in a light-tight chamber that received a constant flow of cooled seawater. Their heart rates were continuously recorded and a change in heart rate following the addition of warmer water was used as an indicator that they sensed the change in temperature. The results showed that 50 % of <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> responded to a temperature change of 1 °C, while 100 % responded to a temperature change of 2. 6 °C. Over half of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> also responded to a rate of temperature change of less than 1. 5 °C. Both of these results indicate that <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> can, indeed, sense temperature changes. Also, the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crabs</b> typically showed a response before their internal temperature changed, indicating that their temperature receptors are most likely located externally...|$|R

25|$|Triops longicaudatus (commonly called longtail tadpole shrimp, American tadpole shrimp, or rice tadpole shrimp) is a {{freshwater}} crustacean of {{the order}} Notostraca, resembling a miniature <b>horseshoe</b> <b>crab.</b> It is characterized by an elongated, segmented body, a flattened shield-like brownish carapace covering {{two thirds of the}} thorax, and two long filaments on the abdomen. Triops refers to its three eyes, and longicaudatus refers to the elongated tail structures. Triops longicaudatus is found in freshwater ponds and pools, often in places where few higher forms of life can exist. Like its relative Triops cancriformis, the longtail tadpole shrimp is considered a living fossil because its basic prehistoric morphology has changed little in the last 70 million years, exactly matching their ancient fossils.

2500|$|In the {{alternative}} pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. [...] Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. [...] The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also {{formed by the}} Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [...] ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. [...] Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens.
