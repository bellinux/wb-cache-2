5|$|Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' {{isolation}} and {{dependence on the}} bounty {{of the natural world}} meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> Christianity until the arrival of Rev.

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E

I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, at a {{time when}} Nong Samet was being terrorized nightly by violent acts of banditry, local {{policing}} was so ineffective that the bandits could brag about their exploits in the marketplace. Finally, after a particularly blatant act of violence, three bandits who had identified themselves in the market the day before were found with their throats cut {{at the edge of the}} camp. Banditry decreased significantly in camp after this. Thou Thon thus demonstrated his willingness to use summary execution as a means of maintaining order.

According to 4th & B'way director Julian Palmer, the UK's demographic of young music buyers such as students was more progressive than in the United States, where he said the record {{would have to be}} marketed differently because of his race. He believed that much like Portishead, a contemporary Bristol act, Tricky would have received airplay in the US on alternative or college rock radio if the label focused their efforts to promote him there: [...] "Some people I've met were confused because he's black, and it's not easy to break through those barriers there."

500|$|In 2002, the World Wrestling Federation was {{court ordered}} {{to change its}} name, which <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> <b>to</b> [...] "WWE". Earlier that year, the WWF held a draft that split its roster into two {{distinctive}} brands, Raw and SmackDown, and ECW in 2006. Before the draft, matches included wrestlers from the roster without any limitations; after the draft, matches only consisted of wrestlers from their distinctive brands. The first No Way Out event to be produced under the WWE banner and with roster limitations was No Way Out (2003), which took place on February 23, 2003. Later that year, WWE announced that pay-per-view events, excluding WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and the Royal Rumble, would be made exclusive to each brand; No Way Out was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand. After three years of being produced as a brand exclusive event, No Way Out (2007) was the final No Way Out event (and the final pay-per-view overall) that was brand exclusive, as WWE announced that PPV events from then on would include all three brands of WWE.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the success}} of American {{producers}} such as Skrillex, Skream stated: [...] "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that {{is that a lot of}} people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E

500|$|Lecourbe {{made several}} feints {{on the bridge}} at Dillingheim, but his {{reconnaissance}} suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at Gremsheim, Blindheim and Höchstädt, which he did the next day. [...] A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi-Brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river. [...] After stripping their clothing and weapons, and loading them into a small raft, the naked men swam the river, pulling their weapons on rafts behind them. [...] Once reaching the other side, they took possession of several guns and some ammunition, wood, and materials. [...] Here they held their position until some artillery men managed to scramble across {{the wreck of the}} bridge at Gremsheim and support them. [...] The pioneers and bridge builders reconstructed the bridges under Austrian fire, allowing the remainder of the 94th crossed the river. [...] This accomplishment seemed to mark the turning point of the action, at least <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> Moreau, who mentioned it at length in his dispatch. A full Austrian Corps maintained a stand at Höchstädt, but were dislodged by repeated attacks of carabiners, cuirassiers and hussars, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and Würtembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.|$|E
