5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely <b>durum</b> wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and <b>durum</b> wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. <b>Durum</b> wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
25|$|Pasta: Dried {{pasta with}} three subcategories – (i.) <b>Durum</b> wheat {{semolina}} pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade <b>durum</b> wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) <b>Durum</b> wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category {{must be made}} only with <b>durum</b> wheat semolina or <b>durum</b> wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour {{as part of the}} <b>durum</b> flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>durum</b> {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, <b>durum</b> was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with <b>durum</b> wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and <b>durum</b> wheat breads.|$|E
25|$|<b>Durum</b> (T. durum)– A {{tetraploid}} form {{of wheat}} widely used today, {{and the second}} most widely cultivated wheat.|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, the Northern Plains Railroad {{employed}} 43 {{people and}} handled approximately 17,000 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included wheat, barley, <b>durum,</b> and soybeans.|$|E
25|$|Semolina flour is {{the ground}} {{endosperm}} of <b>durum</b> wheat, producing granules that absorb water during heating {{and an increase}} in viscosity due to semi-reordering of starch molecules.|$|E
25|$|<b>Durum</b> wheat is {{the result}} of the inter-species {{hybridization}} of two diploid grass species Triticum urartu and Aegilops speltoides. Both diploid ancestors had two sets of 7 chromosomes, which were similar in terms of size and genes contained on them. <b>Durum</b> wheat contains two sets of chromosomes derived from Triticum urartu and two sets of chromosomes derived from Aegilops speltoides. Each chromosome pair derived from the Triticum urartu parent is homoeologous to the opposite chromosome pair derived from the Aegilops speltoides parent, though each chromosome pair unto itself is homologous.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic hexaploids made by {{crossing}} the wild goatgrass wheat ancestor Aegilops tauschii and various <b>durum</b> wheats {{are now being}} deployed, and these increase the genetic diversity of cultivated wheats.|$|E
25|$|Emmer wheat (triticum dicoccum) was {{initially}} {{the most widespread}} variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, <b>durum</b> wheat (triticum <b>durum),</b> a descendent of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. <b>Durum</b> grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore {{be separated from the}} husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Durum</b> wheat, the {{preferred}} variety for making pasta; grown {{mostly in the}} states of North Dakota and Montana to an average production level of 4%. The byproducts resulting from milling of all the above varieties is used to feed animals.|$|E
25|$|Whole wheat {{macaroni}} products – {{similar to}} macaroni products except that only {{whole wheat flour}} or whole wheat <b>durum</b> flour, or both, {{may be used as}} the wheat ingredient. Further the addition of the various forms of egg whites, disodium phosphate and gum gluten are not permitted.|$|E
25|$|Special pastas (paste speciali): As Pasta above, with {{additional}} ingredients other than flour and water or eggs. Special pastas must {{be labeled as}} <b>durum</b> wheat semolina pasta on the packaging completed by mentioning the added ingredients used (e.g., spinach). The 3% soft flour limitation still applies.|$|E
25|$|Hexaploid wheats {{evolved in}} farmers' fields. Either domesticated emmer or <b>durum</b> wheat hybridized {{with yet another}} wild diploid grass (Aegilops tauschii) to make the {{hexaploid}} wheats, spelt wheat and bread wheat. These have three sets of paired chromosomes, {{three times as many}} as in diploid wheat.|$|E
25|$|In North Africa, a food {{similar to}} pasta, known as couscous, has been eaten for centuries. However, {{it lacks the}} {{distinguishing}} malleable nature of pasta, couscous being more akin to droplets of dough. At first, dry pasta was a luxury item in Italy because of high labor costs; <b>durum</b> wheat semolina had to be kneaded for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Also {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a <b>durum</b> wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of Cato, basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina, with <b>durum</b> wheat used {{predominantly}} in the South of Italy and soft wheat in the North. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours.|$|E
25|$|Egg pasta (pasta all'uovo): May only be {{manufactured}} using <b>durum</b> wheat semolina {{with at least}} 4 hens’ eggs (chicken) weighing at least 200grams (without the shells) per kilogram of semolina, or a liquid egg product produced only with hen’s eggs. Pasta made and sold in Italy under this category must be labeled egg pasta.|$|E
25|$|A. fulvescens {{refers to}} the sexual state, or teleomorph, of the organism. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is {{regarded}} by some mycologists as the asexual state, or anamorph, however others argue that {{this is only the}} asexual state of Aphanoascus keratinophilus. Aphanoascus fulvescens, Aphanoascus terreus, Aphanoascus canadensis, Aphanoascus reticulisporus, and Keratinophyton <b>durum</b> or Anixiopsis biplanata are the species that are currently accepted under the genus Aphanoascus.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the wheat protein gluten. This protein can {{determine}} the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The gluten protein in <b>durum</b> wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.|$|E
25|$|Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include {{vitamins}} and minerals that are lost from the <b>durum</b> wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground. Vitamins added include niacin (Vitamin B3), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), folic acid (Vitamin B9) and thiamine (Vitamin B1), added back {{in the form of}} thiamin mononitrate. Ferrous iron is also included as a supplement.|$|E
25|$|Noodle {{products}} – are {{the class}} of food that is prepared by drying units of dough made from semolina, <b>durum</b> flour, farina, flour, alone or in any combination with liquid eggs, frozen eggs, dried eggs, egg yolks, frozen yolks, dried yolks, alone or in any combination, with or without water. Optional ingredients that may be added in allowed amounts are onions, celery, garlic, and bay leaf; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 50% of {{the wheat}} {{produced}} in the US is exported, although {{the share of the}} world market has declined due to competition from the EU, Argentina, Australia, Canada, and also recently from Ukraine and Russia. The exported wheat varieties are white wheat (about 66%), Hard Red Spring (about 50%), Soft Red Winter, and <b>durum</b> wheat. However, the producers continue to increase exports as in the domestic market wheat products have not been competitive in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Couscous is {{distinct}} from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, {{in that it is}} made from crushed <b>durum</b> wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed. Burghul or bulgur is a kind of parboiled dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.|$|E
25|$|Grain color (red, {{white or}} amber). Many wheat {{varieties}} are reddish-brown due to phenolic compounds {{present in the}} bran layer which are transformed to pigments by browning enzymes. White wheats have a lower content of phenolics and browning enzymes, and are generally less astringent in taste than red wheats. The yellowish color of <b>durum</b> wheat and semolina flour made from it {{is due to a}} carotenoid pigment called lutein, which can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.|$|E
25|$|MTs {{are present}} in a vast range of taxonomic groups, ranging from prokaryotes (such as the {{cyanobacteria}} Synechococcus sp.), protozoa (such as the ciliate Tetrahymena genera), plants (such as Pisum sativum, Triticum <b>durum,</b> Zea mays, or Quercus suber), yeast (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Candida albicans), invertebrates (such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the mollusc Mytilus edulis, or the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and vertebrates (such as the chicken Gallus gallus, or the mammalian Homo sapiens or Mus musculus).|$|E
25|$|Most {{tetraploid}} wheats (e.g. emmer and <b>durum</b> wheat) {{are derived}} from wild emmer, T. dicoccoides. Wild emmer is itself {{the result of a}} hybridization between two diploid wild grasses, T. urartu and a wild goatgrass such as Aegilops searsii or Ae. speltoides. The unknown grass has never been identified among now surviving wild grasses, but the closest living relative is Aegilops speltoides. The hybridization that formed wild emmer (AABB) occurred in the wild, long before domestication, and was driven by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Macaroni {{products}} – {{is defined}} as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, <b>durum</b> flour, farina, flour, or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including egg white, frozen egg white or dried egg white alone or in any combination; disodium phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Agriculture defines eight {{official}} {{classes of}} wheat: <b>durum</b> wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat. Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 {{percent of total}} production in the U.S., with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The U.S. hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year {{to the extent of}} 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Durum</b> wheat {{is ground}} into {{semolina}} flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Raw wheat can {{be ground}} into flour or, using hard <b>durum</b> wheat only, can be ground into semolina; germinated and dried {{creating}} malt; crushed or cut into cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into bulgur {{also known as}} groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used several ways. Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, porridge, crackers, biscuits, Muesli, pancakes, pies, pastries, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza (a fermented beverage), and breakfast cereals.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory allergies are an {{occupational}} disease that develop in food service workers. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat; some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens. A later study showed that baker's allergy extend over {{a broad range of}} cereal grasses (wheat, <b>durum</b> wheat, triticale, cereal rye, barley, rye grass, oats, canary grass, rice, maize, sorghum and Johnson grass) though the greatest similarities were seen between wheat and rye, and that these allergies show cross reactivity between seed proteins and pollen proteins, including a prominent crossreactivity between the common environment rye pollen and wheat gluten.|$|E
25|$|From the 8th {{century to}} the 13th century in Muslim lands many crops and plants were planted along Muslim trade routes, farming {{techniques}} spread. In addition to changes in economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, urban growth, {{the distribution of the}} labour force, and numerous other aspects of life in the Islamic world were affected according to Andrew Watson. However this is disputed by other scholars, who claim cultivation and consumption of staples such as <b>durum</b> wheat, Asiatic rice, and sorghum as well as cotton were already commonplace centuries before, or that agricultural production declined in areas brought under Muslim rule in the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Wheat is {{a staple}} crop from Canada. To help homesteaders attain an {{abundance}} harvest in a foreshortened growing season, varieties of wheat were {{developed at the}} beginning of the twentieth century. Red Fife was the first strain; it was a wheat which could be seeded in the fall and sprout in the early spring. Red Fife ripened nearly two weeks sooner and was a harder wheat than other spring wheats. Dr. C. Saunders, experimented further with Red Fife, and developed Marquis Wheat, which was resistant to rust and came to maturity within 100 days. Some other types of wheat grown are <b>durum,</b> spelt, and winter wheat. In recent years, Canadian farmers have also begun to grow rice.|$|E
