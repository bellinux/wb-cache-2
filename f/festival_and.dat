40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} roles of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events in {{economic and social}} development activities in Wales, examining in particular rural/urban differences. The potential use of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events in {{economic and social development}} processes is then explored, both in the literature, and via a survey of the activities of the 22 Unitary Authorities in Wales regarding <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events. The results highlight {{that the vast majority of}} <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events are local in scope, and focus on social capital building. They are also strongly correlated with self employment and rurality. In terms of resourcing local (entrepreneurial) resources may also be supplementing or replacing those from unitary authorities. There is a need to evaluate <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events in more sophisticated ways than the traditional economic impact or marketing focus. It may be possible to develop approaches to maximize the social capital building aspects which are most suited to social and general entrepreneurial activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events, coupled with their {{positive and negative}} impacts on host communities, {{has led to a}} growing body of research on the impacts of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events. As a substantial amount of this research has focused on assessing the economic impacts of festivals, there is growing demand for the measurement of the socio-cultural impacts of these <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events. To address this issue a study was conducted that developed a framework for the social impact evaluation of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> piloted a tool that measured the community perceptions of socio-cultural impacts. This paper has four aims. First, it provides an overview of the importance of understanding community perceptions of socio-cultural impacts that may arise from the staging of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events. Second, the paper outlines a Social Impact Evaluation (SIE) framework suitable for the holistic evaluation of socio-cultural impacts of <b>festivals</b> <b>and</b> events. Third the paper reports on the piloting of a tool, the Social Impact Perception (SIP) scale that was created to measure community perceptions of socio-cultural impacts that may arise from the staging of a small community festival. Fourth, the paper provides recommendations for the future application of the SIE framework and the SIP scale...|$|R
