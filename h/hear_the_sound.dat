5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a gunshotfrom the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walshand they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
5|$|They move {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that night, they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Seguida {{group was}} founded {{by a group of}} New York musicians whose ancestry was of Puerto Rican heritage. They were brought up in the urban South Bronx barrios where musical influences were a mixed bag. In these barrios, it wasn’t unusual to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of James Brown and Funkadelic coming from one apartment, while in another <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of Larry Harlow, Eddie Palmieri and Ray Barretto and still in another apartment you could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> Beatles, Cream, Motown, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin.|$|R

CCTV {{reported}} that search teams heard people yelling from within the ship. 1,000 police officers from the Hubei Armed Police Corps {{were sent to the}} site with 40 inflatable boats. Authorities reported that the search and rescue effort included 3,000 people and 50 boats. Crews used both underwater approaches with diving apparatus, and above-water approaches through holes cut through the inverted hull.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} building holds a local {{reputation as}} the locale of various paranormal activity, with visitors and local residents claiming to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of rattling chains or wagon wheels and horses' hooves, seeing smoke (presumably from soldiers' pipes), spotting apparitions {{of a woman in}} a hoop skirt, and smelling a strong lavender violet perfume. The Drum Barracks was profiled on Unsolved Mysteries in the early 1990s in a segment called 'Civil War Ghosts'. Some of the people interviewed in that segment claimed to have seen apparitions of Civil War soldiers. In 2005 the Barracks was featured in an episode of Most Haunted.|$|E
25|$|In November 1834 Nimble {{pursued the}} Spanish slave ship Carlota {{until she was}} wrecked on the Cuban coast. Nimble rescued 272 African slaves, which contributed to her wrecking. On the way to Havana Nimble met bad weather, and on 4 November was driven onto a reef near Cay Verde {{on the north side}} of the Old Bahama Channel. The ship was lost and 70 of the Africans drowned. It was {{reported}} that the Africans in the hold were making so much noise that the crew could not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the breakers on the reef. All her crew were saved, as were some 200 slaves.|$|E

25|$|Many of the horse-drawn {{carriages}} from Central Park stay in stables {{just off}} the West Side Highway. It {{is not uncommon to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of horses in the neighborhood. There have been calls for banning horse-drawn carriages, especially from Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio following a handful of collisions between cars and carriages. The carriage horses live in historic stables originally built in the 19th century, but today boast the latest in barn design, such as fans, misting systems, box stalls, and state-of-the-art sprinkler systems. As horses always have in densely populated urban areas, the carriage horses live upstairs in their stables while the carriages are parked below on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker's 2nd Division of the III Corps was {{the lead}} {{infantry}} in the Union Army advance. They assaulted Fort Magruder and a line of rifle pits and smaller fortifications that extended in an arc southwest from the fort, but were repulsed. Confederate counterattacks, directed by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet, threatened to overwhelm Hooker's division, which had contested the ground alone since the early morning {{while waiting for the}} main body of the army to arrive. Hooker had expected Baldy Smith's division of the IV Corps, marching north on the Yorktown Road, to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of battle and come in on Hooker's right in support. However, Smith had been halted by Sumner more than a mile away from Hooker's position. He had been concerned that the Confederates would leave their fortifications and attack him on the Yorktown Road.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b> If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E

500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, {{unless you want to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Heylin {{points out}} that the {{gorgeous}} tune illustrates what Dylan explained to a reporter in 1966: [...] "It's not just pretty words to a tune or putting tunes to words... the words and the music —I can <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of what I want to say." [...] Al Kooper has said that of all the songs that Dylan had outlined to him in his hotel, this was his favorite, so Dylan delayed recording it to {{the very end of the}} Nashville sessions, [...] "just to bug him". Released as a single in June 1966, shortly before the album Blonde on Blonde, [...] "I Want You" [...] reached number 20 in the USA, and number 16 in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Those in the {{lifeboats}} were {{horrified to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of what Lawrence Beesley called [...] "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled– I am certain of those– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How {{is it possible}} that this awful thing is happening to me? That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E

The station is themed to the abandoned sawmill in the town of Gold Rush and tells the story of Jack Darke. [...] Within the building, guests are directed through a series of queue switchbacks and pathways. Several television screens are embedded in the walls and show burning timber. Parts of the theming are caged off with crime scene signs. Throughout the queue, guests are able to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of buzzsaws as well as several warnings to not go any further and to escape while they can. Large circular saws (a.k.a. buzzsaws) are located on the side and roof of the building.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} the {{rattling}} made by rattlesnakes of different species, the Canadian zoologists Brock Fenton and Lawrence Licht found that the sounds are always similar: they have rapid onset (starting suddenly, and reaching full volume in a few milliseconds); they consist of a [...] "broadband" [...] mixture of frequencies between 2kHz and 20kHz, with little energy either in the ultrasonic (above 20kHz) or in the rattlesnakes' hearing range (below 700Hz); and the frequencies do not change much with time (the rattling after 2 minutes having a similar spectrum to that at onset). There was no clear difference in the sounds made by the different species measured: Crotalus horridus, Crotalus adamanteus, Crotalus atrox, Crotalus cerastes, Crotalus viridis and Sistrurus catenatus. This pattern implies that the rattling [...] "could serve as a general attention-getting device", which [...] "is designed as a deimatic or startle display". Its similarity to the [...] "broadband, harsh sounds" [...] used as warning calls by birds and mammals may enhance its effectiveness. Since rattlesnakes can barely <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound,</b> it is unlikely to serve as any form of communication to other snakes of the same species. Finally, the sounds are not in themselves loud enough to cause pain and hence keep predators away.|$|E

500|$|The four collaborated {{to write}} {{numerous}} [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{of a security}} camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and {{run out of the}} way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Church's vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the team's documents and defined the game's design and direction, and Grossman wrote the game's original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|E
500|$|The {{three women}} plot their {{strategy}} ("Gaie Comari di Windsor" [...] / [...] "Merry wives of Windsor, {{the time has}} come!"). They are in high spirits, but Alice notices that Nannetta is not. This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius, a man {{old enough to be}} her grandfather; the women reassure her that they will prevent it. Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff's arrival, and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness. Falstaff's attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past glory ("Quand'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk" [...] / [...] "When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender") are cut short, as Mistress Quickly reports the impending arrival of Ford with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife's lover. Falstaff hides first behind the screen, and then the women hide him in the laundry basket. In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide behind the screen. The men <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a kiss behind it. They assume it is Falstaff with Alice, but instead they find the young lovers. Ford orders Fenton to leave. Inside the hamper Falstaff is almost suffocating. While the men resume the search of the house Alice orders her servants to throw the laundry basket through the window into the River Thames, where Falstaff endures the jeers of the crowd.|$|E
