6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> him {{deliberately}} to {{keep the}} delusion up. [...] "I have a terrible grinding pain in my chest," [...] I said, pretending to writhe. I had sunk to his level, it seems. I was a liar and a murderer.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> {{him with}} my face, and with my eyes, and with my lips. [...] "It is no dream," [...] I said softly. [...] "I have come to you, Adrian, because I want you. No one else would do." ...|$|E

60|$|Some {{time after}} this Gr-gr-gr {{came through the}} fields where we were, and his son spoke to him upon the subject, but the old gentleman was evidently in {{anything}} but a good humor, for he cuffed the youngster and, turning upon me, informed {{me that he was}} convinced that <b>I</b> had <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> him, and that I was one of Hooja's peo-ple.|$|R

5000|$|Judge Mactavish {{stated that}} Long {{did not provide}} {{evidence}} to show he would be singled out for harsh treatment by the U.S. military because of the publicity associated with case. However, a month later, on August 22, 2008, in Long's court martial trial in the United States,"Prosecutors called no witnesses to disparage Long's character. Instead, they showed a six-minute video of Long, sporting dreadlocks and a beard, telling a Canadian news reporter [...] "I think <b>I</b> was <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> by my president." ...|$|R

I set myself to drive that doubt away--I set myself to fill her mind with {{pleasant}} things again. <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her, and in lying to her I lied also to myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too ready to forget.|$|E

60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I do {{not know}} it. I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before God's altar and ask God's blessing on so hideous a mockery as a {{marriage}} between me and George Harford. I will not say the words the Church bids us to say. I will not say them. I dare not. How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin? No: marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other. It is not for such as him, or such as me. Gerald, to save you from the world's sneers and taunts <b>I</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> the world. For twenty years <b>I</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> the world. <b>I</b> could not tell the world the truth. Who can, ever? But not for my own sake will I lie to God, and in God's presence. No, Gerald, no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford. It may be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, {{so that in the}} mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so.|$|R

Yes, MY child," [...] {{she said}} frantically, {{tightening}} her hold upon his hand, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> you when I once told you I had none. I had a child, and, more than that, a child who at his birth I did not dare to openly claim." ...|$|E
50|$|Adams has {{identified}} his father's death in 2006 {{as one of}} the defining events of his life. In a 2012 interview, Adams recalled: When I lost my dad, that was a big hit for me. I didn't have that parental guidance, and I kind of took advantage of it because I was a stupid idiot. I decided not to go to school a couple of times, go when I felt like it. <b>I</b> always <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> my brothers and sisters. They'd ask: 'Are you going to school?' I'd say 'yeah'. They eventually found out.|$|R

Oblivious to the situation, the manager advised Paar to calm down, saying it was [...] "all a tempest in a teapot".|$|R
60|$|That was {{the happiest}} evening of my life; nor ever do I expect to {{experience}} its like; but at last, {{as is the}} way of happiness, it terminated. We descended to the compound, and <b>I</b> walked with <b>Lys</b> <b>to</b> the door of her quarters. There again she kissed me and bade me good night, and then she went in and closed the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fine. Sally, {{you have}} ideas in your pretty little head. And once I thought it held nothing but--" [...] She {{put a hand}} on my mouth.

6000|$|... "People {{talked to}} you in Paris about us," [...] she continued, [...] "about Anna the virtuous and Annabel the rake. You were accused of having been seen with the latter. You denied it, remembering that I had called myself Anna. You went even to our rooms and saw my sister. Anna lied to you, <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> you. I was Annabel the rake, 'Alcide' of the music halls. My name is Annabel, not Anna. Do you understand?" ...|$|E

2500|$|He first worked near {{home as a}} radio {{announcer}} at WIBM in Jackson, Michigan, [...] and later as a humorous disc jockey at Midwest stations, including WJR in Detroit, WIRE in Indianapolis, WGAR in Cleveland, and WBEN in Buffalo. In his book P.S. Jack Paar, he recalled doing utility duty at WGAR in 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast his famous simulated alien invasion, The War of the Worlds, over the CBS network (and its WGAR affiliate).

6000|$|... "I cannot stay. You will acknowledge, Violet, that <b>I</b> {{have never}} <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> you. <b>I</b> am {{thinking}} of you day and night.

6000|$|... "I {{will pass}} it, I will pass it," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "but, by God! {{it is more than}} I have had to swallow in all my life before. Look at your grandfather, sir!" [...] he cried; [...] "behold him on the very brink of the grave, and ask me again why <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> him! His hope of heaven is scarce less sacred to him than his love of the King, and both are so tightly wrapped about his heart that this {{knowledge}} of you would break it.

60|$|Happen I know her! Yes, {{that was}} the boy's odd phrase. It rang in my ears, and I found myself gasping for breath. My eyes were fixed upon that tall, slender figure, clothed in sober black, waiting upon the {{doorstep}} with bowed head, and standing very still and motionless. It was like an effigy of patience. There were not two {{women in the world}} like that; it was impossible. She was in England, and alone--free! What did it mean? Should I run to her, or hide away? I glanced over my shoulder where the black shadows of the tunnel were only dimly lit by the feeble gaslight. I could steal away, and she would never see me. Yet as I thought of it, the grimy, barren street and the solemn-looking building faded away before my eyes. The sun and wind burned my face; the wind, salt with ocean spray, and echoing with the hoarse screaming of the sea-birds that rode upon it. I was at Cruta again, panting to be free, stealing away in the twilight down the narrow path amongst the rocks to where that tiny boat lay waiting, like a speck upon the waters. And it was she who had helped me--the sad-faced woman who had braved the terrible anger of the man whom we had both dreaded. Again I heard her gentle words of counsel, and the answering lies which should have blistered my lips. For <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her, not hastily or on impulse, but deliberately in cold blood. Anything, I cried to myself, to escape from this rock, this living death! So <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her, and she helped me. No wonder that I trembled. No wonder that I half made up my mind to flee away into the sheltering darkness of that noisome-looking tunnel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} that; I never dropped it. On the contrary, I {{had picked up}} the mate of it very near where you found yours, and I wanted to know to whom it belonged. For I don't mind telling you now, Collinson, that I believe there WAS a woman in that house, and the same woman whose face I saw at the window. You {{remember}} how the boys joked me about it--well, perhaps I didn't care that you should laugh at me too, but I've had a sore conscience over my lie, for I remembered that you seemed to have some interest in the matter too, and I thought that maybe I might have thrown you off the scent. It seemed to me that if you had any idea who it was, we might now talk the matter over and compare notes. I think you said--at least, I gathered the idea from a remark of yours," [...] he added hastily, as he remembered that the suggestion was his own, and a satirical one--"that it reminded you of your wife's slipper. Of course, as your wife is dead, that would offer no clue, and can only be a chance resemblance, unless"-- He stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Misery! What misery? Why {{should she}} be miserable? Must a woman need be miserable because {{she lives with}} her husband? You hear me say that I will forgive everything.

60|$|From what Anatole had said, I {{had already}} {{concluded}} that Marsac had exercised the greatest reticence. But the interview between {{his sister and}} Roxalanne filled me with the gravest anxiety. Women are not wont to practise the restraint of men under such circumstances, {{and for all that}} Mademoiselle de Marsac may not have expressed it in so many words that I was her faithless lover, yet women are quick to detect and interpret the signs of disorders springing from such causes, and I had every fear that Roxalanne was {{come to the conclusion that}} <b>I</b> had <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her yesternight. With an uneasy spirit, then, I went in quest of her, and I found her walking in the old rose garden behind the chateau.|$|R
