40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of surface treatment with Er:YAG laser on shear bond streng- th (SBS) of orthodontic brackets to fi ber-reinforced composite (FRC). Study Design: Ninety human premolars were randomly divided into six groups of 15. FRC bars were bonded to the teeth with a fl owable composite (FC) and then underwent following treatments. In group 1 no further treatment was performed. In group 2 the FRC surfaces were covered by FC. An Er:YAG laser was employed to treat FRCs in groups 3 (200 mJ/ 10 Hz) and 4 (300 mJ/ 15 Hz). The FRC strips in groups 5 and 6 were fi rst covered by FC and then irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 200 mJ/ 10 Hz (group 5) or 300 mJ/ 15 Hz (group 6). Stainless steel brackets were bonded to FRCs using a light-cure adhesive system. After 24 hours, the samples were tested for SBS and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were determined. Results: There was a signifi cant difference in SBS among the study groups (P < 0. 001). Pairwise comparisons in- dicated that SBS was signifi cantly lower in group 1 compared to all other groups (p< 0. 05) except group 2. Bond strength in group 6 was signifi cantly greater than all the study groups (p< 0. 05) except group 5. No signifi cant di- <b>fference</b> <b>was</b> found in ARI scores among the groups. Conclusions: Covering the FRC surface by a layer of fl owable composite and then application of Er:YAG laser at 300 mJ/ 15 Hz could be recommended to increase bond strength of orthodontic attachments to FRC...|$|E

When {{population}} parameters of intel lectual abi l i ties are estimated from a twin sample, cr i tics {{point to the}} twin– singleton di fferences in intrauter ine and fami ly envi ronments. These di <b>fferences</b> <b>are</b> suggested to lead to suboptimal cogni tive development in twins. A l though previous studies have repor ted twin– singleton di fferences in intel l igence, these studies had two major drawbacks: they tested young twins, and twins were compared wi th (genetical ly) unrelated singletons. To test accurately whether twin–singleton di fferences in intel l igence exist, a group of adul t tw ins and thei r non-twin sibl ings were administered the Dutch WAIS-I I I.

No evidence of di fferences between adul t tw ins and thei r non-twin sibl ings on cogni tive per formance was found.

40|$|Stylometric {{analysis}} of prose is typically limited to classification {{tasks such as}} authorship attribution. Since the models used are typically black boxes, they give little insight into the stylistic diff erences they detect. In this paper, we characterize two prose genres syntactically: chick lit (humorous novels on the challenges of being a modern-day urban female) and high literature. First, we develop a top-down computational method based on existing literary-linguistic theory. Using an o -the-shelf parser we obtain syntactic structures for a Dutch corpus of novels and measure the distribution of sentence types in chick-lit and literary novels. The results show that literature contains more complex (subordinating) sentences than chick lit. Secondly, a bottom-up analysis is made of specific morphological and syntactic features in both genres, based on the parser’s output. This shows that the two genres can be distinguished along certain features. Our results indicate that detailed insight into stylistic di <b>fferences</b> can <b>be</b> obtained by combining computational linguistic analysis with literary theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{residential}} and housing inequality {{in the cities}} under central planning has a long tradition. However, previous studies have mostly focused on age and social segregation, while ethnic di. <b>fferences</b> have <b>been</b> poorly investigated. This research clarifies the ethnic di. fferences in housing ownership and living conditions in Tartu, Estonia, in the Sovi et period. We use individual-level data from the 1989 census and multivariate analysis. Our analysis shows that, first, non-Estonians had better access ta state housing than Estonians. The ethnic di. fferences decrease, but remain significant when controlling for compositional di. fferences. Second, it appears that Estonians had more living space, while non-Estonians lived in more comfortable conditions. Di. fferences in housing ownership and population composition explain most af the ethnic di. fferences in housing size, but the di. fferences in housingfacilities remain. We argue that both the state policy and the di. fferent traditions and values {{were responsible for the}} housing di. fferences between Estonians and non-Estonians in Tartu during the Soviet period. The role af the pre-WWII legacy should be considered as well...|$|R
40|$|Among all {{possible}} realizations of quark and antiquark assembly, the nucleon (the proton and the neutron) {{is the most}} stable of all hadrons and consequently {{has been the subject}} of intensive studies. Mass, shape, radius and more complex representations of its internal structure are measured since several decades using di fferent probes. The proton (spin 1 / 2) is described by the electric GE and magnetic GM form factors which characterise its internal structure. Thernsimplest way to measure the proton form factors consists in measuring the angular distribution of the electron-proton elastic scattering accessing the so-called Space-Like region where q 2 e+e-, one accesses another kinematical region, the so-calledrnTime-Like region where q 2 > 0. However, due to the antiproton proton e+e- threshold q 2 th, only the kinematical domain q 2 > q 2 th > 0 is available. To access the unphysical region, one may use the antiproton proton [...] > pi 0 e+ e- reaction where the pi 0 takes away a part of the system energy allowing q 2 to bernvaried between q 2 th and almost 0. This thesis aims to show the feasibility of such measurements with the PANDA detector which will be installed on the new high intensity antiproton ring at the FAIR facility at Darmstadt. rnTo describe the antiproton proton [...] > pi 0 e+ e- reaction, a Lagrangian based approach is developed. The 5 -fold diff erential cross section is determined and related to linear combinations of hadronic tensors. Under the assumption of one nucleon exchange, the hadronic tensors are expressed in terms of the 2 complex proton electromagnetic form factors. An extraction method which provides anrnaccess to the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio R = |GE|/|GM| and for the first time in an unpolarized experiment to the cosine of the phase di <b>fference</b> <b>is</b> developed. Such measurements have never been performed in the unphysical region up to now. Extended simulations were performed to show how the ratio R and the cosine can be extracted from the positron angular distribution. Furthermore, a model is developed for the antiproton proton [...] > pi 0 pi+ pi- background reaction considered as the most dangerous one. The background to signal cross section ratio was estimated under diff erent cut combinations of the particle identi cation information from the di fferent detectors and of the kinematic fits. The background contribution can be reduced to the percent level or even less. The corresponding signal efficiency ranges from a few % to 30 %. The precision on the determination of the ratio R and of the cosine is determined using the expected counting rates via Monte Carlo method. A part of this thesis is also dedicated to more technical work with the study of the prototype of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the determination of its resolutio...|$|R
40|$|Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DD) models {{provide a}} {{framework}} to advance the understanding of plasticity. However, existing DD models currently do not account for multiphysical effects. Multiphysical phenomena are often present during plastic deformation. Two particular examples are the electromechanical behavior of plastically deformed piezoelectric materials and the thermomechanical behavior of metals under high strain rate plastic deformation. Thus, I present two new DD models, that take these behaviors into account. The basic carriers of plastic deformation are dislocations, which are crystallographic defects. Therefore, in the two new DD models, dislocations are directly modeled as crystallographic line defects in an elastic continuum. These models {{are based on the}} Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which is a versatile tool used to analyze discontinuities, singularities, localized deformations, and complex geometries. The XFEM captures the slip from edge dislocations by way of Heaviside step enrichment function. This paper starts with the first fully coupled two-dimensional electromechanical Discrete Dislocation Dynamics model (EM-XFEM-DD) for anisotropic piezoelectric crystalline solids undergoing plastic deformation. The strong, weak, and discrete forms of the boundary value problem for the coupled system are presented. The computation of the Peach-Koehler force, the force driving dislocation motion, using the J-integral is discussed. The EM-XFEM-DD model for a domain with a single edge dislocation was verified by comparison with the solution obtained using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Lagrange Multipliers. The piezoelectrical effect on the Peach-Koehler force on a single dislocation in a finite domain is evaluated. This effect is significant and can affect both the direction and magnitude of the force. The motion of a network of dislocations under different electrical and mechanical loads is simulated. The simulations demonstrate that for piezoelectric materials, the plastic response di ffers considerably when various electric potential di <b>fferences</b> <b>are</b> applied. In addition, the simulations illustrate that the physics of plasticity under electromechanical loads are more complex than in purely mechanical systems. Next, the first fully coupled two-dimensional thermomechanical Discrete Dislocation Dynamics model (TM-XFEM-DD) is developed. Since high strain rate plastic deformation leads to significant temperature rises due to the rapid rate of heat generation by dislocation motion, each dislocation is considered as a moving heat source. The strength of each heat source is the work done by the Peach-Koehler force on each dislocation. The TM-XFEM- DD model also accounts for the temperature dependence of dislocation drag. Parametric studies show that the temperature dependence of dislocation drag does not significantly impact the observed stress-strain response at low loading rates, but it is significant at higher loading rates. The simulations using TM-XFEM-DD qualitatively capture the salient properties of high strain rate plastic deformation, such as the increased importance of thermal effects with increased strain rate. Higher temperature increase is observed in specimens deformed at higher strain rates. In addition, the predicted stress-strain response of the TM-XFEM-DD model is softer than that predicted by a purely mechanical DD model. This softening effect is found to be stronger {{in the case of the}} adiabatic heating versus fixed temperature change on the boundary of the domain. Overall, the development of these two models that incorporate electro- and thermomechanical coupling will allow for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of plastic deformation at the mesoscale...|$|R
