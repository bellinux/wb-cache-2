30|$|The three {{investigated}} {{methods of}} flexible pavement design are the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) method {{known as the}} California (<b>Hveem)</b> <b>method,</b> the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) method, and the Asphalt Institute (AI) method. The Caltrans and AASHTO methods are two empirical methods of flexible pavement design and they deploy relative strength indicators as the main basis {{for the design of}} pavement structures. The Caltrans and AASHTO methods use gravel equivalent (GE) and structural number (SN) as the design relative strength indicators, respectively [5, 10]. The AI method applies a mechanistic approach to obtain design solutions assuming linear elastic multi-layered pavement systems [6]. The AI method directly generates layer thicknesses that can be converted into an indicator of pavement relative strength. Therefore, the pavement relative strength indicators used in the proposed two-stage design analysis approach are the gravel equivalent, structural number, and layer thicknesses.|$|E
40|$|Application {{of quality}} {{management}} concepts to asphalt paving evolved because recipe specifications frequently proved inadequate for ensuring pavement performance. Quality management of asphalt concrete {{is founded on}} the premise that the producer controls the end-quality of the product, including the in-place void content on which pavement performance is highly dependent. In its quality management program the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) originally used the Marshall hammer, since neither the Hveem (kneading) nor Superpave prototype compactor was suitable for field quality control/assurance (QC/QA). Post-SHRP research {{led to the development of}} truly portable gyratory compactors, ie, those of 70 kg to 140 kg mass. Although selecting and proportioning materials as well as compaction are integral parts of the Superpave technology, there is some apprehension given the fact that no strength test is required at low traffic levels. Given ODOT’s long and successful use of the <b>Hveem</b> <b>method</b> of mix design, the primary objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness o...|$|E
40|$|Aggregates and binder are the {{two main}} {{constituents}} that make up hot mix asphalt (HMA). Since {{a wide variety of}} mineral aggregate is used to produce Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), proper evaluation of the mineral aggregate properties is important to ensure good performance of asphalt mixture. Unlike Superpave system, Marshall and <b>Hveem</b> <b>method</b> do not incorporate aggregate criteria into their procedures. The Superpave Highway Research Programme (SHRP) modified the Delphi process to include aggregate properties which are divided into two categories; consensus and source. The consensus properties include aggregate angularity, flat and elongated particles and sand equivalent to ensure aggregate quality is sufficient to provide satisfactory HMA performance for all design traffic levels. The source properties are often used to qualify local source of aggregate which include abrasion, deleterious materials and soundness test. In this study, granite aggregates were collected from northern, central and southern region of Peninsular Malaysia. Results of the aggregate testing showed that Malaysian aggregates are durable and of good quality. These aggregates conformed to the criteria as required in the Superpave system, hence suitable for use in the mix design...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{increasing}} cost of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures and the limited availability of good materials, cold in-place recycling (CIR) offers an attractive alternative for rehabilitating asphalt pavements. Because of its limited performance history and the unavailability of a standard mix-design procedure, the use of CIR mixtures has been limited to low-and medium-volume roads. For more than a decade, many highway agencies have experimented with or used CIR mixtures and reported numerous successes. The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) is currently using CIR on low- and medium-volume roads. The CIR layer is treated as a stabilized base course followed by a thin HMA overlay. As part of this program, NDOT developed a mix-design procedure based on the <b>Hveem</b> mix-design <b>method</b> to establish the optimum moisture and emulsion contents. The design procedure evaluates the moisture sensitivity of the CIR mixture and determines the need for lime treatment of the CIR mix. The basic concept of the mix design is to assess {{the ability of the}} CIR process in providing a flexible and stable mix that can withstand the combined action of traffic loads and environment. The designed CIR mixtures were implemented on three field projects and showed excellent performance, which led NDOT to construct additional CIR projects. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Eco-friendliness, energy {{efficiency}} and cost effectiveness are major drivers responsible for cold recycled asphalt mixtures being considered as alternatives to hot mixtures. Although such mixtures are still regarded in some quarters as second class asphalt, results from field trials on such materials under temperate climates {{have been reported to}} be highly impressive and encouraging. Some developed countries with temperate climates have since developed guidelines for the production and use of cold mixtures in road building. However, evidence from the literature shows that little or nothing has been done to ascertain the performance and suitability of such sustainable materials in developing countries located in hot tropical climates. Ascertaining the performances of such will, among other things enable the formulation of guidelines required for producing and using these alternative sustainable materials and methods in developing countries with hot tropical climates, where available funds for road building are increasingly inadequate to meet demand. The work reported in this thesis attempts to simulate what should be expected in terms of the performance of flexible pavements containing cold mixes of bitumen emulsion stabilized RAP as road base in hot climates. Cold recycling in-plant was deemed appropriate for the obvious reason that it enables control of the quality of mixtures produced. The challenge of sourcing severely aged RAPs required for this study afforded the opportunity of developing a laboratory ageing protocol for producing RAPs with controlled properties, typical of those found in hot tropical belts (with residual binders of very low penetration). The result of the physico-chemical and rheological studies showed that ageing hot mix asphalt at 125 ⁰C does not degrade the binder when compared to that aged at 85 ⁰C, which is the conventional protocol (for temperate climates). A target mix design based on Overseas Road Notes (ORN) 19 and 31 for 20 mm DBM, which the literature suggests is suitable for road base layers of road pavements, yielded an aggregate gradation containing RAP (with residual bitumen of 20 dmm penetration), 5 mm granite dust and granite mineral filler in the proportion 65 : 30 : 5 respectively. Further investigations patterned after Marshall and <b>Hveem</b> mix design <b>methods,</b> indicated that a cationic bitumen emulsion content of 6. 5 % and pre-wetting water content of 1. 5 % were suitable. Unlike hot mixtures, cold mixtures due to their peculiarity i. e. intermediate nature (close to unbound granular materials in early life and close to fully bound materials when fully cured), require curing before being assessed for mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength etc. Performances of the five cold bituminous emulsions mixtures (CBEMs), one with 100 % virgin aggregate, the others including RAP with binder penetrations 5, 10, 15 and 20 dmm, manufactured at 20 ⁰C and 32 ⁰C (to reflect average minimum and maximum temperatures in hot tropical climates) showed that: • Properties of CBEM are dependent on the state of curing or maturation attained i. e. early life, intermediate life and fully cured or stable condition; • High air void content in CBEMs appears to be inevitable; • Mixing and compaction temperature is very important for achieving relatively low air void contents in CBEMs. For example, mixing and compacting CBEMs at 32 ⁰C gave better results than at 20 ⁰C; • Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus is useful for quickly ranking the CBEMs; • The RAP CBEMs performed better than the virgin aggregate CBEM in terms of water susceptibility; • An increase in stiffness modulus up the range from 10 dmmCBEM to 15 dmmCBEM and to 20 dmmCBEM, with higher values than the virgin aggregate CBEM as observed in this work gives the impression that the residual binder in the studied RAPs is active as a result of possible softening or rejuvenation. Alternatively, the stiffness enhancements could possibly have been caused by the alteration of the volumetrics of such RAP CBEMs which consequently enhanced their compactability; • Overall, RAP CBEMs are better than virgin aggregate CBEM in mechanical performance and durability; • Fatigue lives of the CBEMs are generally lower than those for hot mix asphalt (HMA); • The CBEMs are stress-dependent as they all fitted the k-Θ model. The results of the analytical pavement design showed the importance of using tools such as KENLAYER which account for the non linearity of CBEMs. Although the structural design was a hypothetical case, the results confirmed that the virgin aggregate CBEM was inferior in terms of axle loads to failure compared to the RAP CBEMs, and the RAP CBEMs were inferior to HMA. The findings of this limited investigation suggest that the studied RAP CBEMs are suitable for low volume traffic roads, an indication of the great potential of these sustainable materials when properly harnessed. In the light of this, a short and concise set of guidelines for mix design of RAP CBEMs and structural design of pavements containing such non linear materials was proposed in the thesis.

40|$|In Portugal the Marshall {{method is}} used for {{bituminous}} mixtures design. However, methods based on empirical tests, such as the Marshall method or the <b>Hveem</b> <b>method,</b> {{are known to have}} major drawbacks. It is expected that the volumetric design of bituminous mixtures will replace these methods upgrading bituminous mixture design. In the volumetric design of bituminous mixtures specimens are prepared using the gyratory compactor and their volumetric proprieties are used to determine the optimum binder content. This volumetric design is the core of the first stage, and many times the only stage, of bituminous mixture design in the USA and Australia, for instance. The definition of design values that can simulate the field behavior of the bituminous mixtures is important. However the definition of the design values has to take in account the bituminous mixtures proprieties, traffic levels, temperatures and the existing experience with the behavior of the bituminous mixtures. In this work a study was carry on the application of gyratory compactor to common Portuguese bituminous mixtures taking in account the experience of other countries, the current practice and the capability to use this equipment as a base for volumetric design. The limit values for the volumetric design parameters such as the volume of voids or the VMA are also analyzed. New possible improvements in the known design procedures are discussed. Direction lines are draw regarding the application of volumetric design to the bituminous mixtures used in Portugal...|$|E
40|$|Roads {{form the}} {{lifeline}} of any country. It {{is considered to}} be an engineered structure and the pavement is expected to serve its designed life and meet the performance criteria for better economy. Various materials constitute the different layers of the pavement and their characterization becomes important for durability. In spite of these considerations however, many factors contribute to early pavement failure and improper material characterization is just one of them. The Bituminous mix which is used for the surface and binder courses is formed as a conglomeration of the binder, graded aggregates and voids which forms a stable mixture which can resist wear and tear as well as heavy wheel loads when used in the field. The bituminous mix needs to meet the volumetric requirements to attain stability. When bitumen is mixed with aggregates in a heated condition, the binder forms a coating around the aggregate particle which is termed as Asphalt film thickness (AFT) which is not measured but calculated. Bitumen due to its visco-elastic nature should be used at the optimum and the specified temperature to provide a minimum uniform film thickness to ensure proper bonding in the Bitumen mastic. Fillers {{play a major role in}} determining the properties and the behaviour of the mixture, especially the binding and aggregate interlocking effects. The filler has the ability to increase the resistance of particle to move within the mix matrix and/or works as an active material when it interacts with the asphalt cement to change the properties of the mastic. Mineral fillers serve a dual purpose when added to asphalt mixes, the portion of the mineral filler that is finer than the thickness of the asphalt film blends with asphalt cement binder to form a mortar or mastic that contributes to improved stiffening of the mix. In the present study the film thickness was determined by <b>Hveem</b> <b>method</b> by determining the total surface area and the effect of fillers thereon is discussed. The effect of types of fillers in varying percentage, in the performance of hot-mix-asphalt is also studied. Three types of fillers namely, Hydrated lime, Ordinary Portland Cement, and Fly ash were used as fillers in the present study. Their percentage by weight of aggregates was varied as 2 %, 4 % and 6 % to study their effect on the mix prepared for BC Grade II. The optimum binder content was determined for the various fillers and moisture susceptibility of bituminous mixtures was evaluated [...] The results of film thickness determination reveals that an average film thickness of 6 μm is obtained for all fillers which is necessary for durability of the mixes. The Fatigue results show that Lime at 4 % can be used for enhanced performance and 2 % is recommended, when cement or fly ash is used as filler material...|$|E
