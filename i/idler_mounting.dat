50|$|The track ran on four double {{roadwheels}} overlapping and interleaved in {{the so-called}} Schachtellaufwerk design used by nearly all German half-tracked vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars, track tension being maintained by an <b>idler</b> wheel, <b>mounted</b> at the rear.|$|R
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An <b>idler</b> wheel, <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|R

The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An <b>idler</b> wheel, <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension.

50|$|The Type 5 Chi-Ri {{featured}} a lengthened {{version of the}} Type 4 Chi-To chassis, with eight road wheels per side instead of the seven of the Chi-To. It had the usual Japanese track arrangement with forward mounted drive sprockets and rear <b>mounted</b> <b>idlers.</b> The Type 5 Chi-Ri had sloped welded armor, with a maximum thickness of 75 mm at the front hull; 25-50 mm on the side; 50 mm on the rear and 50 mm on the turret.|$|R
2500|$|On 7 May 1942 Hitler ordered {{development}} of a simple, low-speed, half-track, load-carrying vehicle for use on the Eastern Front. Büssing-NAG was selected {{to develop a new}} [...] tractor (Zgkw. 5t neuer Art) to replace the earlier 5 tonne Sd.Kfz. 6 and [...] Sd.Kfz. 11 half-tracks, as well as the various lesser-known vehicles of the same class. Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. Like the earlier Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 10, the sWS's suspension system consisted of five double roadwheels per side, overlapping and interleaved in the [...] layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. One <b>idler</b> wheel, <b>mounted</b> at the rear end of each track unit, was used to control track tension.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{vehicle was}} {{developed}} in Canada from January 1941, the Ram tank. Like the Sherman, this developed the M3 chassis and powertrain, with a fully rotating turret. One improvement {{was the use of}} all-steel 'CDP' (Canadian Dry Pin) tracks, which although an inch narrower than the early M4 steel and rubber pad tracks, were cheaper to produce and gave better traction. Suspension units and roadwheels remained the M3 vertical volute pattern, with the <b>idler</b> above the <b>mounting</b> bracket, rather than the M4 development with the idler moved behind the mounting bracket to give more room for suspension travel. The Ram had a distinctive turret with a bolted flat-faced mantlet and the UK 6 pdr gun, with the hull machine gunner housed in a rotating turret based on the M3 'Lee' cupola, rather than the simpler ball-mount that was becoming universal for tank hull guns. Production facilities for the Ram were constructed at the Montreal Locomotive Works, with the aid of ALCO, but the large armour castings for turret and hull were supplied by General Steel Castings in the US. Greater Sherman production and availability meant that the Ram was never used in action as a gun tank, being either used for training or converted to Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the Human Powered Vehicle Frame Design senior project’s {{contributions to the}} design, manufacture, testing, and competition of the Cal Poly Human Powered Vehicle Club’s 2015 vehicle, Sweet Phoenix. The project’s guiding rules and timeline were dictated by the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC), held in April 2015. The Club sought to improve upon its previous vehicle, Aria, which suffered {{from a range of}} faults including a catastrophic structural failure at the 2014 HPVC. Largely in response to this failure, the Frame Design project’s major focus was Sweet Phoenix’s frame, from concept to manufacturing. During the design process in the Spring and Fall of 2014, several other issues were tackled in order to define the frame’s design parameters. These secondary efforts included the fairing shape, vehicle stability requirements, handling characteristics, and rider ergonomics. A handling prototype was constructed in late Fall 2014, which successfully validated the solutions to these secondary requirements before the final design was constructed. Ultimately, Sweet Phoenix’s frame is a hybrid design – a composite monocoque fairing to which several weldments are mechanically fastened. The team used extensive finite element analysis to evaluate structural properties for both of these frame subsystems during the final development stages. Sweet Phoenix was produced during the Winter quarter of 2015, with much physical help from the HPV Club members and financial support from several sponsors. The production effort was quite successful, in part thanks to two significant manufacturing improvements – sponsored out-of-house machining of the fairing tools, and a frame-to-fairing alignment jig. The vehicle’s construction quality was recognized at HPVC with a “Best Craftsmanship” award. Testing of the final vehicle revealed very low stiffness of the weldments’ fairing mounts, which was resolved by adding additional bracing locations to the fairing. In addition, the team discovered several drivetrain-related issues that were attacked with numerous attempted solutions, but were not solved prior to HPVC. The drivetrain also contributed to localized delamination of the fairing near a chain <b>idler</b> pulley <b>mount.</b> Unfortunately, these drivetrain issues resulted in several broken chains and poor performance in the acceleration-heavy Endurance Event at HPVC. On the other hand, Sweet Phoenix placed 1 st in Design and Men’s Sprint, both satisfying results for the Club, and the Frame Design project was an overall success...|$|R
