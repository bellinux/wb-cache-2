50|$|As {{director}} of the Montgomery County Maryland Office of Economic Development, Morfessis served as the lead negotiator in the redevelopment of the two primary Central Business Districts (CBDs) in Montgomery County, Maryland well before {{the opening of the}} Bethesda and Silver Spring Metro stations: Bethesda CBD and Silver Spring CBD. Redevelopment plans were created and executed in partnership with county, state, and federal agencies, and independent commissions. A major component of the redevelopment initiative was to reach out to absent landlords of older properties, and, in some cases, abandoned properties. Morfessis galvanized the private sector to work in cooperation with the county government to plan for bids for air rights development. Through her work with the Montgomery County Planning Board, {{which is part of the}} federally chartered Maryland National Parks and Planning Commission and assists in overseeing land use planning in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, sufficient density was approved to induce well-planned mixed use developments at the Bethesda and Silver Spring Metro Stations. Morfessis also attracted federal labs to locate near the Metro stations, as well as major developers from throughout the U.S. and Canada to develop office, residential, and retail at the Metro stations. As a result of the multi-year effort, major national and international developers were attracted and deals were negotiated for the construction of significant office, mixed use, retail, and hotel projects. Simultaneous initiatives were executed to attract end-users to these new projects, as well as renters and buyers for the residential components of these developments. Today, the two CBDs are vibrant downtowns, burgeoning with residents, <b>jobs,</b> <b>shoppers,</b> and tourists.|$|R
