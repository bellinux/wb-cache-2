5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. The <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the sheer}} {{intensity}} of the fighting {{and the number of}} Indonesian troops, final casualty numbers are placed at a surprisingly low 2 killed and 8 wounded on the British side. The British in turn inflicted at least 30 casualties upon the Indonesians, but an <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the Turkish 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments lost around 2,000 men, or fifty per cent of their combined strength. The full number of Turkish casualties for the day has not been recorded. During the campaign, 8,708 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders were killed.

In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer.

5|$|The <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> {{of cases}} of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown.

Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> of French {{prisoners who}} escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, {{it has been}} {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> {{of churches}} {{that existed in}} Visby during the Middle Ages is unknown, there were {{certainly}} more {{than in any other}} Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E
