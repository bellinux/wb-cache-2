5|$|In late July 1943, No.1 Wing's {{headquarters}} was disbanded to make {{it easier}} to deploy the Spitfire squadrons to different areas as the need arose. Under the new command arrangements, the squadrons reported directly to the North-Western Area's headquarters for administrative purposes and No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters controlled all fighter operations. This change also aimed to end the confusion which existed at the time between whether the wing leader or senior <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> in the fighter sector headquarters was responsible for directing the Spitfires during battle. No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was redesignated No.1 Wing on 25September when Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey assumed command from Caldwell, who had been appointed No.2 Operational Training Unit's chief flying instructor. The headquarters' role remained unchanged.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no further}} {{communication}} between Flight 954 and the <b>ground</b> <b>controller.</b> This left the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> {{with the assumption}} that Flight 954 was holding at the 32R run-up pad and in no danger of conflicting with other traffic and the flight crew {{with the assumption that}} they were cleared to taxi to the 32L run-up pad and could cross Runway 27L without danger of a collision with aircraft using that runway. Moreover, Flight 954's flight crew had never received word that Runway 27L was an active runway, and had no reason to anticipate encountering other aircraft while taxiing across it.|$|E
25|$|Y-Gerät an {{automatic}} beam-tracking {{system and the}} most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a <b>ground</b> <b>controller.</b> Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to precisely be measured. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a code word from the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> or {{at the conclusion of}} the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of Y-Gerät was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.|$|E

25|$|The flight {{controller}} and approach controller were experienced professionals {{with at least}} 10 years of service. The <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> on duty, who was 23 years old, was new. He supposedly had not had enough sleep {{in the days before}} the accident, having had to care for his two young children.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} its {{report on the}} accident on July 5, 1973. It found that the probable cause of the accident was {{the failure of the}} traffic control system to ensure adequate aircraft separation during a period of limited visibility. It noted that non-standard terminology – used to expedite traffic flow – was common in communications between controllers and aircrews at O'Hare International Airport and included the omission of words, altered phraseology, and use of colloquialisms. It found that the lack of clarity of wording {{on the part of the}} <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> in his communications with Delta Flight 954 and the Delta crew's failure to request confirmation that their taxiing intentions matched those understood by the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> were the major causes of the accident. As a result, the controller was confused as to the location of the Convair CV-880, and neither the controller nor its flight crew realized that they were referring to different run-up pads as the holding area for Delta Flight 954.|$|E
25|$|A State {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> was found directly responsible, as he fell asleep on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.|$|E

25|$|On 5 July, the 339th Squadron {{was pulled}} out of combat and {{returned}} to Johnson AB. Shortly afterwards, the 4th Squadron returned to Okinawa, with the 347th Provisional Group being inactivated {{and control of the}} 68th Squadron being turned over to the 8th Fighter Group. The 339th had been in combat a total of 10 days (26 June–5 July), flying a total of 44 combat sorties for which they had been given no training. The 68th Squadron was left to carry on the battle. Throughout July and August 1950, F-82s from the 68th Squadron attacked enemy trains, vehicles, and numerous buildings, and constantly strafed North Korean troops on the roads. On the night of 27 August, an element of F-82s was patrolling over South Korea over a thick overcast when they received an urgent request for air support from some hard-pressed ground troops. Darkness was approaching when they reached the area and found UN ground troops pinned down by a concentration of mortars. The F-82 pilots made several passes to get set up with the <b>ground</b> <b>controller,</b> {{and as soon as the}} enemy target was pinpointed, the heavily armed aircraft commenced an attack that would last 45 minutes and use up all their ordnance. When the aircraft pulled up for the last time, the mortar positions were silent and ground forces later showed over 300 enemy dead.|$|E
2500|$|Around 5:36 am, Flight 3352 {{requested}} {{permission to}} {{land from the}} approach controller. The request was sent twice; the pilots noticed vague contours on the runway and wanted to double check for obstacles. The controller verified the runway status, which remained apparently unoccupied, then contacted the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> and received no response, and subsequently contacted the flight controller on internal radio and received an inaudible reply that sounded like [...] "..ree" [...] (original, [...] ) and was taken as [...] "free" [...] ( [...] ; communications were being taped and were analyzed later). The approach controller cleared the landing, though unable to see the runway, {{and in spite of}} regulations that required him to keep the flight in the air and double check the runway's status. Both the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> and secondary controller {{should have been able to}} see the runway, but the former was asleep, and the latter was absent due to staff shortages.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> did {{not hear}} the words [...] "inside the bridge," [...] and, {{assuming}} Flight 954 had just left the end of Runway 14L and was still well north of the bridge, ambiguously instructed it to hold in the [...] "thirty-two box", meaning in the controller's mind the 32R run-up pad at the southeast end of Runway 14L, where he assumed the plane to be. To reach the 32R run-up pad, Flight 954 {{would have had to}} turn around and return to the end of Runway 14L, where it had just landed, taxiing against the flow of traffic; instead, Flight 954's captain and first officer both assumed that the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> understood that they were [...] "inside the bridge" [...] and was referring to the 32L run-up pad, which was located at the southeast end of Runway 14R, {{on the other side of}} the terminal from the 32R run-up pad. Assuming that they were cleared to taxi to the 32L pad, they proceeded toward it using the Bridge, Outer Circular, and North–South taxiways, via a route that intersected with Runway 27L.|$|E

He called on the <b>Ground</b> <b>Controller</b> to [...] "lock the doors", meaning {{no one would be}} permitted to enter or leave until everything needed for investigation of the accident had been secured. Two minutes later, Mission Control put contingency procedures into effect.|$|E
2500|$|At 5:20 am, {{worried that}} the {{continuing}} rain would make the runway overly slippery, the airport ground maintenance crew requested permission to dry the runway. The <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> on duty gave permission and proceeded to fall asleep soon after, in the process forgetting to switch on the [...] "runway occupied" [...] warning. In any case, under airport regulations, this whole procedure should never have happened; permission to close and do maintenance on a runway could only be given by the chief controller, and he was absent.|$|E

5000|$|... "Ground Controlled Interception", or [...] "GCI", {{was a major}} {{function}} of the base, providing air force personnel in a ground station, like a radar site or an air defence command and control centre with the systems to guide fighters to intercept an aircraft. The ground control is done by radio. The usual method is the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> and the interceptor's aircrew talk to each other. In the past, on occasion — such as with the CF-101 Voodoo interceptor — the information could sometimes be transmitted to the fighter by datalink. Datalink sends information to the fighter's crew by the press of a button at a console in the ground station rather than a controller speaking to the aircrew, loosely similar to how WiFi sends data to computers today. Datalink has the advantage that, since no words are spoken, an enemy can't eavesdrop into the radio frequency {{and listen to what}} the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> and aircrew are doing and planning. Despite this advantage, the majority of GCI practiced by air forces around the world was (and still is) done by the <b>ground</b> <b>controller</b> and the aircrew talking over the radio.|$|E
