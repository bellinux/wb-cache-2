(Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' <b>homework</b> <b>and</b> studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread.

5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} be able to do so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering.

Baseline data was collected and compared to rates of <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> the percentage of accuracy over a three-week intervention period. In addition to determining if these technologies had any effect on <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> accuracy, the researcher wanted to determine if parents would utilize the communications strategies if they were made available.

40|$|Computer {{architecture}} and programming are disciplines that require extensive experimentation with computer tools, such as simulators and compilers. At the authors' universities, several tools are being incorporated in {{courses at the}} junior and senior levels by using a powerful, web-based network-computing system as a computational and educational resource. The educational content includes examples, manuals, <b>homeworks</b> <b>and</b> other related information.

The result {{is a system that}} supports the integration {{of a large number of}} tools in undergraduate classes. The system is publicly accessible and, upon request, available for use by other universities and educators. This paper describes the existing system, discusses examples of tool-integration in existing classes and reviews the current status of the project.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that there is a correlation between <b>homework</b> performance <b>and</b> academic achievement. Students with higher rates of <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> accuracy also tend to do well academically. Researchers have examined the efficacy of group contingencies to improve <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> accuracy in self-contained classrooms and with individuals who experienced difficulties with homework. Group contingencies have been effective in addressing homework problems for individual students as well as those in special education settings. To this point, however, few researchers have considered implementing group contingencies to improve homework production in general education classrooms. Teachers have reported that their students do not accomplish as much homework as they are capable of. The goal of the current study was to extend previous research {{through the use of a}} single-subject research design with 3 middle school general education math classrooms. The use of dependent group contingencies should improve students 2 ̆ 7 <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> accuracy. Teachers used a reinforcement system based on dependent group contingencies to improve their classrooms 2 ̆ 7 <b>homework</b> completion <b>and</b> accuracy. Results were mixed amongst the three classrooms.

25|$|As {{of school}} year 2009-2010, full-day classes (celodnevna nastava) are held. They are {{designed}} for children with busy parents. They are organized only for lower grades of primary schools. Children have morning classes, afternoon classes and breaks for play, homework, lunch etc. They have separate teachers for separate shifts. This gives students possibility to be in school for the longest {{part of the day}} with their classmates and do all the <b>homework</b> <b>and</b> other school obligations at school.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{subjects}} in the high convergent thinking group illustrated higher grade averages for the previous school year, less difficulty with <b>homework</b> <b>and</b> also indicated that their parents pressed them towards post-secondary education. These were the only significant relationships regarding the convergent thinking measures. This suggests that these cognitive dimensions are independent of one another. Future investigations into this topic should focus more upon the developmental, cognitive and perpetual aspects of personality among divergent and convergent thinkers, rather than their attitude structures.|$|E
25|$|Children {{also take}} {{initiative}} {{to help others}} in the classroom. It has been observed that when children are working in a group with their peers and face difficulty, they will scan the room for an adult to assist or turn to their close fellows to either ask for help. Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found {{to take the initiative}} to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, <b>homework,</b> <b>and</b> caring for younger siblings.|$|E
