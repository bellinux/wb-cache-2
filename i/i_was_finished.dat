[...] Ransom was not brazen, he was not impudent, he was really a very modest man; but {{he was aware that}} {{whatever}} he said or did he was condemned to seem impudent now, and he argued within himself that if he was to have the dishonour of being thought brazen {{he might as well have}} the comfort.
