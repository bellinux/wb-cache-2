40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers {{affecting}} women in Ireland with approximately 1, 726 women being registered with breast cancer each year (National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI), 2005). The majority of women with breast cancer have surgery as a form of treatment either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy (NCRI, 2005). An integral part of the recovery post surgery involves considering restorative options. For many women in Ireland this means being fitted with an external breast prosthesis. Currently, there are an estimated 16, 000 women in Ireland who have undergone a mastectomy and require an external breast prosthesis. The overall purpose of this research is to gain an insight into women’s experience of the provision, fitting, supply and use of <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> in Ireland...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} malignant disease in women. The loss of a breast is a highly traumatizing event for the woman; thus, surgical or non-surgical methods of reconstruction can improve quality of life. In the present study, we aimed to assess patient satisfaction with two different models of adhesive <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and to compare them with the previously worn models. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 240 women {{using one of the}} two prosthesis models. 154 questionnaires were returned, 41 of which were not eligible for evaluation. Most items were rated on a verbal scale (VRS). Results: After a prosthesis-free period of about 4. 5 years, the women wore both models of the “Silima direct” for almost 2 years. The assessment of both models was mainly positive. The average VRS scores were just above 2 out of 5 points, which corresponds to a “good” rating. The lighter model scored better results. Of the patients, 73. 6 % were overall at least “satisfied” with the lighter model as compared to 58. 3 % with the model of normal weight. In comparison with the Amoena adhesive epithesis and other prosthesis models worn previously, the “Silima direct” and particularly the light model was perceived to be better in almost all criteria. Conclusion: <b>External</b> adhesive <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> are a valuable method of post-mastectomy rehabilitation, which improves quality of life...|$|R

Preference was independent of age, randomization order, or the possible use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Satisfaction with the self-adhesive prosthesis was independent of randomization order but satisfaction with the traditional type was significantly more when it was the first type of prosthesis. Preference for the self-adhesive prosthesis over the traditional type was mainly related to an increased perception of vhe prosthesis {{as a part of the}} body. Preference for the traditional prosthesis over the other type was mainly related to the greater ease of application and the lesser local irritation of the skin.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and analyse the factors which influence utilization of EBPs among breast cancer patients worldwide and particularly in China. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in Wanfang, CNKI, and PubMed databses in order to identify relevant articles published in both Chinese and English up to October 2014. The phrase “external breast prosthesis” in Chinese was used to search titles, abstracts, and key words to find articles in Wanfang and CNKI electronic databases. Synonyms and related terms for <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> were combined and used for searches performed in PubMed. Additional references were subsequently extracted from the bibliographies of all included articles and reviews. Qualitative analysis was applied in this study rather than meta-analysis. Results: The number of relevant studies published in other countries is five times greater than the literature published in China, with most articles written by Australian scientists. Based on the existing references, reconstruction, comfort, appearance, cost, mental status, and supportive information were the main factors influencing choice of treatment options by patients. Conclusion: Six main factors influencing EBP use worldwide were identified. Although the number of breast cancer cases per year is increasing at a much higher rate in China relative to the average number globally, relevant studies on Chinese patients are lacking. Thus, further studies should be undertaken in China in order to develop effective service modalities in order to improve quality of life of patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Recent papers {{indicate}} that one-side mastectomy can produce deleterious {{effects on the}} posture and musculoskeletal system. This {{study was conducted to}} better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in trunk motion in external prosthesis users. Objective. The aim was to evaluate the changes in surface electromyographic (SEMG) activity of the erector spinae muscles (ES) in postmastectomy women with and without breast prostheses during functional body movement tests. Methods. In 51 one-side postmastectomy women the SEMG muscle activity of bilateral ES was measured during symmetrical and asymmetrical dynamic activities in a counterbalanced manner with different weights of the breast prosthesis. Range-of-motion measurements were taken for forward bending, backward bending, lateral bending, and rotation. Results. The mean level of the ES activity in the lumbar region was not affected by the weight of the external breast prosthesis during most of the functional body tests (P> 0. 05). The activity of ES during functional body tests with and without different <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> did not differ between {{the two sides of the}} trunk (mastectomy and nonmastectomy) for most of the movement tests (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{experiences}} of the use of <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> among breast cancer survivors in Korea. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, using focus groups. Data were collected from breast cancer survivors who were patients of C women's hospital in Seoul, Korea. Data were analyzed using content analysis in order to identify significant themes. Results: Participants included forty breast cancer survivors who had mastectomy as a surgical treatment. Four themes emerged from the collected data were: 1) concern over the high price of external breast prosthesis, 2) irregular use of external breast prosthesis, 3) unsatisfied with mastectomy bra, and 4) wanting to hide or not to talk about using breast prosthesis openly. Conclusion: Since most participants reported irregular use and negative experiences related to external breast prosthesis or mastectomy bra use, healthcare workers should allow more time for proper fitting and counseling and consulting with breast cancer survivors. In addition, health care providers as well as family and friends should keep in mind that cancer survivors need support that can help them cope by using positive reframing.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the experiences of breast cancer patients using <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> (EBP) in the context of the Pakistani society. Methods: A qualitative descriptive exploratory design was used in the study. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 15 postmastectomy women using EBP. A semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions was used for the interviews. The analysis of the data was organized into four categories according to the study questions including reasons for using EBP, feeling about EBP, challenges for using EBP, and coping with lost breast. Each category was further divided into subcategories. Results: Women used EBP because they felt strange, incomplete, and embarrassed in front of other people, due to the asymmetrical shape of the chest after mastectomy. They faced several challenges with regard to obtaining and using the EBP. While EBP was used as an alternative of their lost breast, they experienced sadness and embarrassment. They found it challenging to take care of the EBP and were required to make changes in their lifestyle. However, they accepted living with their lost breast, either through rationalization, family support, or faith and prayers, which helped them to cope. Conclusions: The study findings have given insight into some real experiences of mastectomy patients. Mastectomy not only affects women 2 ̆ 7 s physical health but also their psychological health, as a result of which they become reluctant to socialize. Using EBP can help them to improve their body image and body posture. Health-care providers 2 ̆ 7 support is very important to the families of the patients specifically where patients are very shy to openly seek information due to cultural constraints...|$|E
40|$|Mulheres submetidas à mastectomia, apresentam assimetrias posturais, assim como alterações na cinemática do movimento do ombro e tronco. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o equilíbrio estático bem como a marcha em mulheres submetidas à cirurgia de mastectomia {{unilateral}}. Para tanto, foram analisadas 42 mulheres, divididas em dois grupos: mulheres submetidas à mastectomia unilateral (GM), com idade média de 53, 77 ± 7, 24 anos, e mulheres sem a doença como controle (GC), com idade média de 54, 70 ± 6, 31 anos. As análises do equilíbrio estático e da marcha foram efetuadas com sistema Vicon System (VICON-MX-T 40 S, Oxford, Inglaterra). Foi avaliado o equilíbrio estático com olhos abertos e olhos fechados, com e sem o uso da prótese mamária externa, por meio da área e do deslocamento do centro de massa projetado no chão, assim como o ângulo da coluna. Na marcha, foram avaliados os parâmetros espaço-temporal com e sem o uso da prótese mamária externa, e a oscilação dos membros superiores e do tronco. Foi aplicado o teste de normalidade de Shapiro-Wilk, diante de uma distribuição normal e relacionada, aplicou-se o teste T relacionado, e para amostras independentes, teste T independente, em distribuição não paramétrica, foi aplicado Wilcoxon para variáveis relacionadas e Mann-Whitney, para variáveis independentes. Foi fixado o nível crítico de 5 % (p< 0, 05), o processamento dos dados efetuado pelo software SPSS, versão 17. 0. A análise do equilíbrio estático apontou aumento significativo na área e no deslocamento do centro de massa projetado no chão, e deslocamento médio-lateral do ângulo da coluna. Na marcha, houve piora dos parâmetros espaço-temporal e menor oscilção do membro superior homolateral à cirurgia para movimentos de flexão/extensão e abdução/adução, o tronco apresentou menor oscilação médio-lateral. A prótese parece não ter influenciado no equilíbrio e na marcha. Os resultados sugerem que a mastectomia unilateral pode afetar o equilíbrio e a marcha. Women undergoing mastectomy, have postural asymmetries {{as well as}} {{changes in}} the kinematics of {{the movement of the}} shoulder and spine. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate static balance and gait in women undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery. Therefore, 42 women were analyzed, divided into two groups: women who underwent unilateral mastectomy (GM) with a mean age of 53. 77 ± 7. 24 years, and women without the disease as control (GC) with a mean age of 54. 70 ± 6. 31 years. Analyses of static equilibrium and gait was performed with Vicon System (MX-T 40 S-VICON, Oxford, England). We evaluated the static balance with eyes open and eyes closed, with and without the use of <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> through the area and the center of mass displacement designed on the floor, as well as the angle of the spine. On the gait were evaluated spatiotemporal parameters with and without the use of <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and the oscillation of the upper limbs and trunk during walking. The functionality of the upper limbs was measured by the DASH questionnaire, and the level of physical activity by IPAQ. We used the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, before a normal and related distribution, we applied the related t test for independent samples and, independent t test, in non-parametric distribution, Wilcoxon was applied to related variables and Mann Whitney test for independent variables was set the critical level of 5 % (p < 0. 05), the processing of data carried out by SPSS software, version 17. 0. The static equilibrium analysis indicated a significant increase in the area and the center of mass offset projected on the ground and the medial-lateral displacement of the spine angle. On the march, there was worsening of spatiotemporal parameters and lower swing in arm ipsilateral to surgery for flexion/extension and abduction/adduction, trunk shows less medial-lateral oscillation.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 M ITC 2017 Leungxx, 213 pages :color illustrationsIn Hong Kong, breast cancer, {{one of the}} {{top three}} fatal cancers, has become the most common cancer {{affecting}} women. The incidence rate in Hong Kong has been rising substantially and the age of breast cancer diagnosis has become increasingly younger. Though most breast cancer patients have managed to survive mastectomy, and up to 90 % of them use <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses,</b> there have been limited choice for mastectomy patients in terms of prostheses and mastectomy bras. Since the design and development of mastectomy bras and prostheses are largely Western-centric, Asian breast cancer patients (e. g. Hong Kong patients) often have difficulty finding good-fitting prostheses and mastectomy bras, which has led to many physiological and psychological health problems. For example, heat build-up, one of the most commonly reported issues with post-mastectomy products, has persistently created discomfort for mastectomy patients despite a wide range of products available in the market. Those products are claimed to solve the heat build-up problem; however, without proper scientific performance evaluation, some of them actually give additional confusion and stress to mastectomy patients who have already suffered quite a lot from post-mastectomy trauma. This study aims to identify the prosthetic needs of Hong Kong mastectomized women and to create a design solution to enhance patients' satisfaction and quality of life by using 3 D-based design technologies. A set of heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bras and breast prostheses was created based on the survey results of 200 local mastectomized ladies. The performances of the heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bras and breast prostheses were evaluated {{with the help of a}} clothing comfort evaluation experiment utilizing skin temperature (°C), humidity (RH%) and core body temperature (Tcore). A commonly used conventional mastectomy bra was used as a control sample against the suggested solution of this study. A 90 -min wear trial was conducted inside a controlled chamber at a temperature of 25 ºC and a relative humidity of 70 %. 9 participants were invited to perform five daily activities including sitting, walking at 5 km/h, running at 8 km/h, slow walking/cooling down at 3 km/h, and sitting in experiment attire designed to minimize experimental errors, consisting of a conventional mastectomy bra and prosthesis, a heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bra and prosthesis, a brief, a tracksuit top and a pair of running shorts. Evaluation results demonstrated that when the participants wore the heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bra and prosthesis, their chest skin temperature, core body temperature, and humidity inside the bra were 0. 2 - 1. 7 ºC (p< 0. 05), 0. 1 ± 0. 2 ºC to 0. 2 ± 0. 5 ºC (p< 0. 05), and 3 - 12 % (p< 0. 05) respectively, all of which were lower than those of the conventional mastectomy bra and prosthesis. Thus, the heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bra and prosthesis yielded higher scores in sensitive sensations such as dry, non-adhesive, breathable, light and cool, providing more clothing comfort for the participants. In conclusion, the heat-and-moisture reduction mastectomy bra and prosthesis created in this study could provide better clothing comfort for mastectomy patients by solving the heat build-up problem whilst the protocol of the wear trial experiment presented in this study could be implemented as a scientific performance evaluation method for post-mastectomy products.

40|$|Women {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and who have the disease surgically treated by mastectomy experience a health crisis. This thesis focused on the behaviours, feelings and attitudes of women during their breast cancer and mastectomy experiences. The overall purpose was to identify therapeutic factors that can be used by health professionals to improve the psychological and physiological well-being of women with this disease. The conceptual scaffolding for the thesis was drawn from the fields of perceptual psychology and decision-making. The thesis was supported by a study that examined specific areas concerning the breast cancer and mastectomy experience. These areas were self-perceptions, the psychological milieu resulting from a breast cancer diagnosis, and post-mastectomy breast restoration decision-making. The population included: a prosthesis group of 64 women who had mastectomies and wore <b>external</b> <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses,</b> a reconstruction group of 31 women who had mastectomies and underwent breast reconstructions, a control A group of 75 women who had not experienced mastectomy, and a control B group of 65 women who also had not experienced mastectomy. Self-perceptions: The perceptions of the prosthesis, reconstruction and control A groups regarding their body-image, self-concept, total self-image, and self-esteem were compared by using Polivy's (1977) Body-Image Scale and Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale. The body-image, total self-image, and self-esteem mean scores indicated that the prosthesis and reconstruction groups had more positive feelings regarding their bodies than did the control group. There {{were no significant differences in}} self-concept among the three groups. These findings challenge a common assumption that mastectomy automatically results in psychiatric morbidity caused by an altered body-image and suggest that health professionals should not make assumptions about how a woman will psychologically respond to mastectomy. Quality of life perceptions were compared among the prosthesis, reconstruction and control B groups using the Ferrans and Powers (1985) Quality of Life Index. The mean scores of the prosthesis and reconstruction groups were higher than the control group's scores, with higher scores indicating more positive quality of life perceptions. The findings suggest that the women in the mastectomy samples had found ways to cope with their health crises. Over time, they learned not to define all existence in terms of a cancer diagnosis and had gained or maintained a positive perspective on life. Post-mastectomy attitudes in the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were compared. Using the Mastectomy Attitude Scale the results indicated that both groups were satisfied with their bodies, had a positive outlook towards their lives, implied that sexuality entailed more than having breasts, and felt that mastectomy treatment was necessary to save their lives. Neither group concealed that they had a mastectomy, nor were the women prone to discuss their mastectomy experiences. The findings from the study indicate that the women post-mastectomy already had or developed positive attitudes towards themselves and life in general and the method chosen for breast restoration had no apparent impact on these attitudes. The self-perception data indicated that women do adjust and cope with breast cancer surgically treated by mastectomy. These women should be encouraged by health professionals to develop a helping relationship with other women who are newly {{diagnosed with}} the disease. This alliance could engender hope in those women who are beginning their journey along a similar road to survival. More hope for these women and less fatalism would decrease their sense of crisis and facilitate their abilities to take an active part in the decision-making processes relating to their treatment. Psychological Milieu: The women in the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were interviewed about their breast cancer and mastectomy experiences. The findings supported the premise that receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer plunged the women into a health crisis and caused an instant disruption to their lives. The women found that they had to suddenly deal with several complex issues all at the same time, such as what must be done in the immediate future to treat the cancer, as well as the more frightening issues of the meaning of the illness on their ultimate life expectancy. All of this turmoil played havoc with their ability to make informed decisions regarding their breast cancer treatment alternatives. This finding suggests the need for more individualised interventions and support for women when they are making decisions during this stressful period. Health professionals need to keep in mind that simply hearing the word "cancer" often prevents a person from assimilating the complete diagnosis, indicated treatments, and possible prognosis. Therefore, care-givers must be prepared to repeat and elaborate upon information previously given to the affected individual and the family. Breast Restoration Decision-Making: To evaluate the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups' abilities to undertake competent breast restoration decision-making, a 5 Stage process was devised, modelled after Janis and Mann's (1977) seven criteria for competent decision-making. Analysis of the data revealed that both groups displayed passive information seeking behaviour in relation to breast restoration alternatives. They had either no knowledge or limited knowledge regarding the alternatives. Their lack of knowledge was due either to (1) anxiety about their disease, or (2) deficiencies in the interpersonal skills of individuals presenting information to them, or (3) the perceptions that they had insufficient time to gather information, or (4) a combination of these factors. Because the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were under stress they used coping styles to accomplish decision-making. To measure their coping styles five categories were defined, based on Janis and Mann's (1977) conflict model of emergency decisionmaking and Simon's (1957) notion of "bounded rationality". Two styles emerged. The prosthesis group used the "Sideliner" style that allowed the women to make a quick, conflict-free decision. They were not aware of alternative choices resulting in their decision-making experience being uncomplicated and effortless. The reconstruction group used the "Contented" style that also allowed them an uncomplicated and effortless decision-making experience. The women decided that breast reconstruction was their only viable option. Many of them did not even think that they had made a decision about an alternative because of the strong salience towards breast reconstruction. A breast restoration decision-making model has been developed and proposed for women to use when considering their alternatives. This model offers to health professionals and women a realistic and useable decision-making process that can be implemented when individuals are experiencing a health crisis. The model can be modified and used for numerous situations that require decisions regarding treatment alternatives. This inquiry has demonstrated that there is a need for a specific health professional to assist women newly {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. This individual would assume several roles that include one of advocacy for the women, and the important role of ensuring that these individuals have the information and knowledge to make competent decisions regarding their breast cancer treatments...|$|E

The aetiology of capsular contraction is unclear, {{but may be}} due to infection, haematoma or foreign body-type reactions...|$|R

25|$|Part B {{also helps}} with durable medical {{equipment}} (DME), including canes, walkers, lift chairs, wheelchairs, and mobility scooters {{for those with}} mobility impairments. Prosthetic devices such as artificial limbs and <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> following mastectomy, {{as well as one}} pair of eyeglasses following cataract surgery, and oxygen for home use is also covered.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the tumor}} has been removed, {{if the patient}} desires, breast {{reconstruction}} surgery, a type of plastic surgery, may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.Alternatively, women use <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. Nipple prosthesis can be used at any time following the mastectomy.|$|R
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{advantage of}} the free-flap breast reconstruction procedure is avoidance of the medical complications—infection, malposition of the breast implant(s), capsular contracture—which occasionally occur consequent to breast-reconstruction surgery procedures that emplace <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> to the mastectomy wounds. In which cases, the correction of such medical complications might surgically require either the revision (rearrangement) or the explantation (removal) of the breast implants.|$|R
25|$|The modern {{prosthetic}} breast {{was invented}} in 1961, by the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and manufactured by the Dow Corning Corporation; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962. There are five generations of medical device technology for the breast-implant models filled with silicone gel; each generation of <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is defined by common model-manufacturing techniques.|$|R
