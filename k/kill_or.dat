5|$|In {{the letter}} column of <b>Kill</b> <b>or</b> Be Killed #12 (September 2017), Brubaker {{mentioned}} {{plans for a}} semi-sequel to The Fade Out. He said that if made, the comic book would share the setting {{and some of the}} supporting characters, but the plot would be unrelated.|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5000|$|The city of Portsmouth [...] "gave 1,242 {{men to the}} Confederacy of whom 199 were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> died; Norfolk County gave 1,018 men to {{the cause}} of whom 280 were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> died; and the City of Norfolk gave 1,119 of whom 176 were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> died." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{report of}} the U.K. War Office listed {{military}} casualties of 335,706 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing. In addition 265,000 civilians were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing.|$|R
25|$|Between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> {{wounded in}} the brief battle. In contrast, only about 300 {{government}} soldiers were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|R
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{the five}} types of living beings, a householder is {{forbidden}} to <b>kill,</b> <b>or</b> destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life {{to the best of}} his ability.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Seventh Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured), {{while the}} British Eighth Army {{suffered}} 11,843 casualties (2,062 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing, 7,137 wounded and 2,644 captured). The U.S. Navy lost 546 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing and 484 wounded and the Royal Navy lost 314 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> missing, 411 wounded and four captured. The USAAF reported 28 killed, 88 missing and 41 wounded. Canadian forces had suffered 2,310 casualties, including 562 killed, 1,664 wounded, and 84 captured.|$|R
50|$|The French lost 250 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded, plus 78 captured, {{mostly from}} the 4th and 20th Dragoons. The British only lost 20 troopers <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|R
25|$|The French lost 53 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded, plus 136 {{captured}} (including 4 officers - one a lt. colonel) {{and were}} induced {{to leave the}} province of Extremadura. The British lost 51 troopers <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|R
5|$|Venom in {{snakes and}} some lizards {{is a form}} of saliva that has been {{modified}} into venom over its evolutionary history. In snakes, venom has evolved to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> subdue prey, as well as to perform other diet-related functions. The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{conquest of}} the Philippines by Japan is often {{considered}} the worst military defeat in United States history. Twenty-three thousand American military personnel were <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> captured and Filipino soldiers <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> captured totaled around 100,000.|$|R
5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded on the 7th and 20 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|R
5000|$|In 4 days of combat, the {{regiment}} endured heavy losses while affecting particularly the command corps: both battalion commanders Burel and Declève were <b>killed</b> (<b>or</b> disappeared) and 6 out 8 combat companies lost their Commandants. Total losses for {{the regiment}} were 951 men ( [...] Officers : 12 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> disappeared, 17 wounded - 922 men <b>killed,</b> disappeared <b>or</b> wounded [...] ).|$|R
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E
50|$|The Portuguese and British were {{severely}} defeated, {{with the}} loss of about 1,700 men <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded, about 2,300 prisoners, 17 cannon, 15 colours or standards, as well as tents, and baggage. The Spaniards having had about 400 men, and 100 horses, <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|R
50|$|If {{no one is}} <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> hurt, and the {{prosecutor}} is proceeding by summary conviction, the maximum sentence is 18 months of jail. If no one is <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> hurt, and {{the prosecutor}} is proceeding by indictment, the maximum sentence is 5 years of jail.|$|R
5000|$|... “′Harm′ in the {{definition}} of `take′ in the Act means an act which actually <b>kills</b> <b>or</b> injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually <b>kills</b> <b>or</b> injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.” ...|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 21/22 October 1944, Private Ernest Alvia ("Smokey") Smith used a PIAT to destroy a German Mark V Panther tank, one of three Panthers and two {{self-propelled}} guns attacking his small group. The self-propelled vehicles were also knocked out. He then used a Thompson submachine gun to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> repel about 30 enemy soldiers. His actions secured a bridgehead on the Savio River in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{chooses to}} be kept in the dark {{about the future of the}} series, never knowing any farther ahead than his current working script. For <b>Kill</b> <b>or</b> Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used on {{previous}} works, but removed the frame from the outside edges because he felt the full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an integral part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> subdue prey, {{as well as}} for other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E

25|$|In his 2009 book, Combattre pour la France en Amérique, Marcel Fournier diverges {{considerably}} {{from the other}} sources in reporting the casualties for the Battle of Lac St-Sacrement (as the French called it) at 800 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded for the British and 200 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded for the French.|$|R
50|$|Unconfirmed reports {{indicated}} that the convoy suffered casualties including several GNA soldiers captured <b>or</b> <b>killed,</b> and several Italian marines <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|R
5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle was}} a major victory for the Royal Navy. Despite being outnumbered, it {{captured}} four Spanish ships and crippled seven, including the largest warship afloat at that time - the Santísima Trinidad. Britain lost approximately 300 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded; the Spanish lost 1,092 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded, and 2,300 taken prisoner.|$|R
