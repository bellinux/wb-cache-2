5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, {{and uses the}} machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E

25|$|Kicking {{with the}} wind in the third quarter, North Hobart took full advantage. After an early goal to Wynyard, the Robins {{dominated}} and regained the lead after fifteen minutes. Devine continued to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> open space around the ground, and was very damaging, scoring two goals himself and assisting on three more for the quarter. Dell and Cox were again good in defence for Wynyard – although the Cats twice conceded bouncing goals after leaving the goal square unguarded. North Hobart scored 6.6 (42) to Wynyard's 1.2 (8) in the third quarter, and led by 14 points at three-quarter time: 11.17 (83) to 10.9 (69).|$|E
25|$|When Fernando I was born, in 1403, his grandfather, Nuno Álvares Pereira, ceded him {{the title}} of Count of Arraiolos. Fernando became an {{accomplished}} military man, participating in various Portuguese imperial campaigns. Though Fernando I was a popular and powerful member of the nobility, he did not always <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the favour of the king, most notably exemplified when Fernando I openly declaimed King Duarte I, at the Portuguese Cortes, {{on the topic of}} the rescue and recovery of the King's brother, Infante Fernando, Lord of Salvaterra de Magos from the Moors. However, Fernando I became a favourite of both the royal and imperial government and of King Afonso V, earning him the position of Governor of Ceuta and the titles of Marquis of Vila Viçosa and Count of Neiva.|$|E

He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers {{that he is in}} a cell.

25|$|However, after 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne {{was soon}} enough to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> prison. Too closely {{associated}} with the excesses of the Reign of Terror, he was shortly attacked himself in the Convention for his ruthlessness, and a commission was appointed to examine his conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee of Public Safety. Billaud-Varenne was arrested, {{and as a result of}} the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation to French Guiana, along with Collot d'Herbois and Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac. After Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup, he refused the pardon offered by the French Consulate. In 1816 he left Guiana, went to New York City for a few months, and finally took refuge in Port-au-Prince (Haiti), where he died of dysentery.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 3 September, the brigade'was {{involved}} in a nighttime attack during which the commander of its 26th Battalion was mortally wounded. With the battalion leaderless and disorganised, Clifton tried to restore order. He approached what he thought were friendly troops only to <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{the hands of the}} Germans. Debriefed personally by the commander of the Panzer Army Africa, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, Clifton was taken away afterwards by truck but promptly jumped out to try and escape. Chased down by the guards, he was recaptured only to give them the slip again. He walked for five days to El Alamein before he was noticed by the crew of a German panzer and captured. Taken before Rommel again, he was threatened with a firing squad if he was to escape again. He was flown to Italy the next day.|$|E
25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had {{never set foot}} in any of Britain’s colonies, but the Hola massacre had helped focus his thinking on the inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often <b>find</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.|$|E
