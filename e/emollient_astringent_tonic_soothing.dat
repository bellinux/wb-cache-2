40|$|Summary : Terminalia chebula Retz. {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in traditional medicine for laxative, carminative, <b>astringent,</b> expectorant, and <b>tonic.</b> The chronic toxicity of water extract {{has not yet been}} studied. To evaluate its safety, the water extract from the dried fruits of T. chebula was orally administrated in rats. For acute toxicity, a single oral administration was performed at a dose of 5, 000 mg/kg body weight (five females, five males). The study of chronic toxicity was determined by oral feeding both female and male rats (ten females, ten males) daily with the test substance at the dose of 300, 600 and 1, 200 mg/kg body weight continuously for 270 days. The results of acute toxicity showed no signs of toxicity such as general behavior changes, mortality, changes on gross appearance or histophatological changes of the internal organs of rats. The examinations of signs of chronic toxicity showed no abnormalities in the test groups as compared to the controls. Hematological and blood chemical values in treated groups were normal in comparison with the control group. Non-toxicity effect of T. chebula was present as no changes in body weight, internal organ weight, and general behaviors. Macroscopic or microscopic of internal organs or tissues in treated rats showed no changes. Therefore, the water extract of T. chebula given orally to female and male rats did not produce both acute and chronic toxicities in rats. Industrial relevance: The use of medicinal plants and preparations derived from them as dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, functional foods and herbal medicinal products has become more widely accepted in developing countries. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the adverse effects of these plants and their preparations. Among them, T. chebula has received high attention because decoction of its fresh and dried fruits is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several illnesses such as laxative, carminative, expectorant, <b>astringent</b> and <b>tonic.</b> The data of acute and chronic toxicity on T. chebula should be obtained in order to increase the confidence in its safety to human, particularly for use in the development of pharmaceutical products. </p...|$|R

40|$|In an {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) rat model, S. chinensis {{reversed the}} exaggerated visceral nocicptive responses (judged by abdominal withdrawal reflex and electromyographic measurement) to colorectal distension induced by neonatal maternal separation. Relief of visceral hypersensitivity by S. chinensis {{could be related to}} the decrease of elevated 5 -HT level and the reduction in 5 -HT 3 receptor expression in colon. In summary, given the modulatory effects on intestinal motility and visceral sensation, Schisandra chinensis would be potentially useful for the treatment of relieving diarrhea and visceral pain symptoms in IBS patients. Schisandra lignans, the major absorbable components, can be regarded as the active ingredients in S. chinensis for the potential treatment of IBS. Schisandra chinensis, which is named "Wu-Wei-Zi" in Chinese Pin Yin, is widely used in Chinese medicine as an <b>astringent,</b> <b>tonic</b> and sedative agent. Dibenzo[a,c]-cyclooctadiene lignans are the major components of this herb. In the present study, the chemical constituents of S. chinensis were first characterized. A HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis of four major Schisandra lignans, namely, schisandrin (SCH- 1), gomisin A (SCH- 2), deoxyschisandrin (SCH- 3) and gamma-schisandrin (SCH- 4), in the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of S. chinensis. The ethanolic extract contains higher amount of lignan components than aqueous extract. The HPLC method has also been employed to obtain chromatographic fingerprintings to distinguish S. chinensis from a related species, S. sphenanthera. The modulatory effects of both S. chinensis extracts and four major lignans on intestinal motility were evaluated using in vitro intestinal motility assays. The tested compounds induced relaxation on guinea pig ileum contracted by acetylcholine, serotonin and electrical field stimulation, as well as on rat colon with spontaneous contractility. While SCH- 3 was most potent in inhibiting sensorimotor response in guinea pig ileum, SCH- 1 displayed the highest potency of inhibition on spontaneous contraction of rat colon. The relaxant effect on rat colon induced by SCH- 1 has been demonstrated to involve two or more non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mediators. Nitric oxide was likely {{to be one of the}} inhibitory transmitters that involved cGMP-dependent pathways, whereas the non-nitrergic component was apamin-sensitive, but probably excluded vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and adenosine. With the aid of HPLC-DAD-MS for qualitative and quantitative analyses, the absorption of S. chinensis in the rat everted gut sac and human Caco- 2 monolayer in vitro models have been profiled. Fifteen Schisandra lignans were identified as the major absorbable components of S. chinensis in these models. Transport study on SCH- 1 has shown a passive diffusion pathway with high permeability. In an in vivo study, metabolites of Schisandra lignans could be found in rat plasma after a single oral administration of S. chinensis extract. The plasma pharmacokinetics of S. chinensis in rats was further evaluated using simultaneous quantification of four representative Schisandra lignans (SCH- 1, SCH- 2, SCH- 3 and SCH- 4).

In traditional medicine practice, seeds are used in the treatment of tissue inflammation, cancer and skin diseases, leprosy, and poison antidote. Embryo of lotus seeds is used in traditional Chinese medicine as Lian Zi Xin, which primarily helps to overcome nervous disorders, insomnia, and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and arrhythmia). Nutritional value of lotus is as important as pharmaceutical value. These days’ different parts of lotus have been consumed as functional foods. Thus, lotus can be regarded as {{a potential}} nutraceutical source...|$|R
40|$|Since {{ancient times}} plant {{as sources of}} {{medicinal}} compounds have continued to play a dominant role in the maintenance of human health. To treat chronic and infectious diseases plants used in traditional medicine contain {{a wide range of}} ingredients. In this regard, Cassia auric-ulata L. (Caesalpiniaceae) is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine as a <b>tonic,</b> <b>astringent</b> and as a remedy for diabetes, conjunctivitis, ulcers, leprosy, skin and liver diseases. The aim of present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of Cassia auricula-ta leaves and flowers (CALE & CAFE). CALE and CAFE exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and exhibited no antifungal activity against standard strains of Candida albi-cans and Aspergillus niger. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was carried out for CALE and CAFE. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the CALE and CAFE can be a potential source of natural antimi-crobial agents.

30|$|The INCI list {{indicates}} the possible functions in cosmetic products. Some natural substances are ‘antiseborrheic’[*], ‘emollient’[*], ‘keratolytic’[*], ‘refreshing’[*], ‘skin conditioning’[*], ‘skin protecting’[*], ‘smoothing’[*], ‘soothing’[*], ‘solvent’[*], or ‘tonic’. Only one ‘colorant’ (Beta vulgaris/Beta vulgaris extract) and one ‘hair dye’ (Lawsonia inermis extract, {{which is the}} extract of the henna plant) is among them. Some are ‘antimicrobials’[*], {{but no one has}} the function ‘preservative’ (Note: There are many non-natural compounds listed in the INCI with the function ‘preservative’, e.g. benzylalcohol or benzylparaben.). For Usnea barbata extract, the function ‘deodorant’ and for ten other natural substances, e.g. Citrus aurantium bergamia oil, Mentha viridis oil¸ Prunus amygdalus amara oil, Ruta graveolens oil, and Sambucus nigra oil, ‘masking’ was the only function indicated. Some natural substances are ‘deodorant’ or ‘masking’ in addition to other functions, e.g. ‘tonic’. Other cosmetic ingredients used due to their odor are listed in the INCI list part II ‘Perfume and aromatic raw materials’ [15] and not in the INCI list analyzed here. It was found that some substances with different INCI names, different origins, obviously different chemical compositions, and also different functions in a product were itemized with identical EC and CAS numbers in the INCI list, e.g. Avena sativa bran extract (abrasive), Avena sativa extract (emollient), and Avena sativa meal extract (soothing), all three with the CAS 84012 - 26 - 0 and the EC 281 - 672 - 4, or Citrus aurantium dulcis flower oil (<b>astringent</b> and <b>tonic),</b> Citrus aurantium dulcis flower water (skin conditioning), Citrus aurantium dulcis peel cera (emollient and skin conditioning), Citrus aurantium dulcis peel extract (emollient, skin conditioning), and Citrus aurantium dulcis seed extract (skin conditioning), all five with the CAS 8028 - 48 - 6 and the EC 232 - 433 - 8.|$|R
40|$|Andrographis is a genus of Acanthaceae family, 21 {{species of}} which occur in India. The most useful one is Andrographis paniculata Nees. 1, 2 The herb A. paniculata is {{reported}} to possess <b>tonic,</b> <b>astringent,</b> anodyne and alexipharmic properties, and is helpful in dysentery, cholera, diabetes, consumption, influenza, bronchitis, swellings, itches, piles, and gonorrhoea. 2 A decoction of the plant {{is reported to}} be a blood purifier and is used as a cure for torpid liver and jaundice. The leaves and roots are also used as febrifuge, tonic, stomachic, cholagogue and anthelmintic. A tincture of the root is tonic, stimulant and aperient. 3 A compilation of the chemical constituents of the genus Andrographis, covering the literature upto 1997, has been done by Saxena et al. 4 The present review is an attempt to compile and tabulate the chemical constituents of the genus Andrographis available in the literature till October, 2006. Their spectral data and biological activities not covered adequately earlier are also included. Semisynthetic studies leading to the preparation of a number of potent and novel analogues of andrographolide and interesting andrographolide metabolites have also been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract –Rumex obtusifolius L. (Polygonaceae), {{commonly}} known as ‘broad-leaf dock’, {{is one of the}} most common Irish wayside weeds, and it also occurs in silage fields, on river banks, in ditches and on waste grounds. The ethnobotanical uses of this species include its use as an antidote to nettle, depurative, <b>astringent,</b> laxative, and <b>tonic,</b> and in the treatment of sores, blisters, burns, cancer and tumors. The bioactivities of n-hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) extracts of the leaves of R. obtusifolius were assessed using the 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, the newly developed micro-titer-based antimicrobial assay incorporating resazurin as an indicator of cell growth, and the brine shrimp lethality assay. The most potent free radical scavenging activity was displayed by the MeOH extract with a RC 50 value of 7. 80 x 10 - 2 mg/mL. Among the fractions obtained from solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the MeOH extract, the 50 % aqueous methanolic SPE fraction exhibited the highest levels of free radical scavenging property (RC 50 = 1. 05 x 10 - 2 mg/mL). While the n-hexane extract did not show any antibacterial activity at test concentrations, the DCM extract was active only against Escherichia coli. However, the MeOH extract as well as the 50 % and 80 % SPE fractions of the MeOH extract showed significant antibacterial property against all bacterial strains tested...|$|R
