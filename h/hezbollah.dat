25|$|The sixth {{anniversary of}} Hariri's assassination, on 14 February 2011 {{was met with}} renewed enthusiasm by {{supporters}} of the March 14 coalition. This was especially fueled by the protesters' anger over the resignation of all ten ministers aligned with the opposing March 8 coalition due to then-prime minister Saad Hariri, Rafik Hariri's son, refusal of <b>Hezbollah's</b> demand he reject the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. A rally was also organized to call for <b>Hezbollah's</b> disarmament {{on the day of}} March 13 in Beirut's Martyrs' Square. No significant disruptions took place, but it was reported by several TV stations that some protesters had their signs demanding <b>Hezbollah's</b> disarmament confiscated.
