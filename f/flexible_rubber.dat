25|$|Triffids later {{appeared}} in the 1981 BBC serial, {{in which they are}} portrayed much as described in the book. Designed by Steve Drewett, the triffids were operated by a man crouched inside, cooled by a fan installed in its neck; the 'clackers' were radio-controlled. The gnarled bole—based on the ginseng root—was made of latex with a covering of sawdust and string, while the neck was fibreglass and continued to the floor, where it joined with the operator's seat. The plants were surmounted by a <b>flexible</b> <b>rubber</b> head, coated with clear gunge. After the end of the production, one was displayed for a time in the Natural History Museum in London, where Drewett had once been employed. Some inferior copies of the props were later used in a cocktail party sketch in an episode of Alexei Sayle's Stuff.|$|E

500|$|Fargo then built a {{pumping plant}} {{employing}} seven electric powered rotary pumps, to move river water up a [...] pipeline to a bluff about [...] above the Muskegon River. A diameter reduction to [...] increased {{the pressure to}} about 80 PSI, and the water was fed into nozzles via <b>flexible</b> <b>rubber</b> hoses. The high pressure streams of water carried away a soil water mix into iron troughs which routed the material about [...] at a slight downgrade back to the dam site. As the material was deposited it was layered, and the water allowed to drain off, compacting it. During this phase, the river was allowed to run through the powerhouse raceways and out the spillway.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] was {{accompanied}} by a black-and-white music video that was directed by Herb Ritts and was filmed on July 22, 1989 at Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu, California. Its world premiere took place on MTV on August 28, 1989. Ritts was one of Madonna's preferred photographers at that time and so she asked him to direct the [...] "Cherish" [...] video. Ritts reportedly tried to talk her out of it by saying, [...] "But I'm a still photographer. I don't know anything about film." [...] Undaunted, Madonna replied simply, [...] "Well you have a few weeks to learn." [...] The video was conceptualized by Ritts, who wanted to portray mermen in their natural habitat, but Madonna baulked at the idea since she wanted to be portrayed as herself, but keep the mermen also. Four male performers were signed for this, one of them being Tony Ward, who would become Madonna's boyfriend later, with the other three being water polo players from nearby Pepperdine University. There were four merman tails created by Global Effects in North Hollywood, California for the video. Three full-size tails for the mermen were cast in a solid highly <b>flexible</b> <b>rubber,</b> each weighing around 40lbs. This was necessary to make them neutrally buoyant in water as lighter tails would have floated, causing the swimmers to be head-down in the sea. Once in these tails, the polo players needed to be carried to and from the water and once in it, they had tremendous swimming power and agility. This was partly due to a plastic spring-like armature cast into the flipper of each tail. One of the reasons this video was shot in black and white is because the water was very cold, causing Madonna's already pale complexion to look even whiter.|$|E

Deletion of the undercarriage would reduce the aircraft weight, allow extra fuel to be carried, and ease deck handling. Despite demonstrating that the technique was feasible, with many landings being made with undercarriage retracted on flexible decks both at RAE Farnborough and on board the carrier HMS Warrior, the proposal was not taken further. Aviation author Geoffrey Cooper quotes author Marriott stating that the rubber deck system [...] "..would have required extensive facilities both aboard ship and at naval air stations to support it. Any gains in aircraft performance were more than cancelled by the complexity and cost of implementation."." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{compasses}} usually use a magnetized needle or dial {{inside a}} capsule completely {{filled with a}} liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol is common). While older designs commonly incorporated a <b>flexible</b> <b>rubber</b> diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result. The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp {{the movement of the}} needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability. [...] Key points on the compass, including {{the north end of the}} needle are often marked with phosphorescent, photoluminescent, or self-luminous materials to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light. [...] As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary liquid-filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of rubber}} pessaries for {{contraception}} likely {{arose from the}} 19th-century practice of correcting a prolapsed uterus with such a device; the condition {{seems to have been}} far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a pessary for birth control. As with the production of condoms for men, the development of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive. Other terms for the contraceptive diaphragm were [...] "female preventatives", [...] "female protectors", [...] "Victoria's protectors", and the [...] "French pessary" [...] ("F.P.") or pessaire preventif. This linguistic variety, some of it euphemistic, makes it difficult to distinguish in the literature among diaphragms, cervical caps, female condoms, and other pessaries; one form of [...] "womb veil" [...] is described in 1890 as [...] "like a ring pessary covered by a membraneous envelope."

40|$|The {{development}} of a method for integrating highly efficient energy conversion materials onto stretchable, biocompatible rubbers could yield breakthroughs in implantable or wearable energy harvesting systems. Being electromechanically coupled, piezoelectric crystals represent a particularly interesting subset of smart materials that function as sensors/actuators, bioMEMS devices, and energy converters. Yet, the crystallization of these materials generally requires high temperatures for maximally efficient performance, rendering them incompatible with temperature-sensitive plastics and rubbers. Here, we overcome these limitations by presenting a scalable and parallel process for transferring crystalline piezoelectric nanothick ribbons of lead zirconate titanate from host substrates onto <b>flexible</b> <b>rubbers</b> over macroscopic areas. Fundamental characterization of the ribbons by piezo-force microscopy indicates that their electromechanical energy conversion metrics are among the highest reported on a flexible medium. The excellent performance of the piezo-ribbon assemblies coupled with stretchable, biocompatible rubber may enable a host of exciting avenues in fundamental research and novel applications. ...|$|R

2500|$|Later that year, {{he created}} two {{additional}} automata, The Tambourine Player and The Digesting Duck, {{which is considered}} his masterpiece. The duck had over 400 moving parts in each wing alone, and could flap its wings, drink water, digest grain, and defecate. [...] Although Vaucanson's duck supposedly demonstrated digestion accurately, his duck actually contained a hidden compartment of [...] "digested food", so that what the duck defecated {{was not the same}} as what it ate; the duck would eat a mixture of water and seed and excrete a mixture of bread crumbs and green dye that appeared to the onlooker indistinguishable from real excrement. Although such [...] "frauds" [...] were sometimes controversial, they were common enough because such scientific demonstrations needed to entertain the wealthy and powerful to attract their patronage. Vaucanson is credited as having invented the world's first <b>flexible</b> <b>rubber</b> tube while in the process of building the duck's intestines. Despite the revolutionary nature of his automata, he is said to have tired quickly of his creations and sold them in 1743.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} role of {{single-chain}} elasticity, non-affine strain fields and pre-stressed reference states we present and discuss the results of numerical and analytical analyses of modified 8 -chain Arruda-Boyce model for cross-linked polymer networks. This class of models has proved highly successful in modeling the finite-strain response of <b>flexible</b> <b>rubbers.</b> We extend it to include the effects of spatial disorder and the associated non-affinity, {{and use it to}} assess the validity of replacing the constituent chain's nonlinear elastic response with equivalent linear, Hookean springs. Surprisingly, we find that even in the regime of linear response, the full polymer model gives very different results from its linearized counterpart, even though none of the chains are stretched beyond their linear regime. We demonstrate that this effect {{is due to the fact}} that the polymer models are under considerable pre-stress in their ground state. We show that pre-stress strongly suppresses non-affinity in these unit cell models, resulting in a marked stiffening of the bulk response. The effects of pre-stress we discuss may explain why fully affine mechanical models, in many cases, predict the bulk mechanical response of disordered stiff polymer networks so well.
