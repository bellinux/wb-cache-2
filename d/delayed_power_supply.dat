40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{integrity}} on a design {{has become a}} critical issue, not only for functional verification, but also for performance verification. Traditional analysis has typically applied a worst case voltage drop at all points along a circuit path {{which leads to a}} very conservative analysis. We also show that in certain cases, the traditional analysis can be optimistic, since it ignores the possibility of voltage shifts between driver and receiver gates. In this paper, we propose a new analysis approach for computing the maximum path <b>delay</b> under <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> fluctuations. Our analysis is based on the use of superposition, both spatially across different circuit blocks, and temporally in time. We first present an accurate model of path delay variations under supply drops, considering both the effect of local supply reduction at individual gates and voltage shifts between driver/receiver pairs. We then formulate the path delay maximization problem as a constrained linear optimization problem, considering the effect of both IR drop and LdI/dt drops. We show how correlations between currents of different circuit blocks can be incorporated in this formulation using linear constraints. The proposed methods were implemented and tested on benchmark circuits, including an industrial <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> grid and we demonstrate a significant improvement in the worst-case path delay increase. ...|$|R

40|$|Today's {{very deep}} {{sub-micron}} technologies enable highly complex chip designs that operate {{at very high}} frequencies. Transistor dimensions have shrunk to a few tens of nanometers. Therefore, to ensure reliable chip operation and to reduce both dynamic and static power consumption the chip's supply voltage must be scaled down. This scaling of the maximum supply voltage reduces noise margins and makes designs susceptible to <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> noise is the variation in the chip <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> i. e. IR and $Ldi/dt$ drops due to the power grid and package parasitics. As the supply voltage drops it causes {{an increase in the}} propagation delay. Transition-fault testing is a widely used test technique in the industry that can detect delay defects. In order to minimize the testing overhead, ATPG tools generate vectors that target multiple faults at the same time. However, these vectors cause excessive switching in the circuit and therefore increase <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise. As the propagation <b>delay</b> increases with <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise this can lead to a significant overkill when using transition test patterns.

40|$|Abstract — When {{designing}} the control loops for tokamaks, {{it is important}} to acknowledge the effects of time delays. An assumption sometimes made for tokamaks having supercon-ducting coils is that these extra time delays will not have any undesirable effects on control. In fact, introducing extra delays into the axisymmetric control loops of certain superconducting tokamaks can have significant detrimental consequences. Aside from qualitative observations, the detrimental effects of extra time delays in tokamak control loops are not always well understood outside the control community. This study exposes and quantifies the detrimental effects imposed by time delays in the control loop in superconducting tokamaks, by focusing on plasma current control and radial position control in a vertically stable circular plasma in the KSTAR tokamak. <b>Delays</b> in the <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> data acquisition, and vessel structure are taken into account.

40|$|Rapidly {{switching}} {{currents of}} the on-chip devices can cause {{fluctuations in the}} supply voltage which can be classified as IR and Ldi/dt drops. The voltage fluctuations in a supply network can inject noise in a circuit which may lead to functional failures of the design. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> integrity verification is, therefore, a critical concern in high-performance designs. Also, with decreasing supply voltages, gate-delay is becoming increasingly sensitive to supply voltage variation. With ever-diminishing clock periods, accurate analysis {{of the impact of}} supply voltage on circuit performance has also become critical. Increasing power consumption and clock frequency have exacerbated the Ldi/dt drop in every new technology generation. The Ldi/dt drop has become the dominant portion of the overall supply-drop in high performance designs. On-die passive decap, which has traditionally been used for suppressing Ldi/dt, has become expensive due to its area and leakage power overhead. This has created an urgent need for novel circuit techniques to suppress the Ldi/dt drop in power distribution networks. We provide accurate algorithmic solutions for determining the worst-case supply-drop and the impact of supply noise on circuit performance. We propose a path-based and a block-based approach for computing the maximum circuit <b>delay</b> under <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> fluctuations. We also propose an early-mode supply-drop estimation approach and a statistical approach for power grid analysis. All the proposed approaches are vectorless and account for both IR and Ldi/dt drops.

Measurements on the test-chip demonstrate a reduction in the supply fluctuations by 57 % for a ramp loads and by 75 % during resonance.

A multiple input, multiple output, Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, assigning the voltage in the correction coils, was designed using these models for the control of RWMs in ITER plasmas with different degrees of instability. In spite of the screening effect of the vacuum vessel outer wall, the controller is able to suppress highly unstable RWM without using the second derivative of the measured poloidal magnetic perturbation. It was found that highly unstable RWMs can be stabilized with voltages about 300 V/turn. The effect of filtering of the diagnostics signal on the RWM control was studied with the goal to reduce AC losses in the superconducting coils. The cutoff frequency for a highly unstable RWM can be as low as 300 Hz without significant deterioration of the RWM control.
