50|$|C. mutabilis {{is often}} {{confused}} with the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cotinis nitida). Both {{are members of the}} flower beetle subfamily (Cetoniinae), and are similar in appearance, but the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> is smaller, and its range is in the eastern United States. The only possible crossover of both species is in Texas.|$|E
50|$|Rhizotrogus is a genus of scarab <b>beetles</b> (and <b>June</b> <b>beetles)</b> in the Melolonthinae subfamily.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{well-known}} beetles from the Scarabaeidae are Japanese <b>beetles,</b> dung <b>beetles,</b> <b>June</b> <b>beetles,</b> rose chafers (Australian, European, and North American), rhinoceros beetles, Hercules beetles and Goliath beetles.|$|R
50|$|Phyllophaga is a {{very large}} genus (more than 260 species) of New World scarab beetles in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May <b>beetles,</b> <b>June</b> bugs, and <b>June</b> <b>beetles.</b> They range in size from 12 to 35 mm and are blackish or reddish-brown in colour, without prominent markings, and often rather hairy ventrally. These beetles are nocturnal, coming to lights in great numbers.|$|R
50|$|Cotinis nitida, {{commonly}} known as the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> June bug or <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a beetle of the family Scarabaeidae. It is found in the eastern United States, where it is most abundant in the south. It is sometimes confused with the related southwestern species figeater beetle Cotinis mutabilis, which is less destructive.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} {{life cycle}} {{for the green}} <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> is one year.|$|E
50|$|Cotinis aliena (also Keys green <b>June</b> <b>beetle)</b> is {{a species}} of Cotinis found in the Florida Keys.|$|E
40|$|Phyllophaga adults (<b>June</b> <b>beetles)</b> were {{surveyed}} from 1984 through 1987 at five locations in Wisconsin using black light traps. Data were collected at each location for three consecutive years. A total of 9, 259 specimens representing 13 species were {{collected during the}} survey. Species captured, sex ratios, and flight periods for abundant species were recorded for each location. Species abundance differed from previous surveys of Phyllophaga in Wisconsin. Possible reasons for observed shifts in species abundance are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The species M. pectoralis looks similar, but its pygidium is rounded. The {{cockchafer}} {{should not}} be confused with the similar European chafer (Rhizotrogus majalis), which has a completely different life cycle, nor with the <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Phyllophaga spp.), which are native to North America, nor with the summer chafer (or [...] "European June bug", Amphimallon solstitiale), which emerges in June and has a two-year life cycle. (All of these are Scarabaeidae, have white grubs, and are turf pests.) ...|$|R
50|$|The beetle has {{a two-year}} {{development}} cycle. The larvae feed on plant roots and humus. The larvae pupate in late May. In late <b>June,</b> adult <b>beetles</b> surface from the soil.|$|R
5000|$|The larval cycle for {{the species}} is likely 1 year, based on the absence of larvae (grubs) in burrows during the adult flight season. The food source for Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae while {{underground}} is unknown, but other species of <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> are known to eat [...] "plant roots or plant detritus and associated decay organisms". [...] stated, [...] "June beetle exhibits no specific host preferences, and larvae likely consume any available organic resources— including organic debris— encountered within the alluvial habitat." [...] Specific host plant associations for Casey’s <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> are not known. Although visual surveys have detected a concentration of emergence burrows {{in the vicinity of}} a number of species of woody shrub in Palm Canyon Wash, {{this may be due to}} low soil disturbance by vehicles, foot traffic, and horses near woody vegetation.|$|E
50|$|This park is {{also the}} place where the type {{specimen}} of Phyllophaga nebulosa, a species of <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> was found and is currently the only known location for this species.|$|E
50|$|Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dinacoma caseyi, is a beetle in the scarab family (Scarabaeidae). It {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species with approximately 587 acres (237 hectares) of land as critical habitat in Riverside County, California.|$|E
50|$|Cotinis mutabilis, {{also known}} as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), {{is a member of the}} scarab beetle family. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US; however, they are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as their eastern cousins.|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} white grubs {{are found in}} Iowa croplands: the true white grub, which can cause {{significant}} stand loss in corn and sometimes soybean; and the annual white grub, which probably does not cause stand loss in either crop. True white grubs are the larvae of <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (the big brown beetles that fly around yard lights during May and June evenings). They feed on the roots of seedling plants, causing them to wilt and die. True white grubs have a 3 -year life cycle and can reduce plant populations during 2 of these 3 years. Predicting what corn or soybean fields might have problems from true white grubs is nearly impossible...|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. The cerambycid beetle borers {{play an important role in}} Hawaiian forests, both in the natural and disturbed environments. Their significance is enhanced by the disharmonic nature of the fauna, such as the lack of leaf <b>beetles</b> and <b>june</b> <b>beetles,</b> in the native fauna. There are about 120 known species of endemic cerambycids, almost entirely restricted to native trees and shrubs, and 17 species of established exotic cerambycids, which with few exceptions bore in exotic trees. The seasonal occurrence, as far as known of the adult cerambycids is tabulated. Altitudinal range and latest year of collection (native) or earliest year of record (exotic) are also tabulated. In a further tabulation, the species for which host associations are known are presented by host genera under plant families, and by islands.

5000|$|The Death Valley <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> {{does not}} carry any {{official}} conservation status, but {{is listed as}} a Species of Concern by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The California Department of Fish and Game considers the beetle a [...] "Special Animal" [...] of high conservation need.|$|E
50|$|Females burrow into {{ground in}} search of grubs, {{particularly}} those of the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cotinis nitida, and the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica. The wasp stings the grub and frequently burrows farther down to construct a cell and lay an egg on the host. The larva pupates and overwinters inside {{the body of the}} host.|$|E
50|$|The Death Valley <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (Polyphylla erratica) is a scarab beetle in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. It is {{only known}} {{to occur in}} the drainage basin of the Amargosa River in the southwestern United States.Saltgrass communities, such as those at Saratoga Springs in Death Valley, provide habitat for the insect at all stages of its life.|$|E
5000|$|Based on surveys {{conducted}} {{to assess the}} species' presence, {{both male and female}} Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> emerge from underground burrows sometime between late March and early June, with abundance peaks generally occurring in April and May. Females are always observed on the ground and are considered flightless. [...] stated that [...] "Female Dinacoma are very rare in collections. Females display an accentuated sexual dimorphism characterized by an enlarged abdomen, reduced legs and antennae, and metathoracic wing reduction and venation. These characters are likely adaptations to flightlessness and a fossorial biology." [...] During the active flight season, males emerge from the ground and begin flying near dusk. Males are reported to fly back and forth or crawl on the ground where a female beetle has been detected. [...] theorized that after emergence, females remain on the ground and release pheromones to attract flying males. After mating, females return to their burrows or dig a new burrow and deposit eggs. Excavations of adult emergence burrows revealed pupal exuviae (casings) at depths ranging from approximately 4 to 6 in (10 to 16 cm).|$|R
5000|$|Ithonidae are {{typically}} medium to large-sized neuropterans. P. S. Welch conducted research in 1914 on [...] "Polystoechotidae" [...] larvae {{resulting in the}} conclusion that the larvae were carnivorous. [...] The first instar stage for modern larvae is a carabaeiform grub. [...] Robert J. Tillyard first described the larvae of Ithone fusca in 1922, noting the unusual grub-like shape, similar to fruit-chafers and <b>June</b> <b>beetles,</b> as unique among Neuroptera species. The odd larval shape of Ithionidae larvae has been, and continues to be, a subject of interest among entomologists. Tillyard suggested the larvae to be carnivorous, preying upon Scarabaeidae larvae, attacking with the large mandibles and [...] "sucking them dry". [...] Further study by Faulkner in 1990 has shown the immature Ithonidae to be phytophagous, a condition unique among neuropterans. [...] The genus Rapisma was formerly considered distinct from the Ithonidae and placed in the monotypic family Rapismatidae. Recent studies have favored inclusion into Ithonidae, while this is not always followed, it has been supported by recent phylogenetic work. [...] Mass emergences have been recorded from the genera Oliarces and Ithone, usually associated with seasonal rains.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{locomotion}} response of airborne, ambulatory and aquatic insects to thermal stimulation. A {{finite element model}} has been developed to predict the variation of insect–stimulator interface temperature with input power. Piezothermal stimulators have been fabricated from lead zirconate titanate (PZT) using a batch mode micro ultrasonic machining process. Typical sizes range from 200 µm to 3. 2 mm. For PZT stimulators, the temperature and thermal efficiency reach the maximum value around the resonance frequency which is typically {{in the range of}} 650 kHz to 47 MHz. Experiments have been conducted on green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJBs), Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDBs) in order to show the versatility of the proposed technique. The stimulators have been implanted near the antennae of the GJBs and {{on either side of the}} thorax of the Madagascar hissing roaches and GDBs, respectively. In all cases, the insects move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. The left and right turns are statistically similar. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 78. 7 %, 92. 8 % and 61. 6 % in GJBs, roaches and GDBs, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 13. 7 °– 16. 2 ° on GJBs, 30 °– 45 ° on the roaches and 30 °– 50 ° on GDBs. The corresponding average input power is 360, 330 and 100 mW for GJBs, roach and GDBs, respectively. Scaling limits of the PZT stimulators for operating these stimulators are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Zayante sandhills {{ecosystem}} is {{not only}} home to the endangered Zayante band-winged grasshopper, but also to other unique species, {{many of which are}} on the endangered species list, including the Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Santa Cruz wallflower, Ben Lomond buckwheat, Bonny Doon manzanita, Ben Lomond spineflower, and the Santa Cruz kangaroo rat (Donald J. Barry 2000).|$|E
50|$|Polyphylla barbata is a {{rare species}} of beetle known by the common name Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle.</b> It is endemic to California, where it occurs only in Santa Cruz County.

50|$|The grapevine beetle, Pelidnota punctata, {{also known}} as the spotted <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> or the spotted pelidnota, is a species of beetle, a member of the {{subfamily}} Rutelinae of the Scarab beetle family. Grapevine beetles are common in the north and central United States and Eastern Canada, but do relatively little damage to their host plants. The beetles fly at a fast speed, usually in a curving flight.|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of bulk micromachined {{piezoelectric}} transducers for ultrasonic heat generation. The work includes basic studies of the phenomenon, the development of simulation models, the design and fabrication of practical devices and interface circuits. The technology is demonstrated in two application contexts: cauterization with a biopsy needle, and stimulation of insect locomotion. Simulations based on three-dimensional finite element models, indicate that circular disc-shaped elements provide superior steady-state temperature rise for a given cross-sectional area, volume of the PZT element, and drive voltage. The heating is greatest at the frequency of maximum electromechanical conductance. The thermal efficiency is maximized at frequency of maximum electromechanical impedance. Stacked PZT heaters provide 3. 5 x the temperature rise and 3 x greater efficiency than single elements. A biopsy needle with an embedded array of four piezoceramic microheaters of 200 µm diameter and 70 - 80 µm thickness has been fabricated. The PZT- 5 A heaters generate the target temperature rise of 33 ˚C at the tissue-needle interface for an input power of < 325 mW and a drive voltage of < 17 VRMS when inserted into porcine tissue. The extent of tissue cauterization is < 1. 25 mm beyond {{the perimeter of the}} needle. Cauterization of porcine tissue sample results in a decrease of 600 kHz in the resonance frequency and 900 ohms in the peak impedance magnitude, allowing the extent of cauterization to be monitored easily. Interface circuits for measurement of resonance frequency shift due to cauterization and for actuation of PZT heaters are also described. Experiments have been conducted using piezothermal stimulators implanted near antennae of green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJB), and {{on either side of the}} thorax of Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDB) to show the feasibility of locomotion control using microthermal stimulation. Thermal stimulation causes the insects to move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 80 %, 93. 5 % and 68 % in GJB, roaches and GDB, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 15 ˚- 18 ˚ on GJB, 30 ˚- 45 ˚ on the roaches and 15 ˚- 60 ˚ on GDB. The corresponding average input power is 360 mW, 330 mW and 100 mW for GJB, roach, and GDB, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{life history}} of the {{strawberry}} root weevil, Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.), on peppermint was studied in the Willamette Valley of Oregon to provide the information necessary to develop effective control measures. Adult weevils emerged from the soil from late May until mid- June and were active in the field until late July. Active feeding by adults occurred between one and seven hours after sunset. No significant migration {{for the purpose of}} feeding or oviposition was observed and no adults were found to overwinter. Oviposition occurred from mid-June until September in the laboratory but ceased by late July in the field. Egg incubation periods averaged 13 days in the laboratory with fertility rates of 70 to 80 percent. Fertility declined substantially in the laboratory after late July. Larvae occurred in the peppermint root systems from early June until late May of the following year with pupation occurring from mid-April until the first of <b>June.</b> Carabid <b>beetles,</b> Omaseus melanarius, were found to be predaceous on adult strawberry root weevils but no other predators or parasites were discovered. Laboratory studies indicate that desiccation is a potential mortality factor acting on all immature stages...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Texas school district personnel were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire to determine the status of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs and the efficacy of conventional pest control practices. Of the 517 survey participants, 12. 4 % had procedures for IPM, and almost 28 % had official procedures for pesticide use (N= 1047). Over 75 % of Texas school districts contracted their general pest control activities to professionally licensed pest control firms. Specialty services such as termite control were contracted with licensed companies for almost 90 % of Texas districts. The principle in-house pest control practices (77. 3 %) were for weed control. A majority of districts (56. 3 %) were considered small (< three schools per district), and most (67. 8 %) budget $ 5000 or less for all pest control services. Present pest control practices were considered to be moderately to extremely effective by 87. 4 % of responding districts. The most important indoor pests, reported by the questionnaire responses, were cockroaches, ants, rodents, termites and head lice. Outdoor pests included fire ants (Solenopsis spp.), stinging (bees, wasps and hornets), flying (mosquitoes and gnats) and turfgrass insects (<b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> and mole crickets) and weeds. Control measures used by schools were categorized as non-chemical and chemical. Non-chemical pest control measures (mechanical and cultural controls) were used by at least 42 % of Texas schools. Results of the survey indicated that many different pesticides were used by school systems. When asked about specific pests and control measures, respondents frequently indicated that either the pest was not a problem or no chemicals were used for-their control. The most commonly selected insecticides by school district personnel were Dursban [chlorpyrifos], diazinon, and pyrethr-um products. Ten schools from different districts, representing all Texas regions and demographics, were selected for site visits and sticky trap sampling. The sampling program indicated that the most frequently encountered indoor pests, in order of importance, were German cockroaches [Blattella gerinanica (Linnaeus) ], Pharaoh [Monomotium pharaonis (L.) ] or crazy ants [Paratrechina longicomis (Latreille) ], followed by house crickets [Acheta domesticus (L.) ] and American cockroaches [Periplaneta atneiicana (L.) ]. High incidences of insects were detected in areas where food was stored and processed, such as food preparation equipment, vending machines, ovens and stoves...|$|R
50|$|The green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is active}} during {{daylight}} hours. The adult is usually 15 - 22 mm long with dull, metallic green wings; its sides are gold and the head, legs and underside are very bright shiny green. Their habitat extends from Maine to Georgia, {{and as far}} west as Kansas, with possible population crossover in Texas with their western cousin, the figeater beetle.|$|E
50|$|There are {{nineteen}} species {{endemic to}} the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument area. These species require or {{are restricted to}} a small geographical area which makes them vulnerable to habitat disturbance. A few of these species are Johnston's rockcress, Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Coachella Valley round-tailed ground squirrel, Munz's mariposa lily, San Jacinto bush snapdragon, Santa Rosa Mountain linanthus, Tahquitz ivesia, and Ziegler’s aster.|$|E
5000|$|Phyllophaga nebulosa is {{a species}} of <b>june</b> <b>beetle</b> endemic to Jones Lake State Park in North Carolina.

This beetle is nocturnal and was discovered living in sandy soil near conifers, which is unusual for members of its genus.|$|E
50|$|Female chafers lay 20-40 eggs {{over their}} lifespan. They are laid singly, 5 - 10 cm deep in moist soil, and take 2 weeks to hatch. The grubs hatch by late July. The grub {{population}} consists mainly of first instars in early- to mid-August, second instars by early September, and third instars by mid-September to early October. In frost zones, the grubs feed until November, then move {{deeper into the}} soil. In frost-free areas, the larva will feed all winter. Vigorous feeding occurs from March through May. In early June, the grubs again move deeper, from 5 - 25 cm, to form earthen cells and pupate. The pre-pupal and pupal stages last 2-4 days and 2 weeks, respectively. By <b>June,</b> the new <b>beetles</b> begin emerging.|$|R
40|$|In Hokkaido (Japan), the spruce beetle (lps typograpaus japonicus) kills {{standing}} spruce trees after selection cutting. The seasonal {{change in}} the number of beetles captured in 18 - 21 traps within or outside forest was analysed, with reference to a control strategy for this species in a bivoltine area. The number of beetles captured in traps had two peaks: one, which was small, in early June, and the other, which was a large peak, in July. However, the number of beetles captured in traps outside the forest had only one small peak, in June. The difference between the inside and outside of the forest was caused by the difference {{in the number of}} newly emerged beetles captured in traps. Beetles were distributed contagiously within the forest and there was no remarkable change in distribution pattern throughout seasons. Beetles were distributed at random in <b>June</b> when <b>beetle</b> activity was high outside forest. Overwintered beetles must undertake long- range dispersal irrespective of whether they are within or outside of forest for finding suitable breeding materials. Nevertheless, the most important point is that newly emerged beetles stayed inside the forest and only a few individuals dispersed outside the forest. This study recommends that different control methods are adopted according to the seasons for the control of spruce beetles...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, DC {{introduced}} a new Blue Beetle, teenager Jaime Reyes, whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed {{as a piece of}} advanced alien technology. The series was initially written by Keith Giffen and John Rogers, with artist Cully Hamner. Giffen left in issue #10 and Rogers took over full writing duties, joined by a new artist, Rafael Albuquerque. Rogers left the title with issue #25 in order to concentrate on his television series Leverage. After three fill-in issues, Matt Sturges became the main writer in issue #29, but the series was cancelled with issue #36. Editor Dan DiDio put the cancellation down to poor sales and said that Blue Beetle was [...] "a book that we started with very high expectations, but it lost its audience along the way." [...] In <b>June</b> 2009, Blue <b>Beetle</b> was brought back as a [...] "co-feature" [...] of the more popular Booster Gold comic. In September 2011, a new Blue Beetle comic was launched as part of The New 52 initiative, with Jaime Reyes's history being rebooted with a new origin and without any apparent history of Kord or Garrett as prior Blue Beetles. The new book was written by Tony Bedard and drawn by Ig Guara.|$|R
