40|$|Pre-eclampsia (PE) is {{a devastating}} {{condition}} that affects 5 - 8 % {{of pregnant women}} and {{is the leading cause}} of fetal and maternal deaths worldwide. The etiology of this disorder, however, is largely unknown. The BPH/ 5 mouse model is the only known rodent model that spontaneously develops the symptoms of PE as well as many of the placental pathologies associated with the human condition. As the pathogenesis of PE is known to start before the symptoms begin, this disease is very difficult to study in women. As such, this mouse model is invaluable in examining early pregnancy events and elucidating the pathophysiology of this disorder. Angiogenic factors have been promising biomarkers of PE in women. We found that the angiogenic profile in BPH/ 5 mice mimics that of women at high risk of developing PE with a decrease in the pro-angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and related placental growth factor (PGF). Using a viral gene transfer strategy to increase systemic levels of one of these important angiogenic factors, VEGF, we provide evidence of a functional link between diminished VEGF levels and the hallmark symptoms of PE in BPH/ 5 mice. The BPH/ 5 model of PE also exhibits significant fetal demise throughout pregnancy. One third of conceptuses are lost by mid gestation. To further characterize early pregnancy events in BPH/ 5, we used ultrasound to score embryos based on their health status. We were able to detect evidence of developmental challenge in vivo in a subset of embryos prior to previous necropsy data. Using <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> with varying development/health status, we performed gene expression microarray studies to examine the molecular cues to fetal demise in this model. Challenged <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> show dysregulation in functional pathways related to angiogenesis, development and apoptosis. Finally, as the placenta plays a pivotal role in the development of PE, and the BPH/ 5 model shows marked placental abnormalities, we examined whether these placental defects in BPH/ 5 could be traced to the peri-implantation period when this organ is established. We found significant pre-implantation embryo maturation delay along with premature maternal endocrine signaling in BPH/ 5 mice, suggesting asynchronous timing of these important events involved in implantation. This was accompanied by implantation defects as indicated by abnormal spacing of implantation sites, as well as morphological and molecular abnormalities in early BPH/ 5 implantation sites compared to controls. Using a protocol to artificially synchronize implantation events in BPH/ 5, we were able to rescue the implantation clustering defect, the molecular dysregulation in early implantation sites, and importantly, several later placental abnormalities including placental expansion toward the decidua and umbilical blood flow. The research in this thesis highlights and confirms the important role of angiogenic factors in successful and healthy pregnancies, provides clues to the molecular signature that may underlie fetoplacental defects associated with PE, and sheds new light on early peri-implantation events that may set the stage for the development of PE and perhaps other disorders of pregnancy...|$|R

Pregnant mice were fed using either unrestricted normal diet with 22 % protein, consumed ad libitum, or a diet containing 14 % protein, with intake restricted to 70 % of that consumed by the unrestricted group. At the end of gestation, the number of <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> and fetal losses, the fetal and placental weight, and the weights of fetal brain and liver were recorded. RESULTS: Fetuses from undernourished mothers showed a reduction in body, placental, and brain weight (P < 0. 01); the association of undernourishment with maternal-fetal genetic compatibility resulted in a greater impairment of fetal growth (P < 0. 01). A reduction in the number of viable fetuses per female in the dietary-restricted groups was observed. (P < 0. 01).

Methods Imaging parameters were optimized using two wild-type (WT) females, bearing Vegfr 2 -luc fetuses. Then, seven WT females, bred to Vegfr 2 -luc males, were imaged from gestational day (GD) 12 to 18 to determine the usefulness of the Vegfr 2 -luc mouse as a model for studying fetoplacental Vegfr 2 activity during pregnancy. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of Vegfr 2 was also performed on whole <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> during this time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Apelin is a {{multifunctional}} peptide {{which is}} catabolized by the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase- 2 (ACE 2). The peptide {{is well known}} for its hemodynamic effects and its role in energy and fluid homeostasis. Pregnancy is a state of dramatically altered maternal hemodynamics and metabolism, but the role of apelin is unknown. To gain further insight in apelin physiology, we investigated relative tissue expression, plasma clearance and metabolic pathways of apelin in pregnant rats. METHODS: We measured maternal plasma apelin levels throughout normal rat gestation and examined relative apelin gene expression in several tissues, including the placenta. We documented apelin clearance using radiolabeled apelin and assessed maternal plasma levels in rats that underwent surgical reduction of the fetoplacental mass, thereby further examining the role of the placenta in apelin clearance. Finally, we localized apelin and ACE 2 in the placenta and mesometrial triangle using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Maternal apelin plasma concentrations dropped by 50 % between mid- and late gestation. Apelin expression was comparable between non-pregnant and late-pregnant rats in non-reproductive tissues. The placenta showed low apelin gene expression compared to brain tissue. Apelin clearance was enhanced in term gestation as evidenced by a steeper decline of the slow phase of the elimination curve of radiolabeled apelin. Compared to sham-operated dams, maternal plasma apelin was raised by 23 % in late-pregnant rats in which half of the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> were removed at day 16 of gestation. ACE 2 mRNA expression was detectable in late- but not mid-pregnancy placental tissue; immunohistochemically, ACE 2 was primarily localized in the smooth muscle layer of fetal arterioles in the labyrinth.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{distribution}} of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in the human placenta at different gestational ages and to determine whether differences in ET- 1 immunoreactivity occurred in preeclamptic compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: Localization of ET- 1 was investigated by the immunoperoxidase technique in first-trimester, second-trimester, and term human placentas from normal pregnancies and in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies. RESULTS: In normal placentas from all gestational ages studied, endothelin- 1 immunoreactivity (ET- 1 IR) was specifically detected in the endothelium of the fetal vessels and in the syncytiotrophoblast. ET- 1 IR was also expressed by the villous cytotrophoblast of first- and second-trimester normal placentas. The extravillous cytotrophoblast of the basal and chorionic plates also exhibited ET- 1 IR, but with varying degrees of intensity. In preeclamptic placentas, the expression of ET- 1 IR was uneven with a negative staining in all placentas from pregnancies between the 29 th and 32 nd weeks of gestation. The expression of ET- 1 IR was most intense in some syncytiotrophoblast tissue in the terminal villi after the 33 rd week of gestation. In placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies between the 35 th and the 36 th weeks of gestation, strong ET- 1 IR expression was evident in the endothelium of fetal vessels and in the syncytiotrophoblast. Regardless of gestational age, ET- 1 IR was also observed in the extravillous cytotrophoblast of the basal and chorionic plates of preeclamptic placentas. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ET- 1 IR is widely distributed in the human placenta and provides further evidence to support the concept that ET- 1 plays an important role as a modulator of vascular tone in the uteroplacental and <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>units</b> and may participate in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia...|$|R
40|$|Early embryo {{losses are}} {{characterized}} by a large infiltration of cnacrophages and NK-cells in the decidua surrounding resorbing embryos. This infiltration is combined with a high expression of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and inducible nitric oxide mRNA in the maternal tissue. After receiving proper priming (IFNgamma) and triggering signal (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNFalpha), decidual macrophages can secrete TNFalpha, nitric oxide (NO) and other cytotoxic molecules that could potentially damage placental cells and consequently compromise embryo survival. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of activated decidual macrophages on the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit.</b> High and low loss murine mating models have been used to perform cytotoxicity assays. Our results show that: (1) decidual cells from the high loss model have a greater capacity to kill YAC- 1 targets than those from the low loss model; (2) when decidual macrophages and NK cells are separated, both cells demonstrate cytotoxic activity by inducing lysis of the YAC- 1 targets; (3) decidual macrophage-mediated killing of YAC- 1 cells is not related to NO and TNFalpha production but is inhibited by the oxyradical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine in a dose-dependent manner: (4) murine trophoblast cells are resistant to decidual cell-mediated lysis in vitro and inhibit decidual cell-mediated lysis of YAC- 1 targets. Taken together, these results confirm that decidual macrophages and NK cells could be cytotoxic effectors at the maternal/fetal interface, demonstrate that trophoblasts are properly adapted to resist decidual cell-mediated lysis, and suggest that certain reactive oxygen intermediate, might damage cells other than trophoblasts around the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

We sought {{to test the}} underlying hypothesis, i. e. that a monoamniotic state reduces the severity of TTTS. With use of our previously developed mathematical model of two equal <b>fetoplacental</b> circulatory <b>units</b> connected by various sizes and types of placental anastomoses, we compared the haemodynamic and amniotic fluid dynamics of monoamniotic and diamniotic twins that develop TTTS. We used three anastomotic patterns that produce severe, moderate or mild forms of TTTS, respectively, in our diamniotic-monochorionic twin model. Monoamnionicity was modelled by adding the two amniotic fluid volumes and using the volume-averaged amniotic fluid osmolality. The results were as follows: for severe TTTS, small differences develop between diamniotic and monoamniotic donor twins in fetal urine production, swallowed volume, blood volume, blood pressures, net fetofetal transfusion, and blood and amniotic fluid osmolality. However, the circulatory imbalance between the monoamniotic twins deteriorates {{similar to that of}} diamniotic twins. The pathophysiological differences tend to disappear for milder TTTS. In conclusion, our model suggests that the uncommon finding of TTTS in monoamniotic twins is not due to the presence of a single amniotic sac. Rather, clinically significant differences in anastomotic patterns and the delayed or lack of identification of manifestations in monoamniotic twins account for the reduced rate of TTTS diagnosis. Based on these results we expect the clinical disruption of the amnion septum in diamniotic-monochorionic TTTS pregnancies to have only minimal benefit...|$|R

Specifically tolerant mothers, on the other hand, produce smaller, F 1 hybrid, <b>fetoplacental</b> (fp) <b>units.</b> The classic notion that the disparity between the birth weights of F 1 hybrid and homozygous offspring is due to hybrid vigor has been challenged by the finding that DA and (DA times F 1) F 1 hybrid blastocysts transferred to the uteri of genetically tolerant (DA times F 1) F 1 hybrid rats produce fp units of similar weight Maternal immunological reactivity against the fetus qua allograft may make a significant contribution here. Additional support for the premise that maternal reactivity against fetal alloantigens in some way promotes {{the growth of the}} fp unit was afforded by the finding that excision of the para-aortic lymph nodes (which drain the uterine horns) from females before interstrain matings resulted in smaller fp units than in females subjected to sham operations. The finding with one rat strain combination that passive immunization of females with serum against their F 1 hybrid conceptuses promoted the growth of the latter suggests that a humoral rather than a cellular immunity may be involved. Secondly, in the three species studied, it was observed that genetic disparity between a conceptus and its mother significantly improved its chances of implantation and development to term...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExperimental {{tools for}} {{studying}} the complex steroidogenic interactions that occur between placenta and fetus during human pregnancy are extremely limited. We aimed to develop a co-culture model to study steroidogenesis by the human <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit</b> and its disruption by exposure to environmental contaminants. We cultured BeWo human choriocarcinoma cells, representing the villous cytotrophoblast, and H 295 R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells, representing the fetal unit, in a carefully adapted co-culture medium. We placed H 295 R cells in 24 -well plates and BeWo cells on transwell inserts with or without pesticide treatment (atrazine or prochloraz) and assessed CYP 19 activity and hormonal production after 24 hr of co-culture. The co-culture exhibited the steroidogenic profile of the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing a synergistic production of estradiol and estriol (but not of estrone) of 133. 3 ± 11. 3 pg/mL and 440. 8 ± 44. 0 pg/mL, respectively. Atrazine and prochloraz had cell-type specific effects on CYP 19 activity and estrogen production in co-culture. Atrazine induced CYP 19 activity and estrogen production in H 295 R cells only, but did not affect overall estrogen production in co-culture, whereas prochloraz inhibited CYP 19 activity exclusively in BeWo cells and reduced estrogen production in co-culture by almost 90 %. In contrast, prochloraz did not affect estradiol or estrone production in BeWo cells in monoculture. These differential effects underline the relevance of our co-culture approach to model fetoplacental steroidogenesis. The co-culture of H 295 R and BeWo cells creates a unique in vitro model to reproduce the steroidogenic cooperation between fetus and placenta during pregnancy {{and can be used}} to study the endocrine-disrupting effects of environmental chemicals...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE URB 937 is a {{peripherally}} restricted inhibitor of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Despite {{its limited}} access to the CNS, URB 937 produces marked antinociceptive effects in rodents. URB 937 is actively extruded from the CNS by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter, Abcg 2. Tissue Abcg 2 levels are markedly different between males and females, and this transporter is known to limit the access of xenobiotics to the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit</b> in gestating female rodents. In the present study, we investigated the tissue distribution and antinociceptive properties of URB 937 in female mice and rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We studied the systemic disposition of URB 937 in female mice and the antinociceptive effects of this compound in models of visceral (acetic acid-induced writhing) and inflammatory nociception (carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia) in female mice and rats. Furthermore, we evaluated the interaction of URB 937 with the blood-placenta barrier in gestating mice and rats. KEY RESULTS Abcg 2 restricted the access of URB 937 to the CNS of female mice and rats. Nevertheless, URB 937 produced {{a high degree of}} antinociception in female mice and rats in models of visceral and inflammatory pain. Moreover, the compound displayed a restricted access to placental and fetal tissues in pregnant mice and rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Peripheral FAAH blockade with URB 937 reduces nociception in female mice and rats, as previously shown for males of the same species. In female mice and rats, Abcg 2 limits the access of URB 937, not only to the CNS, but also to the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit.</b> © 2012 The British Pharmacological Society...|$|E
40|$|The fate of {{trimethoprim}} and sulfamethoxazole and {{the combination}} of both these agents was studied {{in a group of}} healthy pregnant women who were undergoing therapeutic abortion.

40|$|Summary. Factors {{of making}} and keeping immunotolerance in {{pregnancy}} mainly affect immunocompetent cells by immunosuppressive factors or moving of Th 1 /Th 2 balance {{in favour of}} Th 2 response. Errors made in making and keeping immunotolerance in pregnancy can lead to clinic entities such as resorption of <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit,</b> miscarriage and reduced placental and fetal weight. Besides, production of sex steroids in the yellow body of gravidity {{and later in the}} <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit</b> depends on the factors such as prostaglandins and cytokines. The significance of paternal and maternal MHC (in) compatibility of rats for the number of embryos, percentage of embryos in resorption, placental and fetal weight and the level of serum steroids were tested in our experiment. Specimens taken for this investigation were syngene Sprague Doley (SD) and Wistar (W). The rats of SD and W lineage were treated by indometacin of 2. 1 - 2. 8 mg/kg daily by giving them drinking water in the period of 6 - 18 day of pregnancy. Stimulation of Th 1 response by indometacin in allogenic pregnancy led to resorption of 56 % embryos while the rate of resorption in the control group of W rats was 12 %. Syngene SD animals treated by indometacin did not show a significantly higher rate of embryos in resorption (8. 14 %) than the ones in the control group (5. 13 %) Acceleration of Th 1 response by indometacin led to activation of decidual CTL and NK cells as well as to intensified expression of MHC antigens on the cells of trophoblast. In allogenic pregnancy this resulted in the increased resorption of embryos, while in SYNGENIC pregnancy acceleration of Th 1 response did not result in increased resorption of embryos. Besides, indometacin lead...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Induction {{of labor}} (IOL), using {{intravenous}} oxytocin, is the artificial initiation of labor before its spontaneous onset {{for the purpose}} of delivery of the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit.</b> Although there are various studies looking at dosages of oxytocin, only a few have addressed the issue of discontinuation of oxytocin in the active stage of labor. Thus, our study was conducted to evaluate the need for continuation versus discontinuation of oxytocin during active labor. Methods: This prospective, randomized controlled trial included 106 women who needed IOL. Oxytocin infusion was initiated at a rate of 3 mIU/min and was incremental until 4 – 6 cm cervical dilation. At this point the patients were randomly assigned into one of two groups. In group one, oxytocin was discontinued, and infusion was continued with 0. 9...|$|E
40|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} of pregnancy, "morning sickness", {{is a common}} contemporary complaint. Many pregnant patients note alterations in smell and taste which can precipitate "morning sickness", symptoms that characterize early gestation. Epidemiologic studies suggest that pregnancies accompanied by "morning sickness" have better outcomes than asymptomatic pregnancies. The intimate connection between immunogenetic identity, chemoidentity, and chemocommunication by olfactory mechanisms suggests a relationship between maternal symptoms and maternal accommodation of paternal antigens contained in the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit.</b> Most mammalian species utilize olfaction to reduce inbreeding and thus do not require an intimate placental connection between mother and fetus. The evolution of Homo sapiens included prolonged periods of small, genetically homogeneous foraging groups which limited selection of genetically heterogeneous mates. Adaptation to this circumstance included a reduction of olfactory precision in mate selection and a more intimate association between mother and fetus, the hemochorial placenta (Rev Med Chile 2002; 130 : 580 - 84...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of the in situ {{metabolism}} of progesterone- 4 - 14 C in the midterm human <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit,</b> the labeled hormone was injected into the umbilical vein at the time of hysterotomy and the circulation was left intact for 15 minutes. After delivery, the placenta, umbilical cord, and ten fetal tissues from two male fetus, gestational age 21 weeks, were selected for the isolation of labeled metabolites. A total of eight unconjugated metabolites of progesterone were isolated and identified. The reduced metabolites were 20 α-dihydroprogesterone, pregnanolone, 3 β-hydroxy-pregnan- 20 -one and pregnanediol; the hydroxylated metabolites identified were 6 β-hydroxyprogesterone, 16 α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone and hydrocortisone. These results demonstrated that the human fetus at midterm pregnancy can actively transfom progesterone reaching it from the placenta into a number of reduced and hydroxylated metabolites and that the fetal adrenal and the liver were the most active sites of this metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, a small, facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive motile bacillus, is an {{important}} cause of foodborne illness which disproportionately affects pregnant women and their newborns. Listeria infects many types of animals and contaminates numerous foods including vegetables, milk, chicken and beef.

40|$|A role of placental hormones in the {{regulation}} of maternal and fetal physiology during pregnancy has been suggested. These placental hormones are chemically identical and as active as their hypothalamic/gonadal counterparts. These placental neurohormones act as factors to control the secretion of other regulatory molecules. One of these is corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The secretion of placental CRF is autonomous, but increasing evidence indicates that maternal or fetal physiological and pathological conditions may influence such secretion. In the event of stress, the placenta takes part in a "stress syndrome" by releasing CRF into biological fluids of pregnancy since CRF may contribute to restoring local blood flow, influencing the timing of delivery, and activating labor {{with the aim of}} protecting the <b>fetoplacental</b> <b>unit</b> and helping the fetus to escape from a hostile environment.
