50|$|RHP Luke Weaver was {{recalled}} on July 27, and recalled {{from yesterday}} RHP Mike Mayers was optioned. Weaver is the No. 64 overall prospect in the Majors, and the Cardinals' fourth-best prospect. Weaver {{will make his}} first start in 2017. In two relief appearances with St. Louis this season, Weaver has allowed three <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> no <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> three innings.

25|$|Hill {{joined the}} {{starting}} {{rotation of the}} Cubs after spring training, and was the #4 starter in the rotation behind Carlos Zambrano, Ted Lilly, and Jason Marquis. He pitched against the Milwaukee Brewers for his first start of the 2007 season, throwing a perfect game through the first five innings, and finishing with allowing just one <b>hit,</b> <b>and</b> one <b>run</b> <b>over</b> 7 innings pitched. He continued to excel during April, leading some to speculate that he was taking over as the ace in the Cubs rotation while he assembled a streak of 18 consecutive innings without an earned run.|$|R
25|$|On July 2, Clemens {{collected}} his 350th {{win against}} the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> one <b>run</b> <b>over</b> eight innings. Clemens {{is one of}} only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens's manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008. His final regular season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed 2 <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> 1 unearned <b>run</b> in 6 innings, and received a no-decision. Clemens finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6–6 and a 4.18 ERA.|$|R

Although he lost the game, {{allowing}} seven <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> three <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> 5⅔ innings, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire decided to keep him in the starting rotation. As the Twins pushed for a playoff spot in 2006, Bonser solidified the fifth starter's job. Then, a string of injuries and ineffective pitching by the other Twins pitchers and Bonser's commanding recent performances earned him the #2 spot in the Twins' postseason rotation. In his postseason start, he pitched six innings, allowing two runs, to pick up a no-decision as the Twins lost to the Oakland Athletics.|$|R

50|$|Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) {{and his new}} bride, Jane (Rachael Taylor), leave New York City for Tokyo, Japan, where Ben has {{a job as a}} photographer. While {{travelling}} by car in {{the wilderness}} of the countryside, Jane accidentally hits a girl {{standing in the middle of}} the road and ends up running over her. They could not find a body or even a trace of blood and decide to leave, thinking the victim was alright and had left. They later start to find mysterious lights in their photos, which are later identified as spirit photography by Ben's assistant, Seiko Nakamura (Maya Hazen). Jane begins to have eerie dreams and visions as if they are trying to tell her something and senses a haunting presence stalking them. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and hunched over, although the doctor could not determine what was the actual physical cause of it. Seiko takes Jane to her ex-boyfriend, Ritsuo (James Kyson Lee), whose career is to investigate paranormal activities, and he tells them that the lights in the photos are spirits as well as manifestations of intense emotions that are trying to be communicated. At a subway station, Jane spots the ghostly presence of the girl she <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>over,</b> causing her to believe that she killed the girl. Later, Ben also has a similarly-terrifying encounter. They go to a medium, Murase, to find out what spiritual activity is really happening to them. However, after Murase clearly appears to have stumbled upon something, Ben refuses to translate what Murase says and storms out, claiming that he is a fraud.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} two hit-and-run accidents. In {{the first}} case, {{the victim was}} a 42 -year-old man. Severe lacerations were observed in the front face. Alcohol levels were 2. 9 mg/ml in the femoral venous blood, and 4. 1 mg/ml in the urine. It seemed that the victim was drunk and probably lying on the road <b>and</b> was <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> by a vehicle at night. The {{cause of death was}} profuse severe bleeding from multiple rib fractures and a crushed liver. Abraded wounds were observed {{on the back of the}} head. A tire mark was left on the victim's jacket. Rupture of the right eyeball, crush fracture of the maxilla and contused-lacerated wounds on the lips were observed. In the second case, the victim was a 16 -year-old boy. While riding a motorbike, he collided with a truck and fell off. He was <b>run</b> <b>over</b> by the truck dragged 6. 6 km, and was found dead under the truck. In the right temporal region, the skull had been rubbed flat and the right cerebral hemisphere was exposed and flattened. Severe abrasions were observed on both shoulders, buttocks and on both backs of the calves. Some abrasions were accompanied blackened necrotic tissue supposed to be caused by heat friction, and were partially worn away. The cause of death was cranial bone crush; however, hit-and-run accidents vary from case to case. These two cases are entirely different, and the two victims in this report showed severe and characteristic injuries. Our first victim had crush fractures and contused-lacerated wounds, with a tire mark on his jacket. Our second victim had deep abrasions in the right temporal region by dragging. Some of these accumulated injuries to the victim's skin by dragging might have been caused by frictional heat...|$|R
50|$|After the Padres won the National League West in 2005, Peavy {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{the key to}} upsetting the St. Louis Cardinals, whom they faced in the National League Division Series. Peavy gave up eight runs in the first game, and afterwards {{it was announced that}} he would miss {{the rest of the season}} with a broken rib, which he apparently suffered while celebrating the Padres clinching the NL West Championship. Peavy was the captain of Team USA in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, held in San Diego. He started the opening game for the U.S., a 2-0 win over Mexico, giving up just one <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> no <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> three innings. He did not factor in the decision in the second-round game against Japan, as he gave up three runs in five innings in a game that the U.S. won, 4-3.|$|R

50|$|But the Vaqueros failed from Day 1 at the Caribbean Series held in Caracas, Venezuela. Bayamón's import pitching, {{solid and}} sharp in the Puerto Rico playoffs, {{opted not to}} join the team for the trip. As a result, none of Bayamón's {{emergency}} starters in its first three games in Caracas made it past the fifth inning. It was not until Game 4 with the team 0-3 and all but mathematically eliminated from contention, that Puerto Rico won a game on a solid pitching effort. The team that Baerga built pulled out an 8-4 victory over their rivals Tigres del Licey of the Dominican Republic, with Omar Olivares allowing just four <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> two <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> seven innings of work. But {{was too late for}} Puerto Rico, whose role in the tournament would be as a spoiler for the other three teams, ending with a 2-4 record while tying for third place with the local Navegantes de Magallanes, behind Mexico's Tomateros de Culiacán (5-1) and the Dominican's Tigres del Licey (3-3).|$|R

Bullington went 9-3 {{during the regular season}} with a conference best 3.01 ERA, and was honored as a unanimous choice for MAC's Pitcher of the Year, becoming the first Cardinal to win the award. Bullington started the Cardinals opening game of the conference tournament against Miami University, but was removed in the first inning after being struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Brady Nori. The Cardinals were upset by the RedHawks 13-5. Despite his injury, Bullington came back and pitched 3 days later in their semi-final game against Kent State. He was tagged for 10 <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> 7 <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> 6 innings, taking the loss and eliminating the Cardinals from the tournament. Despite his rough finish, he ended the season with a 9-4 record and a 3.50 ERA.

Walter remained a recurring character throughout the series.

5000|$|That {{turned out}} not to be the case, as a rash of {{injuries}} opened the door for Beattie, and he made the club out of Spring training [...] He pitched 6.1 innings and gave up just one run in his major league debut to beat Hall of Famer Jim Palmer and the Baltimore Orioles. After a second win against the Chicago White Sox on May 15, Beattie lost his next seven decisions in a row. He was, however, on the mound for two of the Yankees' most important games that September. With the Yankees having been as far back as fourteen games to the Boston Red Sox on July 19, they surged to just four games back by the time they headed to Fenway Park for a four-game set from September 7 - 10. Beattie started the second game of the series, holding Boston to just three <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> no <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> his first eight innings of work. After the Red Sox scored two unearned runs in the ninth, he handed the ball over to Ron Davis for the final out. The Yankees swept the series to move into a tie with Boston.

With that the final death toll of the insurgent uprising in Mosul is an estimated 198 killed. However, other estimates are much higher and other sources say many more insurgents and civilians {{were killed in the}} battle. Actual casualty figures remain unknown. The insurgents managed to make a safe haven out of {{the western part of the}} city from where they continued to conduct <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> attacks <b>over</b> the coming months. One of the more notable attacks came just a month after the fighting ceased, when a suicide bomber dressed like an Iraqi soldier managed to get into the mess tent on an American base called Forward Operating Base Marez, and detonated himself - killing 22 people, including 14 American soldiers. The insurgent group known as Jaish Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack. The battle resulted in the city complement of security forces deserting leaving the area insecure. The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) was on their own in the city until they were able to build up the Iraqi Police and Iraqi Military presence once again.|$|R
