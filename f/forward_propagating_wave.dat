This phenomenon is used to reflect back the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave</b> which is then coupled again to the drop channels via the resonators. High transmission efficiency to the dropout channels is numerically predicted by calculations, either in two- and three-dimensional models, and analytically described by a coupled-mode theory.

We propose and explore different wavelength demultiplexer design approaches that utilize slow light concept. By altering the dielectric filling factors of each waveguide segment, one {{can show that}} different frequencies can be separated and extracted at different locations along the cascaded waveguide. Furthermore, to eliminate the inherent reflection loss of such a design, a composite structure involving a tapered waveguide with a side-coupled resonator is also presented. Such a structure features not only a <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave</b> but also a backward propagating wave acting as a feedback mechanism for the drop channels.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, the {{increasing}} potential of terahertz (THz) radiation has stimulated intensive {{efforts to develop}} efficient emitters based on the ionization of gases by ultrashort laser pulses [1]. In order to properly calibrate dedicated experiments, nonlinear propagation codes have to be particularly accurate to describe the low-frequency part of the pulse spectrum. Usually, solving full Maxwell models accounting for multiple ionization processes as well as optical and plasma nonlinear effects is computationally expensive when simulating long propagation ranges. Therefore, reduced models such as the Unidirectional Pulse Propagation Equation (uppe) [2] are often preferred, assuming that the forward propagating component conveys the {{major part of the}} laser energy. So far, no detailed numerical comparison has been performed to confirm the validity of this uppe approach, which is widely used in the scope of laser-driven THz generation [3]. Here, we examine by means of 1 D simulations the differences occurring in the THz pulse spectra and fields when these quantities are described either by a full Maxwell-fluid (maxflu) model, encompassing both backward and forward propagations, or by its uppe approximation, modeling only the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|E
40|$|Observations {{show the}} {{ubiquitous}} presence of propagating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink {{waves in the}} solar atmosphere. Waves and flows are often observed simultaneously. Due to plasma inhomogeneity in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, kink waves are spatially damped by resonant absorption. The presence of flow may affect the wave spatial damping. Here, we investigate the effect of longitudinal background flow on the propagation and spatial damping of resonant kink waves in transversely nonuniform magnetic flux tubes. We combine approximate analytical theory with numerical investigation. The analytical theory uses the thin tube (TT) and thin boundary (TB) approximations to obtain expressions for the wavelength and the damping length. Numerically, we verify the previously obtained analytical expressions {{by means of the}} full solution of the resistive MHD eigenvalue problem beyond the TT and TB approximations. We find that the backward and forward propagating waves have different wavelengths and are damped on length scales that are inversely proportional to the frequency as in the static case. However, the factor of proportionality depends on the characteristics of the flow, so that the damping length differs from its static analog. For slow, sub-Alfvenic flows the backward propagating wave gets damped on a shorter length scale than in the absence of flow, while for the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave</b> the damping length is longer. The different properties of the waves depending on their direction of propagation with respect to the background flow may be detected by the observations and may be relevant for seismological applications. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies of phonon echoes in bulk and powdered materials are reviewed. Phonon echoes {{have been observed}} in many materials such as bulk piezoelectric crystals, paramagnets, glasses, doped semiconductors, and piezoelectric, magnetic, and metallic powders, etc. The echoes arise from a time reversal of the phase, like spin echoes, of a primary pulsed acoustic excitation due to a second acoustic or rf pulse. The phase reversal occurs through the nonlinear interactions of acoustic oscillations with either themselves or electromagnetic fields. The diversing phonon echo phenomena can be classified into two general classes {{depending on the type}} of nonlinear mechanism responsible for echo formation : In parametric "field-mode" interaction systems the applied rf field of the second pulse interacts with the modes excited by the primary pulse to cause phase reversal. The echo amplitude of this class decreases monotonously with the time separation of applied two pulses, Ï. Backward and <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave</b> echoes in bulk materials belong to this class. In "anharmonic oscillator" systems different oscillation modes nonlinearly couple to one another to cause subsequent echo formation. The echo amplitude initially increases with Ï and takes a maximum before decreasing exponentially for large Ï. Only the powder echoes are in this class. In addition to these dynamic echo phenomena there are quasistatic three-pulse echoes in which phases are stored for days and years, phenomena being applicable to mass storage devices. The essential physics of phonon echo phenomena seems to be well understood although precise quantitative descriptions of each phenomenon are still required.

For the purpose of examining the microscopic loss mechanisms in dielectrics, precise measurements of the internal quality factor at different values of energy stored in the resonators are required. Here, we present a consistent method to analyze a LC superconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line. We first derive an approximate expression for the transmission S-parameter $S_{ 21 }$ based on a complete circuit model. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the internal quality factor is reliably determined by fitting the approximate form of $S_{ 21 }$. Since the voltage $V$ of the capacitor of the LC circuit is required to determine the energy stored in the resonator, we next calculate the relation between $V$ and the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>wave</b> voltage $V_{in}^+$. Due to the dependence of the quality factor on voltage, $V$ is not simply proportional to $V_{in}^+$. We find a self-consistent way to determine the relation between $V$ and $V_{in}^+$, which employs only the fitting parameters for $S_{ 21 }$ and a linear scaling factor. We then examine the resonator transmission {{in the cases of}} port reflection and impedance mismatch. We find that resonator transmission asymmetry is primarily due to the reflection from discontinuity in transmission lines. We show that our analysis method to extract the internal quality factor is robust in the non-ideal cases above. Finally, we show that the analysis method on LC resonator can be generalize to arbitrary weakly coupled lumped and distributed resonators. The generalization uses a systematic approximation on the response function based on the pole and zero which are the closest to the resonance frequency. This Closest Pole and Zero Method (CPZM) is a valuable tool for analyzing physical measurements of high-Q resonators. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|In the crustal {{waveguide}} environment, {{the major}} part of wave energy is carried by <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>waves,</b> including <b>forward</b> scattered waves.

40|$|International audienceIn optical {{parametric}} oscillators {{based on}} periodically poled (PP) non-linear quadratic materials, choosing a submicronic poling period allows generating the phase-matched signal and idler waves in opposite directions. In {{this case a}} distributed feedback mechanism is established, which enables optical parametric oscillation without the need of external mirrors or surface coatings. A backward mirrorless optical parametric oscillator (BMOPO), has been experimentally realized using a periodically-poled KTiOPO 4 (PPKTP) crystal with sub-Âµm periodicity as a quasi-phase-matched (QPM) nonlinear medium. A remarkable property of the BMOPO is the strong asymmetry in spectral bandwidth between the signal and the idler pulses: the bandwidth of the co-propagating forward wave {{is comparable to the}} pump bandwidth, whereas that of the backward wave is typically one to two orders of magnitude narrower. It has been recently demonstrated both experimentally and numerically for a pump wave exhibiting deterministic phase modulation in the PPKTP BMOPO. This property is studied here in a guided wave configuration for broad incoherent pump pulses with bandwidth up to 4. 7 THz. We demonstrate that in this case the higher the incoherence of the pump, the larger the amount of coherence transfer. The group velocities of the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>waves</b> can be perfectly matched by an appropriate waveguide profile in order to optimize the coherence transfer to the backward <b>propagating</b> <b>wave.</b> However, a nanometric QPM periodicity is required for perfect group velocity matching of the pump with the forward idler wave. Up to now such short periods have been only achieved by epitaxy in GaN. In order to have long enough waveguides we have studied this process in a PPGaN waveguide presenting stitching errors, which are very likely to occur during the fabrication process of the waveguide. We model a BMOPO in a fragmented GaN waveguide consisting of a sequence of submicronic PP elements separated by uniformly polarized connection sections representing the stitching errors. We have shown that in these fragmented waveguides the coherence transfer is nonintuitivelly almost as high as for a single piece PP waveguide because the generated coherent phase of the backscattered wave locks the phases of the <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> <b>waves</b> {{in such a way that}} the dynamics is almost insensitive to the short connection sections.

The nature of the beat instabitlity depends on beta = (v(sub sound) /v(sub A) (exp 2) and on the sense of polarization of the pump wave. The beat and decay instabilities can occur together if the pump is left-handed (i. e., ion resonant) and if beta is less than or approximately 1, but they cannot occur together if the pump is right-handed. For a left-handed pump the beat mode is the only instability if beta is greater than or approximately 1. If the pump is right-handed and beta is greater than or approximately 1, then the beat instability exists only when the pump amplitude exceeds a threshold value, and the beat will be the only instability if the pump amplitude is large enough to stabilize the modulational instability. If the pump is left-handed and beta is less than or approximately 1, then the beat mode is stabilized when the pump amplitude becomes sufficiently large. The beat instability primarily produces a <b>forward</b> <b>propagating</b> transverse <b>wave</b> in the upper sideband. Thus if beta is greater than or approximately 1, the instabilities considered here do not produce the backward <b>propagating</b> <b>waves</b> which are thought to affect turbulence and the evolution of cross helicity in the solar wind. New analytical results are presented also for the decay and modulational instabilites when beta is approximately equal to 1...|$|R
