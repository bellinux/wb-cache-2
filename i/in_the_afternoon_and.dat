5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> {{took over}} responsibility. Later, the ship Mira, {{belonging}} to Bergen Steamship Company (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, {{material from the}} Red Cross, specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and Norway Post, and journalists. The sister aircraft Najaden arrived {{later in the afternoon}} with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Wider√∏e aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the {{squadron}} patrolled the Sidi Rezegh and Gambut escarpments, driving off German tanks and infantry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> incurring vehicle and crew losses. The German column turned north during the night, attacking the divisional headquarters from the east. The four Stuart tanks repulsed the assault; 2 and 5 Troops attempted {{to regain the}} New Zealand field hospital, which had been captured the night before. They withdrew, narrowly escaping encirclement by German tanks from the 15th Panzer Division. When {{the remnants of the}} 21st Battalion were destroyed on Point 175, the New Zealand Division rear was shelled. The Italian Ariete Armoured Division attacked on 30 November and were repulsed by the divisional artillery. During the afternoon, the 24th Battalion and most of the 26th were overrun by the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). A 1991 study {{investigated}} the daily routine of the antelope and found feeding peaks at dawn, in the morning, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal), the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India), herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and male groups with two to 18 members.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E

5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> a {{break for}} rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E

5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} with over 2,200 British and American bombers attacking targets {{along the coast}} and further inland. At Gold, naval {{bombardment}} by Bombarding Force K got underway at 05:30, at which time the first waves of infantry were loading into their Landing Craft Assault (LCAs) for the run in to the beach. German defensive positions were attacked by medium and heavy bombers and by self-propelled guns on board the landing craft. Results were good at Mont Fleury Battery and at Longues, where at 07:00 Ajax and Argonaut took out of commission {{three of the four}} guns. The fourth gun resumed firing sporadically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> the garrison surrendered the following day. Two heavily casemated gun emplacements (an 88mm gun at La Rivi√®re overlooking King and a 75mm gun at Le Hamel overlooking Jig) were only lightly damaged, as they were heavily reinforced with concrete, especially on the seaward side. These positions had embrasures that permitted a wide range of enfilade fire on the beach. Four other German strong points in the immediate area were also only lightly damaged, and had to be individually assaulted as the day progressed.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{role was}} as Natasha Rostova in the 1956 film {{adaptation}} of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 1957 Hepburn starred with Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier in Billy Wilder's Love <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> with Fred Astaire {{in the musical}} film Funny Face.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 June, {{the company of the}} 6th Battalion at Nevesinje {{reported}} that rebels were gathering to attack the town; Nevesinje's Usta≈°e commissioner claimed that the rebel force numbered 5,000, and were led by a former Yugoslav Army colonel. About 10:00, the town was attacked from the south and southwest. In response, the Home Guard despatched two more companies of the 6th Battalion from Mostar to Nevesinje. That morning, reports also arrived from Bileƒáa and Stolac that rebels were approaching the village of Berkoviƒái from the north, and had captured the gendarmerie post at Gornji Lukavac. About 11:30, the Usta≈°e commissioner for Stolac reported that 3,000 Montenegrins had gathered between Nevesinje and Stolac, and he requested the immediate supply of 150 rifles for his men. A rebel attack on the gendarmerie post in the village of Divin near Bileƒáa was repulsed around midday. A platoon of Home Guard reinforcements and weapons for the Usta≈°e arrived at Stolac <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> Bileƒáa was held throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E
5|$|Stuyvesant High School {{is named}} after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch {{governor}} of New Netherland before the colony was transferred to England in 1664. The school was established in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East 23rd Street to a building designed by C. B. J. Snyder at 345 East 15th Street. The building, built in 1905 for $1.5 million, housed the Stuyvesant campus for the next 85 years. The school became renowned for excellence in math and science, and enrollment continued to grow so that by 1919, admission began to be restricted based on scholastic achievement. Stuyvesant went on a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students, with some students attending {{in the morning and}} others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until 1956.|$|E
