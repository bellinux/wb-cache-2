5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} <b>ground</b> <b>flat</b> stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
25|$|Diving masks can {{be fitted}} with lenses for divers needing optical {{correction}} to improve vision. Corrective lenses are <b>ground</b> <b>flat</b> {{on one side}} and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and {{below the surface of the}} water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard corrective lenses are available which can be fitted. Plastic self-adhesive lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask floods.|$|E

60|$|These {{reflections}} soon gave me {{the resolution}} which I had wanted at first. I was ashamed to ask the nuns for an instrument of flagellation; so I made one for myself of stout cord, pitilessly knotted at very short intervals. This done, I shut myself up while the nuns were at prayer, uncovered my shoulders, and rained such a shower of lashes on them, in the first fervour of my newly-awakened zeal, that I fairly flogged myself down on the <b>ground,</b> <b>flat</b> on my nose, before I had repeated more of the Miserere than the first two or three lines.|$|E
60|$|If {{the action}} up to then had been fast, {{it was slow}} to what followed. It seemed {{impossible}} for two strong men with one lasso, and a giant with another, to straighten out that lion. He {{was all over the}} little space under the trees at once. The dust flew, the sticks snapped, the gravel pattered like shot against the cedars. Jones ploughed the <b>ground</b> <b>flat</b> on his stomach, holding on with one hand, with the other trying to fasten the rope to something; Jim went to his knees; {{and on the other side}} of the lion, Emett's huge bulk tipped a sharp angle, and then fell.|$|E

60|$|The {{conversation}} made Dave more uneasy in mind than before. He had {{not thought}} that the red men would consider him a spy. If they continued to do that, it might go extra hard {{with him in the}} near future. Pontiac had said that the French and the English put a spy to death, but he had not added that the Indians frequently took a spy and tortured him most cruelly, yet such was a fact. Only two years before a spy had been caught by the Indians near the Great Lakes, and {{it was a matter of}} record that the red men had placed him upon the <b>ground</b> <b>flat</b> on his back and built a fire upon his breast, leaving him to burn slowly to death! The thought of this sent a cold shiver down Dave's backbone.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{hundred years}} ago, {{it would have}} some tattered skin,--of peat, of heather and dwarf whins, with the sand {{cropping}} out only here and there. So one has to figure it in Soltikof's day,--before the conies ruined it. Which was not till within the last sixty years, as appears. Kriele's Book (in 1801) still gives no hint of change: the KUHGRUND, which now has nothing but dry sand for the most industrious ruminant, is still a place of succulence and herbage in Kriele's time; 'Deep Way,' where 'at one point two carts could not pass,' was not yet blown out of existence, but has still 'a Well in it' for Kriele; HOHLE GRUND (since called Loudon's Hollow), with the Jew Hill and Jew Churchyard beyond, seem tolerable enough places to Kriele. Probably not unlike what the surrounding Country still is. A Country of poor villages, and of wild <b>ground,</b> <b>flat</b> generally, and but tolerably green; with lakelets, bushes, scrubs, and intricate meandering little runlets and oozelets; and in general with more of Forest so called than now is:--this is Kunersdorf Chain of Knolls; Soltikof's Intrenched Camp at present; destined to become very famous in the world, after lying so long obscure under Oder and its rages."

50|$|Metallurgists {{study the}} {{microscopic}} and macroscopic properties using metallography, a technique invented by Henry Clifton Sorby. In metallography, an alloy {{of interest is}} <b>ground</b> <b>flat</b> and polished to a mirror finish. The sample can then be etched to reveal the microstructure and macrostructure of the metal. The sample is then examined in an optical or electron microscope, and the image contrast provides details on the composition, mechanical properties, and processing history.|$|E

50|$|A flat {{setup is}} the most common setup used on inline skates. Almost all non-aggressive inline skates are sold with a flat wheel setup. Flat means that all the wheels touch the ground at the same time when resting on flat <b>ground.</b> <b>Flat</b> setups are not the most maneuverable but what they lack in {{maneuverability}} they make up for in speed. Flat setups are tend to be the fastest setups, compared to setups such as the HiLo or anti-rocker. Speed skaters and marathon skaters normally use flat setups. Aggressive skates are sometimes sold with flat setups, but with a small space in the middle for grinding.|$|E
