5|$|About 2.4inches (61mm) of {{rain fell}} on Yap, while <b>Koror</b> in Palau {{reported}} a 24-hour total of 1.88inches (48mm) of rain through 6a.m. UTC on July 3. The peak wind gusts reported were 53knots (98km/h, 61mph) on Yap at the Weather Service Office (WSO) in Yap and 46knots (85km/h, 53mph) at the WSO in <b>Koror.</b> During its course through the islands, Tropical Storm Ewiniar also necessitated tropical storm warnings and watches for Ngulu, Yap, <b>Koror</b> and Kayangel. No deaths in Yap or Palau were reported due to Ewiniar.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of {{civilian}} administration, the Japanese population consisted of about a few hundred individuals, and reached a little over 2,000 by 1930. The Japanese resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid-1930s onwards, and there were about 15,000 Japanese in Palau by 1938, the vast majority of whom were concentrated in <b>Koror.</b> The influx of Japanese immigrants fuelled the development of <b>Koror</b> into a city by 1939. The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the Japanese, and constituted only about 16 percent of the city's population in 1937. The Japanese made up {{more than half of the}} islands' population, as well as 27% of Micronesia's Japanese population in a 1938 census. A large minority of the Japanese populace consisted of Okinawan immigrants, as well as a few Koreans. Palau's Japanese population was repatriated after the Japanese surrender, but people of Japanese-Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau's population. A study done by the Sasakawa Pacific Island Nations Fund estimated that about 10% of Palauans are born to a Japanese father and Palauan mother, the vast majority of whom were born before 1945. Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25% of Palau's populace have some Japanese ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Vitarelli {{joined the}} Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) and was {{employed}} as a teacher on <b>Koror.</b> He was fired in 1954 during the McCarthy era on loyalty-security grounds. He was accused of associating with alleged supporters of the Communist Party USA, reading some communist publications, and {{being a member of}} the socialist American Labor Party. He eventually took this before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Vitarelli v. Seaton. Vitarelli won the case after a two-year battle and returned to Micronesia in his previous position at the TTPI.|$|E
5|$|A {{civilian}} government {{was established in}} 1922 with its headquarters at <b>Koror,</b> replacing the military administration. The {{civilian government}} initiated a programme to identify and collectivise unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment. Much of these land were used to build new industrial estates and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa. In Japan, the government actively encouraged the Japanese and Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia, including Palau, and began establishing farming settlements. The first farming settlement was established at Ngaremlengui in 1926, but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930, although later settlements were established more successfully.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive {{unemployment in the}} late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and <b>Koror.</b> Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and <b>Koror</b> that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on November27 and {{continuing}} through December3, the National Emergency Management Office in Palau issued {{more than ten}} detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare. In response, numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2. All flights to and from Roman Tmetuchl International Airport were suspended during the morning of December3. A strict curfew {{was put in place}} for the city of <b>Koror</b> {{for the duration of the}} typhoon.|$|E
5|$|On May24, 1960, a {{possible}} {{area of low pressure}} was identified {{to the west}} of <b>Koror</b> in the Republic of Palau. Tracking generally to the northwest, the system gradually developed. Despite only having winds around 30km/h (15mph), it was classified as a tropical depression early the next day and assigned the name Lucille by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Around the same time, a second, less organized low pressure system developed off the west coast of Luzon, Philippines. That system remained almost stationary over the South China Sea as Lucille accelerated northwestward. Early on May27, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it approached the Philippines. After degenerating, the remnants of Lucille moved over the Visayas.|$|E
5|$|Second and third-generation {{descendants}} of Japanese-Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind, although {{those who were}} raised in Japanese-speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in Palauan. Most retained their Japanese surnames, but Japanese-Paluans generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war. Second-generation Japanese-Palauans usually married Palauan women, and became assimilated with the local Palauan populace. In terms of self-identification, Japanese-Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on occasions when they associate with other Japanese, for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Some Japanese-Palauans also chose {{to be buried in}} Japanese cemeteries after their deaths, notably those in <b>Koror.</b>|$|E
5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} {{emphasised}} in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese nationalism and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s. Of particular note was the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at <b>Koror,</b> which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised, which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first Buddhist temple in Palau was erected in 1926, mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in <b>Koror</b> to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
25|$|Snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake is {{a popular}} {{activity}} for tourists to Palau. Several tour operators in <b>Koror</b> offer trips to the lake. Eil Malk island is approximately a 45-minute boat ride from <b>Koror.</b> The lake is accessed by a short trail from the beach on Eil Malk to the lake.|$|E
25|$|Dawson et al. also {{surveyed}} the golden jellyfish populations in three other Palauan marine lakes. They found {{significant changes in}} the medusa population in two of these lakes, Clear Lake on Eil Malk and Goby Lake on <b>Koror.</b> The golden jellyfish population in Big Jellyfish Lake, <b>Koror</b> {{did not seem to be}} affected. The reason for this was not clear, but Big Jellyfish Lake experienced lower temperature increases than the other lakes and there was experimental evidence that the golden jellyfish medusa from Big Jellyfish Lake were more tolerant of higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Koror</b> {{defeated}} Ngerbeched to win {{the first}} PML title in the team's 60-year history in 2005. The team repeated in 2006, defeating Airai in the finals. Airai took the 2007 PML championship by defeating PCC four games to two in a seven-game championship series. Ngerbeched won the 2008 PML season.|$|E
25|$|The PML {{was founded}} in 1947, with the league {{culminating}} in the All-Palau Baseball Championship. A team from Peleliu was dominant in the postwar years, winning seven titles between 1947 and 1957. Peleliu suffered a notable defeat in the 1955 All-Palau Baseball Championship to a team of students from <b>Koror</b> Intermediate School.|$|E
25|$|The {{team was}} a {{sensation}} upon its arrival in Palau, {{where they were}} hosted at the Kebtol'l Bai (double bai) in <b>Koror.</b> Bai is the local Palauan name for the steep-roofed shelter built as a meeting place for the village elders. Chiefs from all the clans in Palau were present for a feast held in the team's honor.|$|E
25|$|On Kayangel in Palau, a high {{storm surge}} damaged several houses, while strong winds downed trees. Despite residents' refusal to evacuate, no {{fatalities}} or major injuries {{took place on}} the island. Helicopters were flown to the island to survey damage and provide relief supplies. The government planned to evacuate those who were left homeless from the island. <b>Koror,</b> Babeldaob and Kayangel each lost access to water and power. In <b>Koror,</b> winds reaching as high as 120km/h (75mph) blew out rooftops and downed trees and power lines. A causeway linking an offshore hospital to the main island was temporarily shut down after being inundated by water. Tropical Storm Haiyan (31W) | date=November 7, 2013 | accessdate=November 7, 2013 | url=http://reliefweb.int/report/palau/ocha-flash-update-3-fsm-palau-tropical-storm-haiyan-31w}} On the northern end of Babeldaob, Haiyan damaged schools and buildings. Lying closest to Haiyan {{at the time of the}} typhoon's passage, Kayangel was flooded in its entirety, and all homes were destroyed. Though no people were killed there, 69 others were displaced by the storm.|$|E
25|$|Frequencies have {{increased}} since 2011 and the airline currently operates 4 to 5 flights {{a week to}} each of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong depending on the season. The airline has also served Chongqing, Chengdu, and Hangzhou, China as well as Incheon (Seoul), Korea, with seasonal services. The latest route to operate is from Hong Kong to <b>Koror,</b> Palau with twice weekly frequencies starting in mid-December, 2013.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 1950, Yuma {{departed}} San Diego, California, for Oahu {{and arrived}} in Pearl Harbor 10 days later. After {{almost two months}} of duty at Pearl Harbor, the tugboat got underway on 10 April 1950 for a mission in the Pacific Trust Territories. Based at Guam, she performed duty at Taongi Atoll and Kusaie Island in the Carolines, at <b>Koror</b> in the Palaus, and at Saipan. On 9 July 1950, she departed Guam and, four days later, arrived in Yokosuka, Japan.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, {{the first}} {{regional}} summit of all Taiwan's Pacific Island allies took place, and was hosted by Palau, in <b>Koror.</b> The meeting brought together ROC President Chen Shui-bian and delegates from the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands and Kiribati. It {{was to become}} a regular event, known as the Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit. A second regional meeting was hosted by the Marshall Islands in October, and President Chen attended. This resulted in the Majuro Declaration, in which Taiwan's six Pacific allies re-stated their recognition of the ROC's sovereignty, and promised to support the ROC's attempts to join the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Upon JTWC's {{declaration}} of Tropical Depression 31W on November 3, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Chuuk Lagoon, Losap, and Poluwat in the Federated States of Micronesia. Further west, Faraulep, Satawal, and Woleai, were placed under a typhoon watch while Fananu and Ulul were placed under a tropical storm watch. The following day, the tropical storm warning expanded to include Satawal while a typhoon warning was issued for Woleai. Much of Yap State and the islands of <b>Koror</b> and Kayangel in Palau were placed under a typhoon watch. The government issued a mandatory evacuation for Kayangel, and although most residents ignored the warning, they all survived the storm. As Haiyan progressed westward, the easternmost advisories were gradually discontinued. As Haiyan intensified into a typhoon on November 5, warnings were raised across Palau and Yap State. Government offices in Melekeok were used as an evacuation building for Palau. Despite mandatory evacuation orders, most residents on Kayangel remained {{on the island and}} rode out the typhoon.|$|E
500|$|After {{the storm}} had moved through the region on December2, {{officials}} began allowing evacuees to return home on December3. The same day, all airports and roads were re-opened; however, some roads on <b>Koror</b> remained impassable due to damage from storm surge. Additionally, electricity shut off prior to the storm was restored on <b>Koror.</b> On December5, the President of Palau {{declared a state of}} emergency and US$10million was authorized by congress for relief efforts. The Palau Red Cross Society began distributing clean-up kits and communal tools in the eastern states of Melekeok, Ngaraard, and Ngiwal by December7. Further distributions on the southern islands of Anguar and Peleliu began the following day. A week after the typhoon's passage, damage assessments across Palau had been completed and authorities had begun a large-scale reconstruction of damaged properties. The operation, known as the Bopha Catastrophe Relief Committee, was being coordinated by Dr. Patrick Tellei, president of Palau Community College. The committee planned to build 30 homes across the republic: 10 in Ngaraard and 5 each in Angaur, Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Peleliu. By December12, telecommunications and water supplies were 95percent restored while power had been brought back to 90percent of capacity. Although water had been restored to most areas by December13, residents were advised to continue boiling water, especially in more populated locales until further notice. Schools resumed classes on December17 across the republic; however, several institutions were either temporarily relocated or had half days due to damage from the storm. On December23, the Government of Palau announced that, [...] "in the holiday spirit", December24 and 31 would be declared national holidays for 2012 in light of the typhoon. In some areas, residents burned vegetative debris left behind by the storm.|$|E
500|$|On {{the main}} island of Babeldaob, the coastal states of Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Ngaraard {{reported}} {{that nearly all}} homes along the shore were damaged or destroyed by storm surge.

Rainfall at the local National Weather Service office reached [...] Water and power systems across the republic were severely disrupted, with some areas remaining without service {{more than a week}} after the storm. Two schools in Ngaraard also sustained severe damage. Despite the severity of the storm, there were no reports of casualties. Across Palau, total damage to crops and property reached U$10.1million while the cost to repair damage from the storm was estimated at US$1520million.|$|E
500|$|Upon the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's {{declaration}} of Tropical Depression 26W on November26, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for Nukuoro and Lukunor in the FSM. Hours later, the watch was superseded by a tropical storm warning while new watches were declared for Losap and Chuuk. The watch was expanded during the afternoon of November27 to include Poluwat. As the storm moved westward through the FSM and intensified on November28, a typhoon watch was issued for Woleai; tropical storm warnings for the Nomoi Islands, Poluwat, and Satawal; a tropical storm watch was also put in place for Faraulep. Throughout November29, watches and warnings were discontinued across the FSM, with all being canceled by the evening hours. During the morning of November30, the remaining advisories were discontinued; however, new typhoon watches were issued [...] for <b>Koror,</b> Ngulu Atoll, and a tropical storm watch for Yap and Sonsorol.|$|E
2500|$|The PML plays its {{games at}} the Asahi Field in <b>Koror</b> during a season lasting from January to April. No {{admission}} fee is charged for games. As of 2002 there were seven teams in the PML in one division.|$|E
