40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{studied the}} influence on hiring {{decisions of the}} nonverbal communication of female job applicants. The first experiment found ratings of the applicants 2 ̆ 7 subtle cues to be significant predictors of the hiring decisions made by college-student judges. Professional <b>employment</b> <b>interviewers</b> served as judges in the second study to cross-validate the first experiment. The third study measured the relative contributions of work histories and nonverbal behavior to hiring decisions.

40|$|Although much {{research}} regarding the employment interview {{has been published}} in professional journals, there are relatively {{few people in the}} general population who read this type of literature. Instead, the general public obtains information about the interview from popular literary sources. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to investigate the validity of the advice concerning the employment interview that is published in popular magazines and books. After a review of the popular literature, 13 hypotheses were formulated that were the result of advice offered by “experts. ” To test this advice, 19 professional <b>employment</b> <b>interviewers</b> were asked to provide data on their interviews with 96 actual job applicants. These data were compared with the score that an applicant received on his/her interview performance. The results indicated that the advice offered in popular sources was accurate more times (8) than it was inaccurate (5) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} voice quality on hiring decisions. Considering voice quality an important tool in an individual’s self-presentation in the job market, {{it may very well}} enhance his/her job prospects, while some voice qualities may affect employers’ judgments in a negative way. Five men and five women were recorded reading four different utterances representing answers to job interviewers’ questions in four different phonation guises: modal, breathy, creaky and pressed. 38 professional <b>employment</b> <b>interviewers</b> recorded the speakers’ hireability and personality ratings (likeability, self-confidence and trustworthiness) on 7 -point semantic differential scales based on the speakers’ voice. The results revealed a significant effect of the phonation guises on the speakers’ ratings with the modal voice being superior to the cluster of non-modal voices. Interestingly, the non-modal guises were evaluated in a very similar way, except for the self-confidence category with the breathy voice getting the lowest scores {{on the one hand and}} the pressed voice correlating with high self-confidence ratings on the other...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) The sign {{above the}} door reads "Counseling". Inside are four pleasant offices, decor circa 1950, and they were occupied by three people; Louise J. about to retire, who joined the Rock Company in the late forties; Joanne H. who had been counseling about three years after working for twelve years in the medical department; Papa L., retired, who came to help out. They were fine strong, caring human beings, highly respected by managers and employees and obviously capable. In June 1971 I was hired to be trained to join the counseling staff. I was exceedingly happy to get the job, a career opportunity. As a freshman in college at age 33, my long-range plan was working beautifully. Now that my children were grown I was able to step into challenging useful work. I {{was impressed by the}} people i met, the company's flexibility in hiring an old lady of 46 as a management trainee, the enlightened employee relations policies, special programs, fringe benefits and salary potential. My graduate project {{was going to be a}} rap room, Tuesday at 4 p. m., where we might not only deal with personal problems but possibly make some useful recommendations to management. Who counsels the counselor? In August 1972 I resigned due to the extraordinary workload and procedures. I enjoyed my work and my co-workers, but the job was impossible. I was a part-time counselor responsible for approximately 800 people, while doing the work of two <b>employment</b> <b>interviewers</b> hiring about fifty people a month and administering the college recruitment program on the side. The workload was less onerous than the nature of some of my assignments. I could not understand the gap between the ambitious formal counseling program and the actual treatment of employees, the incongruity between stated concerns with social responsibility and the impossible work assignments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to develop a personality-oriented job analysis measure {{that could be used to}} identify non-cognitive person attitudes relevant to a given job. One application of this new job analysis measure could be to use it within a person-job (P-J) fit predictive framework.;Three studies were conducted. The first study was aimed at testing an initial item pool developed for the personality-oriented job analysis measure and selecting the best items for each scale. The job analysis measure was constructed to assess (a) 15 personality traits measured by the Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson, 1994) and (b) 12 work values measured by the Work Values Survey (Fraboni 2 ̆ 6 Jackson, 1992). In this first study, the final scales showed adequate to high levels of homogeneity and minimum levels of scale redundancy (N = 106).;In Study 2 the new personality-oriented job analysis measure was administered to 192 workers so as to develop relatively distinct job profiles that were later used in Study 3. The inter-rater reliability of these profiles was found to be quite high. Relations of job scales with demographic variables, such as age, education, gender, and tenure, indicated that differences between judges on these variables had little effect on worker perceptions of their jobs.;In Study 3, a parallel was drawn between <b>employment</b> <b>interviewers</b> 2 ̆ 7 subjective judgments of applicants 2 ̆ 7 suitability for employment and objective measures of person-job fit. It was hypothesized that objective fit estimates would be a superior predictor of job performance and satisfaction than would subjective fit estimates. Further, it was predicted that objective fit indices would be a better predictor of job performance and satisfaction than would person variables used alone as predictors. The comparative results of Study 3 suggest that P-J fit methods utilizing profile comparison indices may not be more advantageous than the traditional multiple regression approach.;The results of the studies are interpreted as providing some evidence for the validity of the new personality-oriented job analysis measure in identifying job-relevant person attributes and in using these non-cognitive measures as predictors of job performance and satisfaction...|$|R
30|$|In the semi-structured life-story {{interviews}} {{women were}} asked to tell their life story and discuss their past, present and future and pay specific attention to the themes of health and <b>employment.</b> The <b>interviewer</b> aimed to interrupt {{as little as possible}} in order to not obstruct the natural narration of the life story, and only in order to ask for clarifications or get the interview back on track. Three women made use of an interpreter (at their request) due to their limited proficiency in Dutch. The interviews lasted from about 1 to 3  h, were audio-recorded, transcribed ad verbatim, made anonymous by using fictitious names and coded using Atlas.ti. After completing the interviews, we asked all participants to fill in the standardized and validated 13 -item Sense of Coherence Questionnaire 5 also known as the ‘Orientation to Life Questionnaire’ (Eriksson & Lindström, 2005). We used the validated translated Dutch version of the SOC- 13 (Jellesma, Terwogt, & Rieffe, 2006). Questions were answered on a 7 -point Likert scale and after reversing 6 items, possible scores varied between 13 and 91 with higher scores representing a stronger SOC (Cronbach’s α=. 92).|$|R
5000|$|Like many labor {{organizations}} of its time, the USES stated {{a belief in}} racial equality in the workplace, yet it provided fewer jobs for its African American workers. Historian Eric Arnesen from the University of Illinois argues that, “although the agency stated its general opposition to racial discrimination, it referred very few African Americans to jobs in war industries, defense training courses, or youth work-defense projects. In fact, the central administration encouraged its branches, especially in the South, to oblige employer preferences by accommodating racial discrimination.” In the Bureau of Agricultural Economics instructional manual for the USES during wartime from the 1940s, it reads that the USES policy was, “to make all referrals without regard to race, color, creed, or national origin except when an employer’s order includes these specifications which the employer {{is not willing to}} eliminate,” and if the employer had no racial preferences “but community custom or past hiring practices of the employer indicate that he may refuse to hire individuals of a particular race, color, creed, or national origin, the <b>employment</b> office <b>interviewer</b> shall ascertain whether or not he has any restrictive specifications.” ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} a {{naturally}} occurring selection process was presented and evaluated. The model included: (a) a cross-validated, empirically keyed biographical data measure, (b) applicants 2 ̆ 7 self ratings of skills and abilities relevant to the job, (c) interviewers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of applicant skills and abilities, (d) interviewers 2 ̆ 7 hiring decisions, and (e) objective measures of job performance for hired applicants. ^ The present study improved upon previous interview validity studies by using a complex battery of predictors, which was more representative of the actual information used in hiring decisions than {{would be the case}} with a single predictor. Also, a methodology was used which estimated the criterion-related validity of interviewer ratings while controlling for interviewer effects, thereby overcoming the problem of nonindependence of interviewer judgments. The model used was the generalized group effect model (Kenny, 1985). ^ Complete data were obtained for 102 Canadian life insurance sales agents who had been interviewed by one of 37 interviewers. Interviewers were managers who were normally involved in the hiring process in the agencies in which the applicants sought <b>employment.</b> ^ Significant <b>interviewer</b> effects were found for interviewer ratings. Therefore, the applicant-within-interviewer unit of analysis was used within program LEVEL (Kenny 2 ̆ 6 Stigler, 1983). Preinterview information such as biodata score and self ratings were found to have significant effects on interviewer ratings. Implications for including preinterview information when estimating interview validity were discussed. Using applicants as the unit of analysis overstated the predictivity of interviewer ratings. ^ Interviewer ratings of applicant skills and abilities were not predictive of sales commissions. However, biodata score and seven of eight self ratings were predictive of commissions. Biodata score and self ratings of three of the self ratings were positively predictive of commissions, while four of the self ratings were negatively predictive of commissions. A focus of effort phenomenon was postulated to explain the pattern of negative and positive effects of self ratings. The nonsignificant predictivity of the interviewer ratings may be attributable to direct restriction in range due to selection based on the interview. Implications for future interview research were discussed. ...|$|R
