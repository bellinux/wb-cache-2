2500|$|In cutting mode {{electrode}} {{touches the}} tissue, and sufficiently high power density {{is applied to}} vaporize its water content. Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. Energy delivery beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V) [...] to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater. Electrode surfaces intended {{to be used for}} cutting often feature a finer wire or wire loop, as opposed to a more <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> with a rounded surface.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hockey stick}} {{consists}} of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved <b>flat</b> <b>blade,</b> attached to a shaft. The curve itself has {{a big impact on}} its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong [...] "whip-back" [...] which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Smyth {{played in}} the style of a power forward, {{depending}} largely on his size and strength to contribute offensively. By positioning himself in front of the net, he earned most of his goals by tipping pucks in past the goaltender or scoring on rebounds. Relying heavily on force and determination, he did not possess particularly good shooting skills, stickhandling or skating skills. He had been known to use a two-piece stick (composite shaft with wooden blade) with a <b>flat</b> <b>blade,</b> both of which are trends which have largely gone out of date during or before Smyth's career. As a result, his success was predicated less on skill, but more on force and determination. When the Oilers drafted him out of junior, it was said that General Manager Glen Sather was looking for someone with [...] "lots of guts." [...] Smyth was also known as a leader, having served as captain for Canada's World Championship teams on six occasions, as well as an alternate captain on all of the teams he played with in the NHL.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an old Turk," [...] he replied, {{drawing the}} <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> of his knife between his teeth, thereby {{producing}} a whetting, grating sound.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{the sun was shining}} from a blue, blue sky, but the shadows were deadly cold, and the wind like a <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> of ice. We went out running to the sun. The hotel could not give us coffee and milk: only a little black coffee. So we descended to the sea-front again, to the Via Roma, and to our café. It was Friday: people seemed to be bustling in from the country with huge baskets.|$|E
5000|$|St. Augustine is a {{dark green}} grass with broad, <b>flat</b> <b>blades.</b> It spreads by {{aboveground}} stolons, commonly known as [...] "runners", and forms a dense layer.|$|R
50|$|Nasal specula {{have two}} {{relatively}} <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> with handle. The instrument is hinged {{so that when}} the handles are squeezed together the blades spread laterally, allowing examination.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments concerning the behavior of several types of impellers regarding the depression formatted and operating in a specific range of rotations. Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R

See," [...] and I held up the Winchester repeater; [...] "here is {{a hollow}} staff that shall enable thee to kill even as we kill, only I lay this charm upon it, thou shalt kill no man with it. If thou liftest it against a man, it shall kill thee. Stay, I will show thee. Bid a soldier step forty paces and place the shaft of a spear in the ground so that the <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> looks towards us." ...|$|E

2500|$|All NEMA 1 {{devices are}} {{two-wire}} non-grounding devices (hot-neutral) rated for 125V maximum. 1-15P plugs have two parallel <b>flat</b> <b>blades,</b> [...] wide, [...] thick, [...] long, and spaced [...] apart.|$|R
5000|$|... 15th century swords, {{often for}} one-handed use though two-handed {{examples}} exist, with broad <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> of hexagonal cross-section, nearly parallel edges (little profile taper), narrow fullers, and a pronounced ricasso.|$|R
5000|$|Toilet Plunger (Dickson {{says the}} <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and square {{blending}} chamber pull food into the blender, {{so there is}} no need for spoons, spatulas, or plungers. He then proceeds to blend a plunger.) ...|$|R
50|$|The two {{tools are}} {{combined}} {{on the same}} end, {{so that they are}} on the same sheet of metal. The rake is very coarse, so can only be used for raking coarse material. The hoe is a <b>flat</b> <b>blade,</b> {{that can be used to}} scrape and dig.|$|E
5000|$|Pickaxe: An axe {{with a large}} pointed end, {{rather than}} a <b>flat</b> <b>blade.</b> Sometimes exists as a double-bladed tool with a pick {{on one side and}} an axe or adze head on the other. Often used to break up hard material, such as rocks or concrete.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sticking}} knife usually {{consists of a}} double edge pointed blade approximately six inches long. Blades are traditionally made of high carbon steel (such as 1095). Handles are simple, consisting usually of two hardwood scales riveted through the full, <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> tang. Sticking knives generally lack any kind of guard.|$|E
50|$|Early spurtles were flat, wooden {{or metal}} instruments, with long handles and <b>flat</b> <b>blades.</b> The spatula-like utensils, known as 'Couthie Spurtle's, {{can be used}} for {{flipping}} oatcakes or making pancakes - but not for making porridge.|$|R
50|$|All NEMA 1 {{devices are}} {{two-wire}} non-grounding devices (hot-neutral) rated for 125 V maximum. 1-15P plugs have two parallel <b>flat</b> <b>blades,</b> 1/4 in wide, 0.06 in thick, 5/8 - 23/32 in long, and spaced 1/2 in apart.|$|R
50|$|Turbines (<b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> or pitched blades) which {{inlet flow}} is axial and outlet flow is radial will provide shearing, {{turbulence}} and need approximately 20 time {{more energy than}} propellers, for the same diameter and same rotation speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} way to {{determine}} when the curd is set is by inserting a <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> at a 45-degree angle into the curd and raising it slowly. If the curd breaks cleanly leaving a glassy fracture, it is ready for cutting. In a large Cheddar-manufacturing facility, this may also be tested using a viscometer.|$|E
50|$|Taiaha {{are usually}} between 5 to 6 ft in length. It has three main parts; the arero (tongue), used for {{stabbing}} the opponent and parrying; the upoko (head), the {{base from which}} the tongue protrudes; and the ate (liver) or tinana (body), the long <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> which is also used for striking and parrying.|$|E
50|$|Spiralizers usually contain three blades: a round blade for spaghetti, a small <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> for ribbons, {{and a large}} wide blade for spiral strands. Vegetables are {{clamped between}} the blade and crank. As the handle turns {{with a bit of}} pressure, the {{vegetable}} is pressed between the turning handle and the blade, which cuts it into spirals.|$|E
50|$|This slender, vivid green {{plant has}} long, <b>flat</b> <b>blades.</b> It grows in large clumps or beds exposed during low tide and {{submerged}} at high tide. It is found attached to {{rocks in the}} middle to low intertidal zones.|$|R
50|$|Backward {{inclined}} - These {{fans have}} simple <b>flat</b> <b>blades,</b> backwardly inclined {{to match the}} velocity pattern of the air passing through the fan wheel for high-efficiency operation. These fans are typically used in high-volume, relatively low-pressure, clean air applications.|$|R
25|$|A cutter mattock has a {{head that}} {{combines}} an axe and adze. Thus, {{it has two}} <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> that are opposite of each other, with one blade rotated 90° relative to the other. The adze blade is designed for cutting roots.|$|R
50|$|A khurpa {{is a short}} handled {{cutting tool}} with a <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> used for digging soil and weeding in small gardens or {{vegetable}} farms. It is commonly use in small farms or in ridges or rows of vegetables to hoewing or earth up the weeds. It is traditionally used while in a squatting posture. The work khurpa is word of Punjabi language.|$|E
5000|$|Oars have {{traditionally}} been made of wood. The form is a long shaft (or loom) with a <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> on the end. Where the oar connects to the boat there is a [...] "collar" [...] which stops the oar slipping past the rowlock. Oars usually have a handle about 150mm long, which may be a material sleeve or alternatively an ovoid shape carved to fit the hands.|$|E
5000|$|Yari ("spear"): A spear, or spear-like polearm. Yari have various blade forms, from {{a simple}} double edged and <b>flat</b> <b>blade,</b> to a {{triangular}} cross section double edged blade, to those with a symmetric cross-piece (jumonji-yari) or those with an asymmetric cross piece. The main blade is symmetric and straight unlike a naginata, and usually smaller but can be as large or bigger than some naginata blades.|$|E
2500|$|Early axial {{compressors}} offered poor efficiency, so {{poor that}} in the early 1920s a number of papers claimed that a practical jet engine would be impossible to construct. Things changed after A. A. Griffith published a seminal paper in 1926, noting that the reason for the poor performance was that existing compressors used <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and were essentially [...] "flying stalled". He showed that the use of airfoils instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> would increase efficiency to the point where a practical jet engine was a real possibility. He concluded the paper with a basic diagram of such an engine, which included a second turbine that was used to power a propeller.|$|R
50|$|The Rushton turbine is a {{radial flow}} {{impeller}} used for many mixing applications (commonly for gas dispersion applications). The design {{is based on}} a flat disk with vertical <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> vertically mounted. Recent innovations include the use of concave or semi-circular blades.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{device with}} wires of {{specific}} diameter instead of <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> {{is used to}} set the gap in spark plugs to the correct size; this is done by increasing or decreasing the gap until the gauge of the correct size just fits inside the gap.|$|R
