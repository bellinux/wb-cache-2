5000|$|John Hicklenton (8 May 1967 - 19 March 2010), aka John <b>Deadstock,</b> was a British comics artist {{best known}} for his brutal, visceral work on {{flagship}} 2000 AD characters like Judge Dredd (in particular Heavy Metal Dredd) and Nemesis the Warlock during the eighties and nineties.|$|E
50|$|Most vintage {{clothing}} {{has been}} previously worn, but {{a small percentage of}} pieces have not. These are often old warehouse stock, and more valuable than those that have been worn, especially if they have their original tags. Referred to as <b>deadstock</b> or new old stock (NOS), they nevertheless sometimes have flaws. Vintage clothing may be either commercially produced or handmade by individuals.|$|E
50|$|The sneakerhead {{subculture}} {{originated in}} America {{during the late}} 1980s and had gone global {{by the end of}} the 1990s. Hardcore sneaker collectors in Britain, Europe, and the US buy online and go to outlets, sneaker events, swapmeets, parties, and gatherings in search of rare, <b>deadstock,</b> vintage, and limited edition shoes to invest in. Originally popular among urban black youth and teenage white skateboarders, by the 21st century, it had also gained a sizeable Asian following especially in Malaysia, India, and China.|$|E

He did other work with Mills including a strip in the now defunct CoolBeansWorld site. He also drew ZombieWorld (as John <b>Deadstock)</b> for Dark Horse Comics, who commissioned him because, as Mills has said [...] "John is the ultimate horror artist ... I defy anyone to show me an artist whose monsters are more grotesque, whose zombies have a more ghastly look in their eye." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cultured meat {{has often}} {{featured}} in science fiction. The earliest mention {{may be in}} Two Planets (original German title: Auf Zwei Planeten) (1897) by Kurd Lasswitz, where [...] "synthetic meat" [...] {{is one of the}} varieties of synthetic food introduced on Earth by Martians. Other notable books mentioning artificial meat include Ashes, Ashes (1943) by René Barjavel; The Space Merchants (1952) by Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980) by Douglas Adams; Neuromancer (1984) by William Gibson; Oryx and Crake (2003) by Margaret Atwood; <b>Deadstock</b> (2007) by Jeffrey Thomas; Ware Tetralogy by Rudy Rucker; and Divergent (2011) by Veronica Roth.|$|E
5000|$|Some sources derive [...] "farm" [...] {{with its}} French version ferme, most notably {{used in the}} context of the Fermiers Generaux, from the mediaeval Latin firma, meaning [...] "a fixed agreement, contract", {{ultimately}} from the classical Latin adjective firmus, firma, firmum, meaning [...] "firm, strong, stout, steadfast, immoveable, sure, to be relied upon". [...] The modern agricultural sense of the word stems from the same origin, in that a medieval land-"holder" [...] (none [...] "owned" [...] land but the king himself under his allodial title) under feudal land tenure might let it (i.e. lease it out) under a contract as a going concern (not as a sub-infeudated fee), that is to say as a unit producing a revenue stream, together with its workers, livestock and <b>deadstock</b> (i.e. implements), for exploitation by a tenant who was licensed by the contract, or firma, to keep all the revenue he could extract from the holding in exchange for fixed rents. Thus the rights to the revenue stream produced by the land had been farmed by the lessor (therefore strictly perhaps the [...] "farmor") and the tenant became the [...] "holder of the farm", or to coin a word, [...] "farmee". Because this was the form of the farming transaction most known to popular society, the word [...] "farmer" [...] became synonymous with a tenant of an agricultural holding.|$|E
50|$|The Science of Imagination was {{the theme}} of the second festival, {{sponsored}} by Manchester School of Art and supported by Manchester City Council, G. F Smith and Design Week. DM14 featured 16 events over ten days, including an exhibition of Dress of Glass and Flame by designer and artist Helen Storey RDI at Manchester Art Gallery as a joint event with the Manchester Science Festival. Adidas SPEZIAL, an exhibition of 650 pairs of rare, vintage, <b>deadstock,</b> re-issues and collaboration styles from the personal collections of numerous collectors of adidas trainers, curated by Gary Aspden, attracted wide media interest and thousands of visitors. ARTOMATIC founder Tim Milne gave a talk on “Materials in the Digital Age” at the Special Collections Gallery. The Design Manchester Conference, again held at Manchester Town Hall, featured Adrian Shaughnessy and Tony Brook of Unit Editions; Technology Will Save Us’ Daniel Hirschman; Brazilian designer Rejane Dal Bello; designer and artist Rob Lowe aka Supermundane; retail experience and interaction designer Ross Phillips of Dalziel & Pow; and Michael C Place of Leeds-based creative agency Build. DM14 saw Manchester’s first annual Great Design Debate, at Manchester School of Art, on the topic “North: the role of the creative industries as a catalyst for growth” in the newly minted Northern Powerhouse.

40|$|Despite {{estimates}} that the global butterfly trade generates over US$ 100 million annually in sales of pupae for exhibitions and <b>deadstock</b> {{for a range of}} collector and artisanal uses, almost no research has been conducted that unpacks the dynamics of these value chains. This paper remedies this gap by highlighting the governance structure of the value chain, with important implications on the benefits for chain participants, upgrading strategies, sectoral sustainability, and the potential for new market entrants. Our research on live butterfly chains reveals the fragility of current modes of economic organization that promote overproduction as threatening the long-term viability for the industry as a whole. We propose an alternative governance model based on the use of individually transferrable quotas, or ITQs, as a means of improving the performance of certain butterfly value chains...|$|E
40|$|In a {{personal}} essay, Ida Hattemer-Higgins describes {{the discovery of}} a decrepit store in Athens brimming with designer <b>deadstock</b> from decades past. The clothes she finds therein are the stuff of dreams for any fashion enthusiast, as is the store itself, a dim, forgotten place where garments are concealed like buried treasure under layers of dust, and where the author herself drifts into a state of semi-consciousness. What Hattemer-Higgins describes is the sensual pleasure of finding beautiful clothes, and the future self that she imagines being when she wears them. This article considers the relationship between the garments we wear and the selves we imagine into them in trying them on, buying them, and wearing them in every day life. These modalities are explored through a phenomenological discussion of dress, with reference to Hattemer-Higgins’s essay as well as my own lived experience of dressing...|$|E
40|$|In The Unseen – An Atlas of Infrared Plates, British {{documentary}} photographer Edward Thompson set out {{to explore}} the boundaries of our perception. Inspired by the various uses of infrared film throughout history, he has gathered an extensive archive of work {{using some of the}} last <b>deadstock</b> rolls of Kodak Aerochrome Infrared film ever made. Colour infrared film had over 1, 800 documented uses; in this book a dozen of them have been expanded upon, pushing the purposes and properties of the film to its scientific and conceptual limits. From aerial photographs of London to still life photography of vital organs, landscape photography and nude portraiture, the book covers a vast range of photographic tropes. The projects have come together within the book to create a wider narrative that questions the nature of our reality, our past and what could be our future. The Unseen is a swan song to the medium of colour infrared film photography, of which this book has also become an artefact, a part of its history...|$|E
40|$|Inventory {{control is}} a process that is vital to the company 2 ̆ 7 s operations, with the aim to prevent the company from stock-outs and to keep costs as optimally as {{possible}} to the activities related to the provision. PT. Semen Indonesia as a national cement company in Indonesia has a problem in controlling inventory, including inventory value that exceeds the target, the value of <b>deadstock</b> which reached Rp. 80, 000, 000, and the number of items that reached 52, 700 items. MUSIC 3 D method is an approach that can overcome the problems of inventory control in PT. Semen Indonesia. This method is a theory to group items based on several aspects. In this study, only three elements in MUSIC 3 D are applied, which are ABC analysis (value based), SDE (lead time), and FSN (consumption rate) with the sample as many as 990 types of goods. The results show that the type of CDN products is goods that dominate in the warehouse of PT. Semen Indonesia, with the following characteristics: C (low price with the high volume of quantity), D (lead time < 6 months) and N (not used < 1 year) with the percentage reached 32...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{management and}} operational functions, recommended by feed-company personnel and swine producers, {{that have the}} potential to decrease the risk of pathogens being transmitted among swine farms through movement of feed trucks. Materials and methods: Focus groups and key-informant interviews were conducted with feed company representatives (21), including managers, dispatchers, and truck drivers, and also with swine producers (15). Questions explored biosecurity measures that would reduce risk of pathogen transmission at the farm, feed-company, and feed-truck levels. Participants were asked to rate these biosecurity management changes by economic and logistic feasibility and likelihood of reducing pathogen transmission. Results: The results provide an understanding of the roles of the farm, feed truck, and feed company in biosecurity management surrounding delivery of feed to swine farms and the need for education about how pathogens move among farms. Examples include pest control and truck washing, dispatching trucks according to farm disease status, drivers not entering the barn, reducing exposure of trucks to <b>deadstock</b> and manure, and educating all industry personnel. Implications: All swine industry personnel must think about their roles in pathogen transmission associated with feed delivery and consider implementing changes and developing an industry standard that could reduce this risk. Veterinarians may take the responsibility of educating others in the industry about risks identified in the scientific literature that are associated with pathogen transmission. Biosecurity is everyone’s concern: everyone has a role to play in reducing the potential risk...|$|E
40|$|Blood meal, {{meat and}} bone meal. and feather meal {{are high in}} escape protein, {{relative}} to oil meals and forages. and increase performance when included in forage-based diets sufficient in rumen degradable protein. Two factors that influence the nutritive value of animal byproduct meals are processing conditions and raw materials. Renderers apply heat to drive off moisture. extract fat. and eliminate bacterial contamination from animal tissues. This cooking also denatures proteins. creating cross links and insoluble bonds within and between protein chains: enhancing resistance to microbial degradation in the rumen. However. processing at very high temperatures can limit the extent of enzymatic breakdown of proteins, reducing digestibility and absorption in the small intestine. Variable inputs (<b>deadstock,</b> tankage, meat trimmings and bones) contribute to the great diversity encountered in commercial meat and bone meals. Concentration of meat and bone meal components. specifically bone. hair, and lean tissues. influence protein quantity and quality. Bone content, exhibited through ash, is negatively correlated with crude protein, whereas hair is high in protein but poorly digested. Animal performance with meat and bone meal supplementation has been inconsistent, and may result from inadequate escape protein and(or) poor protein digestibility arising from raw materials or processing conditions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine how processing temperature and composition of animal byproduct meals influence in vivo true protein digestibility and escape protein concentrations. and to compare in situ and in vitro ammonia release techniques for measuring escape protein...|$|E
40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{considered}} {{in detail the}} range of biosecurity practices undertaken on cattle farms, particularly within the UK. In this study, 56 cattle farmers in a 100 km 2 area of north-west England were questioned regarding their on-farm biosecurity practices, including those relating to animal movements, equipment sharing and companies and contractors visiting the farms. Methodology/Principal Findings: There was great variation between farms {{in terms of the}} type of, and extent to which, biosecurity was carried out. For example, the majority of farmers did not isolate stock bought onto the farm, but a small proportion always isolated stock. Many farmers administered treatments post-movement, primarily vaccinations and anthelmintics, but very few farms reported carrying out any health checks after moving animals on. In addition, there appeared to be much variation in the amount of biosecurity carried out by the different companies and contractors visiting the farms. <b>Deadstock</b> collectors and contracted animal waste spreaders, although likely to have a high potential for contact with infectious agents, were reported to infrequently disinfect themselves and their vehicles. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that although certain biosecurity practices are undertaken, many are carried out infrequently or not at all. This may be due to many factors, including cost (in time and money), lack of proven efficacies of practices and lack of relevant education of veterinary surgeons, producers and other herd health specialists. Further research exploring the reasons for the lack of uptake is imperative if preventive medicine is to be utilised fully by the farming industry...|$|E
