25|$|By {{assuming}} {{only one}} {{program would be}} running at a time, the engineers were able to ignore the concept of reentrancy; the ability for a program (or library) to be stopped at any point, asked to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> {{and then return to}} the original task. In the case of QuickDraw for example, this means the system can store state information internally, like the current location of the window or the line style, knowing it would only change under control of the running program. Taking this one step further, the engineers left most of this state inside the application rather than in QuickDraw, thus eliminating the need to copy this data between the application and library.|$|E

If there are gigs on the weekdays, she does the {{schoolwork}} as homework. She has mentioned in interviews that math, PE, and sewing are her favorite subjects in school. She regards her education as important, as it will allow her to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> if the music doesn't work out or if she doesn't want to sing anymore; she has said that she wants to sing {{as long as it is}} fun. She has mentioned hairdressing as her future dream hobby. Despite her gigs, she has time to have holidays and she says the entertainment business hasn't been harsh on her. Her manager-father deals with the business side, and her parents support her in her career.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox.

I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the good things that could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series: [...] "After watching Joe [...] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I {{would never want to}} produce a show of my own." [...] However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: [...] "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> It has been pretty rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E
500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom I {{have to work}} with before I go onto another career or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> usually also implies not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and, not <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> often implies <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, Ishihara stated that Gold and Silver started development right after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime's [...] Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with Pokémon Stadium and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate {{was taken over by}} Pokémon Yellow. Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought that once we entered the twenty-first century, it would be time for me to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, an off-off-Broadway company named The Hourglass Group {{produced}} {{an adaptation of}} The Beebo Brinker Chronicles in a production that ran for a month. The writers used material from I Am a Woman, Women in the Shadows and Journey to a Woman to predominantly positive reviews. It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted {{to make it more}} appealing by turning to camp for comedy. However, one of the writers said, [...] "I just felt like, how can you turn these people into a joke? I mean, these people are real people! Why would I direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous? We are allowed to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> besides camp." [...] The stage adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner, and it won the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award for [...] "fair, accurate, and inclusive" [...] portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater. In April 2008, Bannon appeared with the Seattle Women's Chorus in a performance called [...] "Vixen Fiction". Bannon read excerpts of her work and discussed the effects of her writing on her own life and the lives of her readers. U.S. cable network HBO has optioned Bannon's novels for potential development as a series.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, the IMAX Corporation {{announced}} that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D. Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else. Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it." [...] However, Feige clarified, [...] "There will be a tag [...] But there's not a post––credit scene." ...|$|E
