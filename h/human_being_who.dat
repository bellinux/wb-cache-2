25|$|But by {{your hard}} and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for {{yourself}} {{on the day of}} wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>who</b> does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.

25|$|The {{religions}} both share {{a belief}} in the virgin birth of Jesus, his miracles and healings, and that he ascended bodily into heaven. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he was a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>who</b> was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. They believe in God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' crucifixion. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never assumed human flesh, they do not accept the use of icons, and see this as shirk (idolatry). Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of iconoclasm and their conquests caused the iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to Muhammad, Jesus, or any other prophets; only to God.|$|E

Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E

The {{organisation}} continued to flourish long after Alice's death, and in 1953, her grandson Louis, Earl Mountbatten of Burma gave a lecture on the hospital. He spoke highly of Alice, saying [...] " [...] the point of departure always remained a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>who</b> was ill and needed help, and his needs in war and peace. At his side stood the person willing to give help, wishing to ameliorate his needs and for this purpose could make use of an organisation which was {{becoming more and more}} streamlined." [...] Among Alice's other establishments were the Alice Society for Women's Training and Industry, for the purpose of educating women, and the Princess Alice Women's Guild, an organisation devoted to training nurses. These organisations were especially active and important during the Austro-Prussian war, but the time Alice dedicated to them annoyed her husband, who saw them as consuming his wife's time at his expense.|$|E

40|$|Tom Regan {{argues that}} <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and some {{non-human}} animals have moral rights {{because they are}} “subjects of lives,” that is, roughly, conscious, sentient beings with an experiential welfare. A prominent critic, Carl Cohen, objects: he argues that only moral agents have rights and so animals, since they are not moral agents, lack rights. An objection to Cohen’s argument is that his theory of rights seems to imply that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> are not moral agents have no moral rights, but since these <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have rights, his theory of rights is false, and so he fails to show that animals lack rights. Cohen responds that this objection fails because <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> are not moral agents nevertheless are the “kind” of <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> are moral agents and so have rights, but animals are not that “kind” of being and so lack rights. Regan argues that Cohen’s “kind” arguments fail: they fail to explain why <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> are not moral agents have rights and they fail to show that animals lack rights. Since Cohen’s “kind” arguments are influential, I review and critique Regan’s objections. I offer suggestions for stronger responses to arguments like Cohen’s...|$|R

500|$|Singin' and Swingin opens {{shortly after}} Angelou's {{previous}} autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. Marguerite, or Maya, {{a single mother}} with a young son, is in her early twenties, struggling to make a living. Angelou writes in this book, like her previous works, about {{the full range of}} her own experiences. As scholar Dolly McPherson states, [...] "When one encounters Maya Angelou in her story, one encounters the humor, the pain, the exuberance, the honesty, and the determination of a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>who</b> has experienced life fully and retained her strong sense of self". Many people around Angelou influence her growth and—as critic Lyman B. Hagen states—"propel Angelou ever forward". The book's opening chapters find Maya concerned with, as Hagen asserts, [...] "apprehension about her son, a desire for a home, and facing racial conflicts, and seeking a career". Maya is offered a job as a salesgirl in a record shop on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. At first she greets her boss' offers of generosity and friendship with suspicion, but after two months of searching for evidence of racism, Maya begins to [...] "relax and enjoy a world of music". The job allows her to move back into her mother's house and {{to spend more time with}} her son.|$|E

500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>who</b> was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E

500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair is at work, Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer.
