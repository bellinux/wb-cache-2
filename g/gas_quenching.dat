50|$|Recently, high {{pressure}} <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> {{has become more}} popular for several reasons: it is more environmentally friendly, {{the flow of the}} gas is easier to control than the flow of oil in a quench press, and a single machine with low pressure carburizing and high-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> replaces the three machines of a carburizing furnace, an atmosphere furnace, and a quench press.|$|E
50|$|In general, gas {{carburizing}} is {{used for}} parts that are large. Liquid carburizing {{is used for}} small and medium parts and pack carburizing {{can be used for}} large parts and individual processing of small parts in bulk. Vacuum carburizing (low pressure carburizing or LPC) can be applied across a large spectrum of parts when used in conjunction with either oil or high pressure <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> (HPGQ), depending on the alloying elements within the base material.|$|E
50|$|Carbonitriding {{is similar}} to gas {{carburization}} {{with the addition of}} ammonia to the carburizing atmosphere, which provides a source of nitrogen. Nitrogen is absorbed at the surface and diffuses into the workpiece along with carbon. Carbonitriding (around 850 °C / 1550 °F) is carried out at temperatures substantially higher than plain nitriding (around 530 °C / 990 °F) but slightly lower than those used for carburizing (around 950 °C / 1700 °F) and for shorter times. Carbonitriding tends to be more economical than carburizing, and also reduces distortion during quenching. The lower temperature allows oil quenching, or even <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> with a protective atmosphere.|$|E

5000|$|Not all of {{the fuel}} is {{completely}} consumed by the combustion process; {{a small amount of}} fuel is present after combustion, and some of it reacts to form oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, or hydrocarbons not originally present in the input fuel mixture. Incomplete combustion usually results from insufficient oxygen to achieve the perfect stoichiometric ratio. The flame is [...] "quenched" [...] by the relatively cool cylinder walls, leaving behind unreacted fuel that is expelled with the exhaust. When running at lower speeds, quenching is commonly observed in diesel (compression ignition) engines that run on natural <b>gas.</b> <b>Quenching</b> reduces efficiency and increases knocking, sometimes causing the engine to stall. Incomplete combustion also leads to the production of carbon monoxide (CO). Further chemicals released are benzene and 1,3-butadiene that are also hazardous air pollutants.|$|E

40|$|For {{quenching}} of age hardenable {{aluminum alloys}} today predominantly aqueous quenching media are used, {{which can lead}} due to the Leidenfrost phenomenon to a non-uniform cooling of the parts and thus to distortion.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} learn gas flow state in the vacuum high {{pressure}} <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> furnace, this paper simulates and tests the gas flow under the no-loaded and cold state. Hot wire anemometer is {{used to measure the}} speeds of some feature points, on the one hand to provide boundary conditions for the numerical simulation, {{and on the other hand}} to compare with the numerical simulation results. FLUENT software is used to simulate the gas flow of nozzle-type vacuum high-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> furnace. The results show that at the center of the furnace appears high-pressure low-speed zone in which is resulted by the gas collision there, and the vortex also appears in the area around the furnace. The results mean that the cooling rate of works will be slow there. Different exit velocities of five nozzles cause the uneven flow distribution, which will affect the cooling uniformity of works. The comparison between the simulation results and the measured results shows that the error is within 10 %.

40|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>quenching</b> {{has been}} known for centuries as a convenient, {{affordable}} method to heat treat ferrous alloys. Heated parts are taken out of the furnace and quenched at ambient pressure, casually using a blower to increase the heat exchange. Technical developments in the metal industry, over the last decades, have seen a constant improvement of the ratio of heat exchange, e. g. by using pressured chambers, specific blowers, and a variety of gases and gas mixtures. The current <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> technologies are adapted to heat treatable metals found in the automotive industry, requesting a minimum heat exchange ratio, also depending on the part geometry. Little has been however investigated concerning the quenched batch, defined as the arrangement of the heated parts onto a single- or multiple-layer charge carrier. The present work, through a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, provides guidelines to adapt the batch to a specific gas flow pattern (spatial fitting), and to adapt the gas flow pattern to the batch structure (temporal fitting). Measurement techniques have been developed to assess the flow patterns inside industrial quenching chambers. Evaluated flow structures have been converted to numerical boundary conditions for extended simulations tools. Simulations have helped implementing technical solutions for flow correction in industrial <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> chambers. Furthermore, simulations have served the design of batches of various geometries, to improve both quenching homogeneity and intensity. Both experimental and numerical results confirmed the advantages of <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> for the homogeneous heat treatment of automotive steel grades, and demonstrated the potential of various flow correcting devices, such as perforated plates and cylindrical flow ducts. Heat treatment gas and spray quenching has also been integrated into the forging and the turning process chains of single components, successfully optimizing the lean process flow (automation, quality, and time), for various high-performance materials and part geometries...|$|E

A numerical {{analysis of a}} vacuum <b>gas</b> <b>quenched</b> die block made of H 13 was carried out utilising a nonlinear thermoelastic-plastic stress model together with the fluid flow and thermal profiles within the furnace. Simulation procedures for stress behaviour of the die were developed for both direct quench and marquench processes.

Simulation of the cooling rates at the surface and core of the die during marquenching correlated well with the experimental data. Further stress simulation indicated that the final thermal distortion and residual stresses in the die after direct quenching were larger than those due to marquenching.

40|$|During <b>gas</b> <b>quenching,</b> {{independent}} process parameters {{include the}} preheat {{temperature of the}} component and {{the temperature of the}} circulated gas. One of the most important dependent process parameters is the heat transfer coefficient between the component and the circulated gas. The heat transfer coefficient has significant influence on the quenching results, such as distortion, residual stresses, and hardness distribution. Large distortions after quenching will increase the cost due to the post-quenching processes, such as the grinding and hot rectification. The objective in this research is to minimize the distortion caused by quenching. In this paper, the surface of a component is divided into several regions, and different values of the heat transfer coefficient are imposed on each region. Constraints on the residual stresses and surface hardness distribution are imposed to improve the service properties. The heat transfer coefficients are ideal design variables to optimize the <b>gas</b> <b>quenching</b> process.
