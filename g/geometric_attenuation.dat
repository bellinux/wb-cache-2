Our data set consists of 45 Pyrenean events with magnitude 2. 7 to 5. 4, recorded at distances from 15 to 200 km, for which about 600 displacement spectra could be computed. We {{assume that the}} far-field displacement spectrum {{is the product of}} source, propagation, and site effects. S-wave displacement spectra are computed for accelerometric and velocimetric records using fast Fourier transforms by integration in the frequency domain for 0. 5 – 15 Hz. Owing to the velocimeter response, the spectra may be unreliable below 1 Hz. A Brune-type source is assumed. Attenuation is decomposed into a frequency-dependent term (anelastic attenuation) and a non-frequency-dependent term (<b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation).</b> Adapting a process proposed by Scherbaum and Wyss (1990), we invert the data with a two-step regression. The first step recovers the <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation,</b> the seismic moment, and a frequency-independent scaling factor.

Our results show that the propagation term includes a slightly superspheric <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation</b> that varies as 1 /r 1. 2 and an anelastic attenuation that cannot be safely resolved with a linear approach.

40|$|Abstract Regional {{distance}} P and S waves behave differently with propagation distance due {{to complex}} elastic and anelastic {{effects in the}} crustal wave guide and uppermost mantle. It is well recognized that seismological discriminants based on P/S ratios or individual phase spectral ratios must be corrected for regionally depen-dent path effects for successful discrimination to be achieved.

However, large scatter persists in distance-corrected discriminants, which degrades their per-formance, and strategies are needed to further reduce the scatter by accounting for individual path variability. We demonstrate that characterizing some of the path variability by the readily measured surface topographic roughness along each path allows reduction of the scatter in some regional discriminants.

Amplitude ratios of regional phases comprised mainly of P-wave energy (Pn, Pg) to those comprised mainly of S-wave energy (Sn, Lg) effectively discriminate between explosions and earthquakes in many regions, particularly at frequencies higher than 3 Hz. At lower frequencies, discrimination is usually poor due to large scatter that causes overlapping of event populations. Scatter in regional discriminant measures such as Pg/Lg ratios is caused by both source and propagation effects, and reducing the scatter imparted by the latter is essential to improving the discriminant performance when events do not share identical paths. Regional phases experience distance-dependent amplitude variations due to effects uch as critical angle ampli-fication, <b>geometric</b> spreading, and <b>attenuation.</b> Discriminant measures are usually corrected for empirically determined distance trends for a given region, but large scatter persists after such corrections.

40|$|ABSTRACT—We report {{parametric}} {{studies of}} elastic wave generation by a pulsed laser and associated spalling of thin surface films by the corresponding high stresses. Two dif-ferent substrate materials, single crystal Si (100) and fused silica, are considered. Spallation behavior of Al thin films is in-vestigated {{as a function}} of substrate thickness, film thickness, laser energy, and various parameters governing the source. Surface displacement due to the stress wave is measured by Michaelson interferometry and used to infer the stresses on the film interface. Consistent with previous studies, the maxi-mum stress in the substrate and at the film/substrate interface increases with increasing laser fluence. For many of the con-ditions tested, the substrate stress is large enough to damage the Si. Moreover, the maximum interface stress is found to increase with increasing film thickness, but decrease with in-creasing substrate thickness due to <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation.</b> Of particular significance is the development of a decompres-sion shock in the fused silica substrates, which results in very high tensile stresses at the interface.

30|$|Forecasting the {{evolution}} of the main geomagnetic field is no trivial matter, since its time evolution is controlled by the complex interaction of fluid flow and magnetic field within Earth’s fluid core (e.g., Roberts and King 2013). The so-called geodynamo is a deterministic system with chaotic dynamics and consequently with a limited horizon of predictability. Estimates of this horizon are in the multidecadal range (Hulot et al. 2010; Lhuillier et al. 2011) that is several times the 5 -year IGRF time scale. In addition, the <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation</b> of the core field, going {{from the surface of the}} core to the surface of the Earth, favors its large scales over the smaller ones, effectively filtering out fast small-scale features that may potentially be detrimental to the quality of the forecast. Finally, the typical time scale for the acceleration of these large scales is on the order of 10 years (see e.g., Christensen et al. 2012), meaning that the geomagnetic evolution at 5 years is generally well approximated by a linear trend. These three points combined (multi-decadal horizon of predictability, small scales filtered out, 10 -year geomagnetic acceleration time scale) explain why a linear extrapolation is rather successful over the lifetime of an IGRF release, even though unexpected sudden changes in the secular variation, in the form of geomagnetic jerks (Mandea et al. 2010), can at times substantially deteriorate the quality of the prediction.|$|E
40|$|Attenuation in wave {{propagation}} in soils is {{the decay of}} the wave amplitude. Total <b>attenuation</b> arises from <b>geometric</b> spreading, apparent <b>attenuation,</b> and material losses (intrinsic attenuation). Intrinsic attenuation is typically quantified {{in terms of the}} damping ratio, D. In laboratory tests, the damping ratio measurement is in general implemented under quasi-static and resonant conditions. Under both conditions, only material losses are reflected in the measured total attenuation. It should be noted that damping ratios measured by different techniques taken under various frequencies may not be comparable if the damping ratio is viscous in nature. For in-situ testing, corrections for geometric spreading and apparent attenuation are required to obtain the material damping ratio. The spectral ratio method is an effective way to make such corrections. Preliminary studies conducted in a K-o-container in the laboratory show that the measured damping ratio by the spectral ratio method (D-min similar to 4 %) is much higher than the measured ratio by the resonant column test (D-min similar to 0. 23 %), although the coupling effects including the transducer response are considered. This discrepancy may be due to interference of the sensor with the propagating wave, multiple reflections from the boundary, near field effects, phase delay and signal distortion from the peripheral electronic devices, and other unknown factors...|$|R

RT specific tests included: uniformity characteristics of radio-frequency (RF) coil, couch top <b>attenuation,</b> <b>geometric</b> distortion, laser and couch movement and an end-to-end radiotherapy treatment planning test. General tests for overall system performance and safety measurements were also performed. Results: The use of pre-scan based intensity correction increased the uniformity from 61. 7 % to 97 % (body flexible coil), from 50 % to 90 % (large flexible coil) and from 51 % to 98 % (small flexible coil). RT flat top couch decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by an average of 42 %. The mean and maximum geometric distortion was found to be 1. 25 mm and 4. 08 mm for three dimensional (3 D) corrected image acquisition, 2. 07 mm and 7. 88 mm for two dimensional (2 D) corrected image acquisition over 500 mm × 375 mm × 252 mm field of view (FOV). The accuracy of the laser and couch movement was less than ± 1 mm. The standard deviation of registration parameters for the end-to-end test was less than 0. 41 mm. An on-going QA program was developed to monitor the system’s performance.

A recently identified diffusing plate boundary just around 300 km {{away from the}} southern tip of Sri Lanka poses significant seismic risk. However, a comprehensive study of the region with respect to the propagation or attenuation of seismic waves has generally been lacking. With the availability of new archival data of 71 events recorded at three digital broadband stations, we have estimated Q value for the northern Indian Ocean region surrounding Sri Lanka. Multiple linear regression analysis of recorded vertical-component Fourier acceleration amplitudes yields a relatively higher Q 0 value of about 389 ± 2. 35 for the subject region. Furthermore, the combined effect of upper crustal amplification and attenuation has been assessed using the standard horizontal-to-vertical ratio method. The negligible upper crustal modifications obtained from the analysis imply the presence of an older crustal rock stratigraphy at near-source depths around the subject region.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by magnetization in Earth's crust and lithosphere {{can be distinguished}} from the field produced by electric currents in Earth's core because the spatial magnetic power spectrum of the crustal field {{differs from that of}} the core field. Theoretical forms for the spectrum of the crustal field are derived by treating each magnetic domain in the crust as the point source of a dipole field. The geologic null-hypothesis that such moments are uncorrelated is used to obtain the magnetic spectrum expected from a randomly magnetized, or unstructured, spherical crust of negligible thickness. This simplest spectral form is modified to allow for uniform crustal thickness, ellipsoidality, and the polarization of domains by an periodically reversing, geocentric axial dipole field from Earth's core. Such spectra are intended to describe the background crustal field. Magnetic anomalies due to correlated magnetization within coherent geologic structures may well be superimposed upon this background; yet representing each such anomaly with a single point dipole may lead to similar spectral forms. Results from attempts to fit these forms to observational spectra, determined via spherical harmonic analysis of MAGSAT data, are summarized in terms of amplitude, source depth, and misfit. Each theoretical spectrum reduces to a source factor multiplied by the usual exponential function of spherical harmonic degree n due to <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation</b> with attitude above the source layer. The source factors always vary with n and are approximately proportional to n(exp 3) for degrees 12 through 120.

Seismic hazard is a complex problem often involving considerable uncertainties.

With the aim of characterizing and quantifying hazard in the east African region of Eritrea and its surroundings, a study is included in the thesis presenting hazard maps constructed using two non-parametric probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) approaches. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) values for 10 % probability of exceedence in 50 years are computed at given grid points for the whole selected area and results from both methods are compared.

40|$|On October 31 st and November 1 st, 2002 two {{moderate}} earthquakes of moment magnitude Mw= 5. 7 (INGV-Harvard European-Mediterranean Regional Centroid-Moment tensor project) {{occurred in}} southern Italy. After the mainshocks, felt in many municipalities of the Molise and Puglia region, a strong motion and a seismic temporary network were {{installed in the}} epicentral area and surrounding regions. The strong motion network was composed by 9 stations, integrating the accelerometers of the permanent Rete Accelerometrica Nazionale (RAN network), and operated until December 2003. The strong motion data set is composed by 195 recordings from 51 earthquakes (2. 5 <Ml< 5. 4) recorded by 29 accelerometers (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile et al., 2004). In addition to the strong motion network, several Italian research institutions (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, INGV; Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica, INOGS; Dipartimento per lo studio del Territorio e delle sue Risorse, University of Genoa, Dip. Te. Ris) installed a temporary regional network, composed by 35 seismic stations. This network aimed at monitoring and studying the evolution {{in time and space}} of the seismic sequence. More than 1900 aftershocks were recorded in the period November 1 st - December 5 th, 2002 (Chiarabba et al., 2005). The unified velocity-acceleration data set has been considered to derive ground motion models for peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity for both maximum horizontal and vertical components. The results obtained for the Molise area have been compared with the attenuation pattern of the Umbria-Marche region (central Italy), that was recently investigated by Bindi et al. (2006). The remarkable differences observed indicate the need of a regional attenuation relation for the area and the need of further investigations, to better identify the role of source characteristics, anelastic and <b>geometric</b> <b>attenuation</b> and site effects in the evaluation of peak ground motion values...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent {{research}} {{interest in the}} consequences of chronic noise for animal populations, the effects of impulsive noise are less well understood. Determining wildlife responses to impulsive sound is pertinent in coastal areas where development of port and power generation industries may result in disturbance from impulsive sounds such as percussive piling, especially around estuaries which may support internationally important numbers of bird species. Discussions between regulators, planning authorities and regional development agencies over precautionary levels of impulsive sound emitting activities are common, yet we're unaware of any study which provides guidance on acceptable noise limits that would keep disturbance to shorebirds to a minimum. This experimental study intentionally disturbed birds at a high tide roost site, an agricultural field adjacent to the sea wall on the south bank of the Humber estuary in northern England, using an impulsive sound, and their behavioural responses were recorded. The researcher sounded an air-horn at ever decreasing distances towards a mixed species flock of shorebirds. While visual disturbance from the experimenter was taken into consideration in the mediods, we cannot statistically separate their effects in this study. An ordinal logistic regression model demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between the decibel (dB(A)) level experienced by {{the birds and the}} behavioural response observed. In principle, this model can be used to predict the probability of a particular behavioural response at a given dB(A) level. Estimates of sound levels which included calculation of <b>geometric</b> and atmospheric <b>attenuation</b> were superior over more simple measures in predicting behavioural responses. This study has implications for assessing possible disturbance caused by impulsive noise, and adds to growing evidence that the effects of noise may be an important, albeit not straightforward, consideration in management decisions made for shorebirds and other avian species. ©Wildfowl & Wedands Trust...|$|R
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) observed by particle detectors {{at the ground}} {{is based on the}} characteristics of observables like the lateral particle density and the arrival times. The lateral densities, inferred for different EAS components from detector data, are usually parameterised by applying various lateral distribution functions (LDFs). The LDFs are used in turn for evaluating quantities like the total number of particles or the density at particular radial distances. Typical expressions for LDFs anticipate azimuthal symmetry of the density around the shower axis. The deviations of the lateral particle density from this assumption arising from various reasons are smoothed out in the case of compact arrays like KASCADE, but not in the case of arrays like Grande, which only sample a smaller part of the azimuthal variation. KASCADE-Grande, an extension of the former KASCADE experiment, is a multi-component Extensive Air Shower (EAS) experiment located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Campus North), Germany. The lateral distributions of charged particles are deduced from the basic information provided by the Grande scintillators - the energy deposits - first in the observation plane, then in the intrinsic shower plane. In all steps azimuthal dependences should be taken into account. As the energy deposit in the scintillators is dependent on the angles of incidence of the particles, azimuthal dependences are already involved in the first step: the conversion from the energy deposits to the charged particle density. This is done by using the Lateral Energy Correction Function (LECF) that evaluates the mean energy deposited by a charged particle taking into account the contribution of other particles (e. g. photons) to the energy deposit. By using a very fast procedure for the evaluation of the energy deposited by various particles we prepared realistic LECFs depending on the angle of incidence of the shower and on the radial and azimuthal coordinates of the location of the detector. Mapping the lateral density from the observation plane onto the intrinsic shower plane does not remove the azimuthal dependences arising from <b>geometric</b> and <b>attenuation</b> effects, in particular for inclined showers. Realistic procedures for applying correction factors are developed. Specific examples of the bias due to neglecting the azimuthal asymmetries in the conversion from the energy deposit in the Grande detectors to the lateral density of charged particles in the intrinsic shower plane are given.

40|$|Estimating organ {{residence}} {{times is}} an essential part of patient-specific dosimetry for radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Quantitative imaging methods for RIT are often evaluated using a single physical or simulated phantom but are intended to be applied clinically where there is variability in patient anatomy, biodistribution, and biokinetics. To provide a more relevant evaluation, the authors have thus developed a population of phantoms with realistic variations in these factors and applied it to the evaluation of quantitative imaging methods both to find the best method and to demonstrate the effects of these variations. Using whole body scans and SPECT∕CT images, organ shapes and time-activity curves of 111 In ibritumomab tiuxetan were measured in dosimetrically important organs in seven patients undergoing a high dose therapy regimen. Based on these measurements, we created a 3 D NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) -based phantom population. SPECT and planar data at realistic count levels were then simulated using previously validated Monte Carlo simulation tools. The projections from the population were used to evaluate the accuracy and variation in accuracy of residence time estimation methods that used a time series of SPECT and planar scans. Quantitative SPECT (QSPECT) reconstruction methods were used that compensated for attenuation, scatter, and the collimator-detector response. Planar images were processed with a conventional (CPlanar) method that used <b>geometric</b> mean <b>attenuation</b> and triple-energy window scatter compensation and a quantitative planar (QPlanar) processing method that used model-based compensation for image degrading effects. Residence times were estimated from activity estimates made at each of five time points. The authors also evaluated hybrid methods that used CPlanar or QPlanar time-activity curves rescaled to the activity estimated from a single QSPECT image. The methods were evaluated in terms of mean relative error and standard deviation of the relative error in the residence time estimates taken over the phantom population. The mean errors in the residence time estimates over all the organs were < 9. 9 % (pure QSPECT), < 13. 2 % (pure QPLanar), < 7. 2 % (hybrid QPlanar∕QSPECT), < 19. 2 % (hybrid CPlanar∕QSPECT), and 7 %– 159 % (pure CPlanar). The standard deviations of the errors for all the organs over all the phantoms were < 9. 9 %, < 11. 9 %, < 10. 8 %, < 22. 0 %, and < 107. 9 % for the same methods, respectively. The processing methods differed both in terms of their average accuracy and the variation of the accuracy over the population of phantoms, thus demonstrating the importance of using a phantom population in evaluating quantitative imaging methods. Hybrid CPlanar∕QSPECT provided improved accuracy compared to pure CPlanar and required the addition of only a single SPECT acquisition. The QPlanar or hybrid QPlanar∕QSPECT methods had mean errors and standard deviations of errors that approached those of pure QSPECT while providing simplified image acquisition protocols, and thus may be more clinically practical...|$|R
