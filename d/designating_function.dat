Under this aspect, an overview is provided over the development and use of Upper Sorbian linguistic terminology past and present. Only recently, a Sorbian-­language passage on the orthography of this tongue {{at the end of the}} 17 th century was discovered. This establishes the oldest linguistic text in Upper Sorbian so far identified. As far as is known, the first two linguistic termini used were introduced by Z. Běrlink in his treaty of the Upper Sorbian orthography (1689), that is samohłósny ‘vowels’ and sobuhłósny ‘consonants’. Until the 19 th century, grammars of Upper Sorbian were written in German and Latin, which means that the use of linguistic termini in this tongue was mostly restricted to their <b>designating</b> <b>function</b> and were in most cases equivalents of the lexical itmes ‘vowel’ and ‘consonant’. This article also deals with varying current questions of the existing linguistic terminology, for example, its stability, its currency and its applicability. In this context, the contribution to the information­question system of the Slavic linguistic internet forum iSybislaw and its developing dictionary of Slavic linguistic keywords is also described...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} perform their <b>designated</b> <b>functions,</b> {{proteins}} require precise subcellular localizations. For cell-surface proteins, such as receptors and channels, {{they are able to}} transduce signals only when properly targeted to the cell membrane. Calreticulin is a multi-functional chaperone protein involved in protein folding, maturation, and trafficking. However, evidence has been accumulating that calreticulin can also negatively regulate the surface expression of certain receptors and channels. In these instances, depletion of calreticulin enhances cell-surface expression and function. In this review, we discuss the role of calreticulin with a focus on its negative effects on the expression of cell-surface proteins...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive maintenance strategy with optimal inspection planning and {{its application to}} rubble mound breakwaters. In order to fulfil <b>designated</b> <b>functions,</b> a breakwater has to be inspected during its lifetime {{and has to be}} repaired if necessary. Actions of inspecting and repairing form a maintenance strategy. In the paper rational maintenance decision-making approaches are discussed. The proposed maintenance strategy combines time-dependent and condition-dependent maintenance with event-dependent inspection. Optimal inspection planning is obtained by cost optimization with a safety constraint. In practical cases, it is possible to achieve an optimal inspection plan when relevant parameters of strength and load are existing and available.

40|$|Most {{continental}} sediments {{are composed}} of overlapped components, whose grain-size follows a type of distribution function. The components and the function type of a sample are determined on frequency and cumulative curves of grain-size distribution so as to <b>designate</b> the <b>function</b> formula. The function parameters can be estimated by fitting <b>designated</b> <b>function</b> to measured grain-sized data of the sample, which simultaneously achieves numerical partitioning of the components. Genetic analysis of hydraulic and aeolian sediments demonstrates the following environmental implications. Fluvial sediment is composed of isolated saltation and suspension component. The sediment in drainage closed lakes is dominated by suspension silt-clay component, with little portion of saltatory sand. Fine sand component makes up a majority of desert sand overlapped with small portion of fine dust. Loess is composed of overlapped short-suspending silt component and long-suspension fine component. Long-suspension fine dust is the unique component of deep-sea aeolian sediment. The fine component shows constant grain-size distribution and genetic connection from desert sand, loess of Northern China to Northern Pacific Ocean, which is transported mainly by westerly stream and dispersed in whole stratosphere to form the background dust...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a thermal-structural test program to verify the {{performance}} of a metallic/radiative Thermal Protection System (TPS) under reentry conditions are presented. This TPS panel is suitable for multiple reentry, high L/D space vehicles, such as the NASA space shuttle, having surface temperatures up to 1200 C (2200 F). The TPS panel tested consists of a corrugation-stiffened, beaded-skin TD Ni- 20 Cr metallic heat shield backed by a flexible fibrous quartz and radiative shield insulative system. Test conditions simulated the critical heating and aerodynamic pressure environments expected during 100 repeated missions of a reentry vehicle.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{high-throughput}} {{structural analysis}} of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins, we have solved {{the structure of the}} non-structural protein 9 (nsp 9). This protein, encoded by ORF 1 a, has no <b>designated</b> <b>function</b> but is most likely involved with viral RNA synthesis. The protein comprises a single beta-barrel with a fold previously unseen in single domain proteins. The fold superficially resembles an OB-fold with a C-terminal extension and is related to both of the two subdomains of the SARS-CoV 3 C-like protease (which belongs to the serine protease superfamily). nsp 9 has, presumably, evolved from a protease. The crystal structure suggests that the protein is dimeric. This is confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering. We show that nsp 9 binds RNA and interacts with nsp 8, activities that may be essential for its function(s) ...|$|R
