5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

The album took a year and one month to record, and features an [...] "eclectic sound" [...] in Sanz's words, containing elements of flamenco, R, and folk music.

2500|$|Ryan Benjamin Tedder {{was born}} on June 26, 1979 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised by an {{extended}} family of missionaries and pastors in a Christian church. He began learning {{to play the piano}} at the age of three via the Suzuki method. His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn. Tedder started singing at the age of seven. A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to other acts like Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, [...] "I sang for two hours a day <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life until I was eighteen." [...] He continued to perform musically during his adolescence through church, school, and personally formed groups.|$|E

The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat.
