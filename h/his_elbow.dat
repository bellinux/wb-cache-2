5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> for the entire season. His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him {{at least half of}} the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week after the season started.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a few inches below <b>his</b> <b>elbow.</b> Mitchell can move the tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold and manipulate objects by gripping them in <b>his</b> <b>elbow.</b> He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 off-season, Hamels {{underwent}} {{elbow and}} hernia surgeries. Hamels had missed scheduled starts in August {{due to a}} stiff shoulder, and loose bodies were removed from <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> to fix his problems. Hamels was ready to pitch {{by the start of}} Spring training 2012.|$|E
50|$|February 28, 2013 Lopez {{had surgery}} on <b>his</b> left <b>elbow</b> {{and then had}} another surgery on March 27 for <b>his</b> right <b>elbow.</b> Lopez took time to rest and recover from the {{surgeries}} on <b>his</b> <b>elbows.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thomas Rooper now {{leaned forward}} with <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> on <b>his</b> knees without smoking, and Asaph Scantle leaned forward with <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> on <b>his</b> knees without smoking. And thus they remained, saying nothing to each other, {{for the space}} of some ten minutes.|$|R
60|$|Paramor put <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> on the desk, {{and lightly}} pressed his finger-tips together.|$|R
5|$|Ellis {{missed the}} last month of the season due to {{tendinitis}} in <b>his</b> <b>elbow.</b> Despite a strong start from Ellis during the playoff chase in the final week of the season, the Pirates lost the division to the New York Mets. Ellis again {{led the league in}} home runs allowed per nine innings pitched ratio (0.328).|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} bout was a tag team {{match between}} {{the team of}} B.G. James and Jeff Hammond and Michael Shane and Kazarian. James and Hammond were the victors in the encounter after Hammond dropped onto Kazarian with <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> cocked to gain the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Asashōryū {{got off to}} a bad {{start in}} the July tournament by losing to Toyonoshima on the first day. After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, he pulled out of the tournament on the sixth day citing pain in <b>his</b> <b>elbow.</b> The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of the 2012 season, Wilson injured <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> and {{subsequently}} underwent his second Tommy John surgery. He completed his recovery midway through the 2013 season and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching effectively with them as a late-inning reliever through the playoffs. However, he was not able to continue his success in 2014, and the Dodgers released him after that season.|$|E

5|$|TNA held a Black Tie Brawl and Chain {{match between}} Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt, which lasted 11 minutes and 14 seconds. In this match, both {{competitors}} were tied together via a chain {{and dressed in}} tuxedos. The only way to win was to strip their opponent of the tuxedo and either make them submit or pin them afterwards. Lethal won the encounter after jumping off of a turnbuckle to drive <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> into Dutt's chest and followed with the pin.|$|E
5|$|After a coach saw Wilson pitch well at {{a tournament}} in California, {{he was offered}} a {{scholarship}} to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played for the LSU Tigers baseball team, eventually becoming their No. 2 starter. In his time at LSU, Wilson pitched in 51 games (22 starts) and accumulated 18 wins, 10 losses, and five saves. He {{was in the middle}} of his third season on March 28, 2003, when he injured <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> and underwent Tommy John surgery. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for collegiate prospects. Despite facing extensive rehabilitation, Wilson chose to enter the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.|$|E
5|$|He {{fell to the}} 413th {{overall pick}} in the 14th round, {{selected}} by the Anaheim Angels. Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting Eddie Bane convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus ($ in 2010) on July 26, 2004. After having Dr. James Andrews perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> at the Angels' rehab facility in Tempe, Arizona. During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at Arizona State University.|$|E

5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E
5|$|On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets {{history in a}} nine-inning game. DeGrom's final pitching appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his ulnar nerve in late September in order to relieve discomfort in <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> and numbness in his fingers which had plagued him during the 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary Stampeders signed Williams as an {{international}} free agent on May 28, 2015. Williams made the Stampeders' active roster following preseason and made his CFL debut on July 18 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He started three games at left tackle before being forced to leave the August 1st game against the Montreal Alouettes with an arm injury. After Williams reportedly had X-rays of <b>his</b> <b>elbow</b> taken, {{he was diagnosed with}} a hyperextended right elbow. He suffered multiple injuries {{during the rest of the}} regular season, causing him to sit out several games. He returned in time to play in both playoff games for Calgary.|$|E

5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali had control {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the crowd, as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor. Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with <b>his</b> <b>elbow.</b> Khali regained the upper hand, scoop slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E
5|$|The team began a {{road trip}} against two {{division}} rivals: the Mets and the Nationals. In {{the first game of}} the Mets series, the Phillies lost 7–1 against Bartolo Colón; although Colón and A. J. Burnett (the Phillies' starter) were trade candidates, neither was traded. The next day Utley hit a grand slam and Hamels continued his dominance as the Phillies shut out the Mets 6–0, but the Mets routed the Phillies 11–2 in the series finale. The last game of the month opened a four-game series with the Nationals; the Phillies won 10–4 but Lee re-injured <b>his</b> <b>elbow,</b> probably ending his season.|$|E
5|$|Weber debuted {{with the}} {{national}} senior team on April 22, 2007, accepting an invitation to join the club for the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Russia. Weber's experience in this tournament, however, was interrupted by an incident {{for which he was}} suspended three games. A minute into Canada's preliminary round game versus Germany, Weber hit Yannic Seidenberg in the chin with <b>his</b> <b>elbow,</b> giving the German a concussion and sidelining him {{for the remainder of the}} tournament. After serving his suspension, Weber continued with the tournament, finishing with two points in six games played, including a goal in Canada's 5–1 quarterfinal victory over Switzerland. Canada went on to win the gold medal in the tournament, defeating Finland 4–2.|$|E
