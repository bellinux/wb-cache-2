5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The <b>Great</b> <b>Room.</b> The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The <b>Great</b> <b>Room,</b> predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The <b>Great</b> <b>Room</b> contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E

On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The apartment {{on the top floor}} had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city.|$|E

50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>rooms</b> were {{initially}} popular with homeowners. According to builders {{asked by the}} Wall Street Journal, this was because homeowners wanted a way to show off wealth in a growing economy. But about 15 years after <b>great</b> <b>rooms</b> became widely popular in the early 1990s, developers across America were getting fewer demands for houses with <b>great</b> <b>rooms,</b> preferring instead houses with increased floor space and numbers of rooms. Owners of existing homes with <b>great</b> <b>rooms</b> were sometimes opting to add new rooms or lofts in the <b>great</b> <b>room's</b> ceiling space, which can {{cost as much as}} 50% less than adding a conventional addition to the house. According to the United States Census Bureau, from 2005 to 2007 expenditures on the interior restructuring of homes rose by about 40% but spending on new-room additions fell by 57%, which a census bureau statistician said can be explained in part by the retrofitting of <b>great</b> <b>rooms.</b> However, much of the motivation for working within the existing footprint of the home may be due to state and municipal regulations which may trigger higher taxes, additional permit hurdles, or septic system redesigns when a building's footprint increases.|$|R

Strasbourg was again a French city when work was finally conducted. Architect Paul Dopff (1885–1965) added a wing in a more severe style, closer to Beaux-Arts architecture, in 1921. That wing was centred around a <b>great</b> <b>room</b> for choir rehearsals called Salle de la Marseillaise.|$|E

When they were first built they were painted and decorated with gold and jewels. Some of them were used as columns to hold up the roof of the <b>great</b> <b>room</b> in the temple of Tlahuizcalpantecutli. This use of Statues as columns is thought to have been common in Toltec architecture. Outside of Chichen Itza the toltecs had little influence on the architecture in Yucatan.|$|E

Its umbrella organization — the Student Theatre Coalition, or StuCo — organizes nine student theater companies, multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent productions each year. Many Northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers.

500|$|In 1793, American Revolution veteran John [...] "Lightning" [...] McQueen (1751–1807) was {{lured to}} Fort George Island from South Carolina by the Spanish government, which rewarded McQueen with the island. McQueen settled with 300 slaves and {{constructed}} a large {{house in a}} unique architectural style exhibiting four corner pavilions surrounding a <b>great</b> <b>room.</b> McQueen was soon bankrupt due to misfortunes, and the possession of the plantation turned over to John McIntosh (1773–1836) from Georgia who revived it in 1804. McIntosh, however, took {{a leading role in}} the Patriot Rebellion, an insurgency by Americans to hasten the annexation of Florida to the United States. The rebellion was unsuccessful, and McIntosh fled back into Georgia to escape punishment from the Spanish.|$|E

As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, rug and chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace.

500|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons Zack was chosen as protagonist was because his fate was predetermined. Kitase stated that Zack's story had [...] "been cooking for 10 years" [...] as, despite being a minor {{character}} in Final Fantasy VII, Nomura had already developed conceptual artwork, and Kazushige Nojima had already worked out a story. The game was originally meant to have more scenes depicting Zack and Cloud's flight to Midgar, so as to expand on their friendship and unrealized plans, but these scenes were removed due to UMD limitations, and so the staff focused more on Zack's background as a formidable warrior. The addition {{of the character of}} Genesis to the story came about after discussions between producer Hideki Imaizumi and the character's Japanese voice actor, Gackt, as Imaizumi had been impressed with the characters' brief appearance in the secret ending to , and felt there was <b>great</b> <b>room</b> to expand the character. Sephiroth's role was specifically written to give him a [...] "much more human side."

The gilt and red velvet furniture complements the collection of paintings by Van Dyck {{of the family of}} Charles I and the family of his contemporary Earl of Pembroke. Between the windows are mirrors by Chippendale and console tables by William Kent. The coffered ceiling, painted by Thomas de Critz, depicts the story of Perseus. Here again is another anomaly which makes one question the true involvement of Jones: [...] the great Venetian window, centrepiece of the south front and centrepiece of the double cube room, is not the dead centre of the room's outer wall; [...] the other windows in the room are not symmetrically placed; [...] and the central fireplace and Venetian window are not opposite each other as the proportions of a room designed as an architectural feature in itself would demand.|$|E

2500|$|History {{painting}} in the grand manner continued {{to be the most}} prestigious form of art, though not the easiest to sell, and Reynolds made several attempts at it, as unsuccessful as Hogarth's. [...] The unheroic nature of modern dress was seen as a major obstacle in the depiction of contemporary scenes, and the Scottish gentleman-artist and art dealer Gavin Hamilton preferred classical scenes as well as painting some based on his Eastern travels, where his European figures by-passed the problem by wearing Arab dress. [...] He spent most of his adult life based in Rome and had at least as much influence on Neo-Classicism in Europe as in Britain. [...] The Irishman James Barry was an influence on Blake but had a difficult career, and spent years on his cycle The Progress of Human Culture in the <b>Great</b> <b>Room</b> of the Royal Society of Arts. [...] The most successful history painters, who were not afraid of buttons and wigs, were both Americans settled in London: Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, though one of his most successful works Watson and the Shark (1778) was able to mostly avoid them, showing a rescue from drowning. [...] Smaller scale subjects from literature were also popular, pioneered by Francis Hayman, {{one of the first to}} paint scenes from Shakespeare, and Joseph Highmore, with a series illustrating the novel Pamela. [...] At the end of the period the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery was an ambitious project for paintings, and prints after them, illustrating [...] "the Bard", as he had now become, and exposing the limitations of contemporary English history painting. Joseph Wright of Derby was mainly a portrait painter who also was one of the first artists to depict the Industrial Revolution, as well as developing a cross between the conversation piece and history {{painting in}} works like An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768) and A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (c. 1766), which like many of his works are lit only by candlelight, giving a strong chiaroscuro effect.|$|E
