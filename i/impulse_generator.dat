40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the hypothesis that lightning impulses can lead to accelerated ageing of extruded polymeric cables. The behaviour of an insulation material when suffering lightning impulses is different from that for DC or power frequency over-voltages. Shaped HDPE material samples have been manufactured using a mould tool. The samples then may be electrically aged using one of the Tony Davies High Voltage Laboratory's <b>impulse</b> <b>generators.</b> A real-time software based monitoring tool has been designed to control the impulse wave-shape and process the measurement data. Sets of identical lightning impulses were applied to samples and this was then followed by ramped AC breakdown tests. The obtained results were analyzed using the Weibull distribution method to identify the difference in lifetime. These results will inform the further development of models describing the multifactor ageing mechanisms that in-service cables experience. ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s {{described}} an operation using the gracilis muscle {{from the inner}} thigh and wrapping it around the anus {{to function as a}} new anal sphincter (neosphincter). Non dynamic graciloplasty was not particularly successful because the gracilis is mostly composed of type II, fast-twitch, fatiguable muscle fibres, whereas the sphincter ideally {{needs to be able to}} automatically contract for long periods. A neurostimulation device with an <b>impulse</b> <b>generator</b> can be implanted to adapt the muscle to prolonged contraction (dynamic graciloplasty). Over time, the muscle becomes mostly composed of type I, slow twitch, fatigue resistant fibres. The patient uses an external magnetic programming device to deactivate the electrical stimulation, relaxing the muscular contraction and enabling defecation at a voluntary time. Dynamic graciloplasty may be indicated for patients with a completely destroyed anal sphincter or a torn sphincter with a large gap between both ends that is not amenable to repair. The procedure involves detachment of the gracilis from the leg, preserving both its blood supply and innervation. The muscle is then moved to wrap around the anal canal completely, and also attached to the periosteum of the inferior ramus of the pubic bone. Various arrangements are described, depending upon the length of the gracilis. The implanted stimulator electrode is placed intramuscularly (within the muscle), very close to the gracilis nerve, and the <b>impulse</b> <b>generator</b> is placed subcutaneously (under the skin). The success rate of the operation is between 40-60%, and varies with surgeon experience. The complication rate is high, (infections 28%, device problems 15%, andleg pain 13%) but these are usually treatable without influence on the final result. A second operation may be required for some complications. When dynamic graciloplasty is successful in curing FI, up to 50% of patients may develop signs and symptoms of obstructed defecation.|$|E
