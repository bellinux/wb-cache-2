We argue that this ill-defined debate on indexing is due to a confusion between efficiency and Gaussian efficiency. The originality of the paper resides in the point of view choosen as the « main thread ». Instead of focusing on informational issues, now better understood since the seminal paper of Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), we concentrate on the probabilistic aspects included in the testable applications of the concept, so as to connect Fama’s statement of 1970 to Bachelier’s work (Theory of Speculation) of 1900. We establish the link between Bachelier’s dissertation and portfolio management applications of market efficiency.
