5|$|After the war, Col. William S. Clark {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in early American/Japanese relations. After establishing the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), Clark was invited {{by the government}} of Japan to establish a similar institution, the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the University of Hokkaido). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Hokkaido and the influence he had {{on the development of the}} island. His military experience during the Civil War was an important factor in earning the respect of his Japanese superiors.|$|E
5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the job {{began to fade}} as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E

25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{was one of}} {{the great}} cricketers and <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> cricket as to all his {{undertakings}} an assurance and capacity for concentration that positively commanded success.

25|$|Van Gogh was {{particularly}} inspired by Jean-François Millet's work {{image of the}} sower and the soulfulness <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the works, honoring peasants' agricultural role. Plowing, sowing, and harvesting were seen by Van Gogh as symbols for man's command of nature and its eternal cycles of life.|$|E
25|$|After {{acquiring}} TBW in 1966, Kaplan {{continued to}} write for the magazine, contributing (primarily) editorials and tournament reports.

25|$|The men {{returned}} from Australia {{a number of}} years later. William wrote several books describing its flora and fauna.

25|$|Unlike {{his earlier}} days, {{when he played}} works in {{progress}} at gatherings of The Five, Balakirev composed in isolation. He was aware that younger composers now considered his compositional style old-fashioned. Except initially for Glazunov, whom <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Rimsky-Korsakov as a prodigy, and his later acolyte Sergei Lyapunov, Balakirev was ignored by the younger generation of Russian composers.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Philipp Jacob Wolf (13 March 1860 – 22 February 1903) was an Austrian {{composer}} of Slovene origin, particularly {{noted for}} his art songs, or Lieder. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> this form a concentrated expressive intensity which was unique in late Romantic music, somewhat {{related to that}} of the Second Viennese School in concision but diverging greatly in technique.|$|E
25|$|Al-Zahawi {{undertook}} {{his last}} exhibition in 1998 {{at the age}} of 63 at Galerie de la Tour in Altkirch, France. With this one-man show, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> a close an illustrious career that spanned five decades.

25|$|He {{served as}} Chairman of The Business Council in 1989 and 1990. His tenure at GM ended in 1990, {{one year after}} the release of the popular {{underground}} documentary Roger & Me, where many displaced GM workers called for Smith's retirement. Smith voluntarily retired from GM, and later toured the new Saturn facility in Tennessee, which <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> fruition, in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Palmerston {{placed his}} trust... in the Press {{which he was}} at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper {{he knew how to}} catch and the weight of his name and {{resources}} <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.|$|E
25|$|Using {{contacts}} he {{had made}} while living in the city, Weston gave the first solo exhibition of {{his work at the}} Montross Gallery in New York City. Seventy sketches and 63 paintings were shown in November 1922. The show was a huge success. Restricted to landscapes, critics nevertheless heaped praise on his vibrant use of color and the unique American perspective <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> his work.|$|E

25|$|But what he {{most wanted}} was to write a {{biography}} of Napoleon. Now Sir Walter Scott was writing his own life of Napoleon, from a strictly conservative point of view, and Hazlitt wanted to produce one from a countervailing, liberal perspective. Really, his stance on Napoleon was his own, as he had idolised Napoleon for decades, and he prepared to return to Paris to undertake the research. First, however, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> fruition another favourite idea.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{innovations}} <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> {{the oil industry}} {{and the construction of}} numerous bridges and buildings, Shukhov was the inventor of a new family of doubly curved structural forms. These forms, based on non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, are known today as hyperboloids of revolution. Shukhov developed not only many varieties of light-weight hyperboloid towers and roof systems, but also the mathematics for their analysis. Shukhov is particularly reputed for his original designs of hyperboloid towers such as the Shukhov Tower.|$|E

He expected to use this launch for demonstrating his system in forming Liquid Fuel Engineering Company in America, but on account of the death of his English associate, Sir Robert Simons, he gave up the launch business.|$|E
