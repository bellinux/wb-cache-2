40|$|<b>Nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are standardly {{interpreted}} as information processing input-output devices. They receive environmental information from their sensors as input, subsequently process or adjust this information, {{and use the}} result to control effectors, providing output. Through-conducting activity is here the key organizational feature of <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we argue that this input-output interpretation {{is not the most}} fundamental feature of <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> organization. Building on biological work on the early evolution of <b>nervous</b> <b>systems,</b> we provide an alternative proposal: the skin brain thesis (SBT). The SBT postulates that early <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> evolved to organize a new multicellular effector: muscle tissue, the primary source of animal motility. Early <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> provided a new way of inducing and coordinating self-organized contractile activity across an extensive muscle surface underneath the skin. The main connectivity in such <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> runs across a spread out effector and is transverse to sensor-effector signaling. The SBT therefore constitutes a fundamental conceptual shift in understanding both <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> operation and what <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are. <b>Nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are foremost spatial organizers that turn large multi-cellular animal bodies into dynamic self-moving units. At the end, we briefly discuss some theoretical connections to central issues within the behavioral, cognitive and neurosciences. ...|$|R
