While <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> 1 was constructed with freight loops, no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003.

40|$|Abstract: Provided with in-field crash-investigation and {{reported}} information from 4476 real accident episodes, a log-linear model {{is used to}} capture the relationship between speed and its predictors such as speed limit. While by introducing a binary logit model, the estimated speed may contribute explanatory power on subject driver’s injury severity. From {{the results of the}} first model, we can surmise that <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> goes with <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> limit and speeding violation happens frequently at lower or <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> limit like an U shape. Most interestingly, the second model estimation shows that speed limit can influence collision severity via estimated <b>speed,</b> e. g., <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> limit is associated with <b>higher</b> estimated <b>speed,</b> which in turn is related to more serious injury until the speed limit of expressway or freeway due to higher standard of engineering design.

30|$|The second {{difference}} between vehicles and pedestrians—changed shape when moving—at first sight is a similarity: for <b>higher</b> <b>speeds,</b> larger headways are required.
