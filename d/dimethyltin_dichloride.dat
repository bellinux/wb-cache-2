40|$|The {{photodegradation}} of methyltins, {{as environmental}} pollutants, has scarcely been studied so far {{because of the}} shortage of rapid and sensitive speciation methods, {{even though they have}} very simple structures. The photodegradation of monomethyltin trichloride (MMT), <b>dimethyltin</b> <b>dichloride</b> (DMT) and trimethyltin chloride (TMT) was studied with our new developed HPLC-FPD hyphenated system, which enables rapid and sensitive detection of methyltins. The half-life times and kinetic rate constants of their degradation at different pH were calculated. The results suggest that MMT, DMT and TMT can be degraded under the UV irradiation rapidly at different pH, with a degradation rate sequence of TMT < DMT < MMT. Ail unknown intermediary product, which is more stable and has higher concentration at pH 8 for MMT and DMT, of methyltin photodegradation was detected for the first time. This unknown intermediary product was identified as methyloltin with electrospray mass spectrometry, and the possible mechanism was proposed based on the intermediary product. The effects of some environmental parameters such as salinity and humic acid on the degradation rate of methyltins were also investigated. Results suggest that salinity and humic acid have strong effect on their degradation, especially for TMT, which was almost never degraded in the solutions containing NaCl and humic acid.

The solid state X-ray determination of the complex {[Me 2 ClSn(μ-trione) SnMe 2 Cl 2]·Htrione} (1) revealed that complex 1 contains the simultaneous presence of penta- and hexacoordinated tin(IV) atoms. Notably, trione acts as a bridging ligand through both oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms. While the hexacoordinated tin(IV) atom adopts an octahedral geometry with a trans-[SnMe 2] configuration, the pentacoordinated tin(IV) atom exists in a highly distorted trigonal bipyramidal arrangement with equatorial methyl groups. It is also important to note that there is a free Htrione molecule as a co-crystal in the di-enol form. The complexes [SnMe 2 Cl(tpyCl) ]+[SnMe 2 Cl 3]− (2), [SnMe 2 Cl(tpyOH) ]+Cl− (3) and [SnMe 2 Cl(tpySH) ]+ 2 (SnMe 2 Cl 3) −Cl− (4) were also prepared from the {{reaction of}} SnMe 2 Cl 2 with 4 ′-functionalized 2, 2 ′: 6 ′, 2 ″-terpyridines (tpyX), where X=Cl, O, S.

Methyltin compounds were separated by HPLC, and then on- line reacted with potassium borohydride to generate volatile hydride products. The volatile derivatization products were in- line separated from the liquid matrix with MGLS and further introduced into the cheap and specific QSIL- FPD for detection. With a mobile phase of 70 % methanol, 3 % acetic acid and 27 % water, which contains 0. 1 % tropolone as complexant, at a 0. 3 mL min(- 1) flow rate, monomethyltin (MMT), dimethyltin (DMT) and trimethyltin (TMT) were baseline separated in less than 13 minutes by reversed phase HPLC.

This reaction has considerable environmental importance. The introduction of organotin compounds into the environment may occur {{as a result of their}} use in various commercial products, including agricultural biocides. In this case the organotin species is applied directly into the environment. Once they have entered the environment their persistence and fate is of great importance. Some potential reactions, include UV degradation and environmental methylation, these are discussed in Chapter 1, which also includes a discussion of the various analytical techniques that are used for the determination of organotin compounds. Metal speciation has become very important due to its impact on environmental chemistry. Much research has been centered on developing highly efficient analytical techniques that are able to determine rapidly and sensitively the chemical forms of metals in a variety of sample matrices. Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE), one such technique, has been developed as a powerful technique for the rapid and highly efficient separation of metal species. Chapter 2 contains discussion on the theory of CZE along with a section describing the development of a CZE method, and its validation, for the separation of the methyltin chlorides. Chapter 3 contains a preliminary investigation of the reactions of tetramethyltin, which may occur naturally in the environment.
