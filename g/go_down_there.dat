500|$|... 00:24:30	Graham Hawkes is {{now going}} to return to the phantom five, and using a new submersible, he is going to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> himself and find out, once and for all, who they are.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor takes Martha in the TARDIS to {{the year}} five billion and fifty three {{and the city of}} [...] New New York on the planet New Earth. [...] They end up in an {{alleyway}} where street traders are selling mood patches to help people deal with their emotions. [...] While the Doctor talks to a vendor, Martha is kidnapped at gun point by a young couple named Milo and Cheen. Once in their vehicle, they explain that Cheen is pregnant and that they needed three adult passengers with them to use the fast lane. They promise they will drop Martha off when they reach their destination ten miles away, estimated to take six years. Cheen also mentions rumours about something living down in the fast lane, saying that cars that <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> vanish and are never seen again.|$|E
500|$|A {{story in}} the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the Nugget, stated without {{attribution}} that [...] "The Sheriff stepped out and said : 'Hold up boys, don't <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.'" [...] In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan [...] "was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it." [...] Given the Nugget close relationship to Behan (it was owned by Behan's deputy sheriff), it is likely they interviewed him. By Williams' account, Behan told Virgil Earp immediately after the gunfight a story that corroborated the Nugget report, which the newspaper altered afterward to a version that matched the story Behan later told at the coroner's inquest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> {{the coast}} to Trinkitat," [...] {{he said to the}} captain. [...] "The {{transports}} have <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> that is to be the base of operations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Big Tim has <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> He has net {{the wings}} of the hawk, but he has the spirit of the squirrel, or the legs of the goat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Idiot!" [...] I howled. [...] "Sir Walter's <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Wimpole {{has slipped}} us. He's {{half a mile}} down the other road. You're wrong... Are you deaf? You're wrong!" ...|$|R
500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eye witness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul McCartney also {{remembered the}} event for an interview: [...] " [...] said, 'We should <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> We should go down now {{and just do}} it.' It {{was one of those}} moments where we said, 'Let's not and say we did.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E

60|$|A {{few hours}} more, and the surges <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> was a {{moderate}} sea, a steady breeze, and a clear, starry sky. Such was {{the storm that}} came after our calm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sure," [...] {{interrupted}} Mrs Mangivik, [...] "that little Doocheek has <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> There's {{not another}} {{little boy in}} the tribe but himself would dare to do it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob {{wanted to know how}} things were doing, so he asked Joseph to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what {{you expect me to}} do. You want me to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You are wrong, then,' {{said the}} girl. 'I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> {{the last time}} we were in London. I went one {{afternoon}} when you left me alone. And I did look in.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> {{to do my}} duty as a chaplain, and that's what saved me, {{distinguished}} service cross doesn’t add one bit to my stature. Whatever happened was none of my doing whatsoever." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well--don't you see?--if you <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> as {{a friend}} of mine and were caught {{stealing}} the scarab, there would be just the trouble father wants to avoid--about my engagement, you see, and so on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be helped," [...] said Frank, {{compressing}} his lips; [...] "he {{must not}} <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> The tackle is new; I {{think it will}} hold him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Bertie said, {{returning}} to his former idea, [...] "if Dias can <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> I still think that somehow we might get up a scare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{it will be}} no use waiting here to {{be eaten}} up, Sahib. Do you think Conjeveram would be safe? Because {{it is easy to}} <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> by boat." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Tenchester is a {{wonderful}} place," [...] Nora intervened. [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> lately to study certain phases of women's labour.

6000|$|... "Thanks!" [...] said Austin. [...] "I suppose in {{one respect}} that's a compliment. Still, I almost think, or, at least, I did when I first <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> that if I'd known what {{was in front of}} me I'd have stayed in Grand Canary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] he said, ironically, [...] "that if I <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> I'll find he's corraled a nigger," [...] and {{he looked}} sorrowfully at the three {{specimens}} before him.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} state reformation in 1988, many big {{projects}} were decided regionally, so the number of wafelijzer projects <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> are still some things that fall {{under the supervision of}} the federal government, where wafelijzerpolitiek still happens. One example is the Belgian railway network.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} worse, Peter, it's nearly dark already; it will strike eight bells {{in a minute}} or two, and then we shall have to <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There's</b> no danger, of course, of the ship turning over, but it won't be {{pleasant}} down below. Look out, Peter!" ...|$|R
