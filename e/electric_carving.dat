5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E

500|$|Midway {{through the}} interview, Lyons was allowed a break, {{during which he}} was seen by a doctor, and was given medication. He also met his father during this break. He told his father that he had {{committed}} the murder, to which his father replied: [...] "Dean, you are a terrible liar". The gardaí had an informal meeting during the break, during which some gardaí expressed unease about Dean Lyons; Detective Garda Cox described him as a [...] "Walter Mitty" [...] character during this meeting. There are some significant changes in Lyons' story after the break. For example: prior to the break, he claimed that he had used only one knife and after the break, {{he said that he}} had used four separate weapons, including <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knives. The latter description matches closely to Professor Harbison's report. A number of detailed descriptions were given which matched closely with the physical evidence and with the psychological profile.|$|E

50|$|Ed Alleyne-Johnson is a British {{electric}} violinist and prolific busker. He {{has been}} busking {{since he was}} a Fine Art student at Oxford University in the early 1980s. He uses an <b>electric</b> violin he <b>carved</b> with a kitchen knife, a custom pedalboard and an amplifier he modified to run from rechargeable batteries. This setup has enabled him to perform on the street in almost every major city in Europe, and across the United States and Canada.|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} knife or <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knife is an electrical kitchen device used for slicing foods. An {{electric knife}} requires less physical effort than an ordinary knife and produces neater slices. The device {{consists of two}} serrated blades that are clipped together. When the appliance is switched on, the blades continuously move lengthways to provide the sawing action. In the UK, electric knives were popular in the 1970s and not as popular in today's kitchens.|$|E
50|$|Uday's {{increasingly}} violent, sadistic tendencies {{are displayed}} when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort {{him to a}} party. At the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne, Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and Samira Shahbandar, which devastated his mother, Sajida Talfah, and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in Kamel Hana. When Gegeo passes sarcastic comments about Uday's sexual advances towards his young victim, Uday butchers him with an <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knife {{in front of all}} of the guests. The next morning, Uday's bodyguards are seen dumping the partially naked, beaten body of the young girl.|$|E
50|$|Although {{his status}} as Saddam's elder son made him Saddam's {{prospective}} successor, Uday fell out of favour with his father. In October 1988, {{at a party in}} honour of Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Uday murdered his father's personal valet and food taster, Kamel Hana Gegeo, possibly at the request of his mother. According to Jalopnik website, Uday's vast car collections were burned by his father, Saddam, after the Kamel Hana Gegeo incident. Before an assemblage of horrified guests, an intoxicated Uday bludgeoned Gegeo and repeatedly stabbed him with an <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knife. Gegeo had recently introduced Saddam to a younger woman, Samira Shahbandar, who later became Saddam's second wife. Uday considered his father's relationship with Shahbandar an insult to his mother. He also may have feared losing succession to Gegeo, whose loyalty and fidelity to Saddam Hussein was unquestioned..|$|E

50|$|Throughout much of {{the album}} (recorded in just one day for a Christmas release), both Cook and {{especially}} Moore are drunk and out of control, with Moore in particular regularly collapsing in hysterics (Cook achieving his primary comic aim of making Moore laugh with regular ease). Shortly after the album's release, controversy unsurprisingly erupted {{in a variety of}} forms, most notably a petrol station attendant being fired from his job after it was discovered that he owned a copy of the album (Cook testified at the man's industrial tribunal), and a distributor of talking books accidentally sending out copies of Come Again on cassette in cases intended for the children's classic Black Beauty. The CD reissue adds several previously unreleased routines, including a sketch about Derek (Moore) cutting his wife's hymen out with an <b>electric</b> <b>carving</b> knife, and one of their most popular sketches amongst their fans, 'Mother', in which Moore plays Cooks hysterical, domineering, deranged mother. Like {{much of the}} extra material, it was actually recorded during the 'Ad Nauseam' sessions {{a couple of years later}} than the original Come Again album.|$|E
