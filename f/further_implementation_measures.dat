40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the sleeping position {{and the use of}} duvets in infants in 1994 had changed in comparison with earlier years. Design: Questionnaire survey. Setting: Nationwide investigation in infant welfare centres. Method: 194 infant welfare centres participated in the investigation. In November a questionnaire was completed regarding 25 preferably consecutive infants younger than 10 months, featuring: age in completed months, sex, parity of the mother, birth weight and subsequently: the position in which the infant was laid to sleep, and its cover during the last night. Results: The prone sleeping position decreased roughly from more than 55 % in 1985 - 1987 to 24 % in 1988 and 9 % in 1994. In these surveys prone sleeping was significantly associated with masculine gender, low birthweight and higher parity of the mother. These associations explain at least partly the increased risk of cot death in each of these three conditions. In the Netherlands in November 1994 duvets were still widely used Conclusion: A further reduction of the cot death incidence (in 1993 0, 30 per 1000 live births) may be expected from <b>further</b> <b>implementation</b> of preventive <b>measures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The northwestern Mediterranean region faces two {{contrasting}} realities: intensive {{fishing activity}} and a rising awareness among {{citizens of the}} need to protect ecologically important areas. In NE Spain, {{a large portion of the}} Cap de Creus area will be declared a Natura 2000 offshore site, establishing a large Marine Protected Area. This study examines the spatial distribution of artisanal fisheries and their potential impact on key vulnerable ecosystem components (KVECs) in the region. Data collection is based on a questionnaire-based survey in the absence of better records. An integrative map showing potential cumulative impact values for the Cap de Creus region was developed, including fishing gear pressure on selected KVECs. The most potentially impacted areas were found along the coast and on canyon margins. Results showed that different types of fishing gears converge, implying a higher impact on certain benthic communities and KVECs, with the greatest spatial coverage in coralligenous areas, Posidonia beds and maërl beds. When fishing log book and vessel monitoring system data are not available, the use of fishermen surveys linked to geographical information system tools can provide fundamental information for <b>further</b> <b>implementation</b> of effective <b>measures</b> for ecosystem-based management aimed at improving conservation of marine benthic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} how terrorism countermeasures have been justified and reasoned for in the public arena, specifically in Norwegian media discourses from 1993 to 2007. Changes in the media discourse on the terrorism threat and terrorism countermeasures have been investigated by analyzing the changes in the media representation of the terrorism threat and the arguments behind the <b>implementation</b> of counterterrorism <b>measures.</b> The analysis shows that the media’s framing of terrorism has gone from presenting terrorism mainly as a threat against specific people or delimited events related to international conflicts in the 1990 s to a threat against civilians and whole sectors of society after 9 / 11. Terrorism is presented through the media after 9 / 11 as an omnipresent, societal threat that citizens should be protected from no matter how low the probability of this terrorism might be. In parallel, counterterrorism measures have gone from being described as threats against civil liberties in the 1990 s to a necessity after 9 / 11. The media articles have given a picture of terrorism countermeasures as a topic not defined on the basis of traditional normative risk criteria. As presented in the media, these measures seem beyond rational evaluation and assessment. They have primarily been described as necessary and independent of the risk; factors such as precaution, compliance, solidarity, and moral obligations have been the dominant underpinning arguments behind their implementation. This approach to counterterrorism might (if unquestioned) pave the way for <b>further</b> <b>implementation</b> of such <b>measures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to offer an {{overview}} of the most recent scholarly advances concerning electronic monitoring as a measure and/or sanction, as it has appeared in criminal justice practice since the 1980 s. Furthermore, the article offers guidelines for the development and <b>further</b> <b>implementation</b> of this <b>measure</b> in the Republic of Croatia. Electronic monitoring has been implemented in numerous countries worldwide. The general acceptance of electronic monitoring is the result of striving to reduce the prison population and reduce the high costs associated with it. Based on the extant literature, we notice a lack of interest in the matters related to electronic monitoring in the Republic of Croatia. Both the scholars 2 ̆ 7 and the professionals 2 ̆ 7 interest is directed towards the functioning of the probation service, while the topic of electronic monitoring is mentioned rarely, and predominantly in the context of problematizing the entire probation system. We thus note a lack of scientific and applied written work on this very important topic, particularly in the Croatian context, where this particular alternative sanction is about to be introduced. Planning and implementation of electronic monitoring in the Republic of Croatia form part of the reform of Croatian criminal justice system and it is thus of great importance, based on the knowledge and experience of international practice, to gain insight into the conditions necessary for the planning and introduction of electronic monitoring in the Croatian criminal justice syste...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{and quick}} {{assessment}} of energy conservation measures in greenhouse cultivation supports growers in their operations. Such an overview should quantify {{the consequences of}} changes in energy flows for total energy consumption, amount and quality of production, and farm economy. Using tomato as an example crop, comprehensive energy balances were developed for a reference situation in The Netherlands. Solar radiation, primary and secondary heating circuits and CO 2 from the flue gasses of the heating system were quantified as energy sources. Energy use for air and leaf temperature increase, crop photosynthesis, crop transpiration, as well as energy losses through the roof, walls and ground surface were quantified. Subsequently, the effects of 11 energy conservation measures were computed. Consequences for gas consumption and production were simulated with a greenhouse and a crop growth model, respectively, consequences for quality were assessed {{on the basis of}} expert knowledge, and economic consequences were simulated with a cost-benefit model. For tomato, most energy was saved by increased insulation of the greenhouse cover (23 % saving) and lowered temperature set point (16 %), followed by increased set point for air relative humidity, screen gap control in steps, and temperature integration (all about 5 %). Fresh tomato production fell in most cases, except in case of increased light transmission by the greenhouse cover. Energy use efficiency was defined as the amount of energy required to produce a certain quantity of fresh harvestable product. Energy-conservation aims to decrease the energy use efficiency. Greatest gains were reached through insulation (- 20 %), lowered temperature set point (- 12 %) and improved light transmission (- 8 %). Improved light transmission resulted in the strongest increase of the balance of yield and costs (¿ 2. 6, or 10 %), followed by increase of RH set point, crop-based RH control, crop-based use of the energy screen, increased size of the thermal storage tank and reduction of crop transpiration (all less than ¿ 0. 5). Although energy conservation reduces fuel costs, its implementation depends on the effects on production an overall economic profitability of the farm. Improved roof insulation, reduced temperature set point, screen gap control in steps, increase of the RH set point, temperature integration, and crop-based RH control are first candidates for (<b>further)</b> <b>implementation.</b> Other <b>measures</b> require prior technological advancements or fine-tunin...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between and among parents, teachers, and administrators of elementary, junior and senior high school students regarding their perceptions of the difference between the present and desired applications of computer technology. The areas of computer technology were computer assisted instruction, computer managed instruction, and computer literacy. ^ The needs assessment survey, Applications of Computer Technology, was developed for the study. Respondents indicated to what extent they felt the school currently applied a particular area of computer technology and to what extent it should be applied. Responses were analyzed for each computer technology area by level (elementary, junior and senior high school) and sub-group (parents, teachers, and administrators). ^ The sample population was selected, through a random sampling technique, from parents, teachers, and administrators associated with the Lincoln Public Schools, Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ The following conclusions were drawn based on the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators surveyed: (1) Parents, teachers, and administrators perceived a need for greater implementation in all areas of computer technology. (2) Parents perceived a greater need for <b>further</b> <b>implementation</b> of computer assisted instruction and computer literacy than did teachers and administrators.

Across four months of one school year, a maximum of 4 observations were conducted in each of the 34 classrooms involved in the study. Results indicated that both implementation tools are reliable and valid, and that particular subscales of these measures allowed for discrimination of the three types of classrooms from each other.
