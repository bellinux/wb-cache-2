40|$|The current {{difficulty}} in visualizing the true extent of malignant brain tumors during surgical resection {{represents one of}} the major reasons for the poor prognosis of brain tumor patients. Here, we evaluated the ability of a <b>hand-held</b> Raman <b>scanner,</b> guided by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles, to identify the microscopic tumor extent in a genetically engineered RCAS/tv-a glioblastoma mouse model. In a simulated intraoperative scenario, we tested both a static Raman imaging device and a mobile, <b>hand-held</b> Raman <b>scanner.</b> We show that SERS image-guided resection is more accurate than resection using white light visualization alone. Both methods complemented each other, and correlation with histology showed that SERS nanoparticles accurately outlined the extent of the tumors. Importantly, the hand-held Raman probe not only allowed near real-time scanning, but also detected additional microscopic foci of cancer in the resection bed that were not seen on static SERS images and would otherwise have been missed. This technology has a strong potential for clinical translation because it uses inert gold-silica SERS nanoparticles and a <b>hand-held</b> Raman <b>scanner</b> that can guide brain tumor resection in the operating room...|$|R

The hardware design {{is based on}} a <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanner</b> that includes two Kinect sensors, a mini-PC and LED-based illumination bars. The scanning and reconstruction software has been implemented using open-source software toolkits. The information from the two Kinect sensors is merged into a single 3 D model. Reconstruction is performed by adapting an existing RGB-D SLAM-based algorithm by filtering out nonconsistent correspondences and an alternative graph-based optimization, which results in reconstruction errors of the order of 1 cm. The final result obtained is a complete system with a <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanner</b> and management software which is highly competitive with respect to present commercial systems, using much cheaper technology and open-source toolkits with low reconstruction errors.

40|$|Abstract. Reconstruction of <b>hand-held</b> laser <b>scanner</b> data {{is used in}} {{industry}} primarily for reverse engineering. Traditionally, scanning and reconstruction are separate steps. The operator of the laser scanner has no feedback from the reconstruction results. On-line reconstruction of the CAD geometry allows for such an immediate feedback. We propose a method for on-line segmentation and reconstruction of CAD geometry from a stream of point data based on means that are updated on-line. These means are combined to define complex local ge-ometric properties, e. g., to radii and center points of spherical regions. Using means of local scores, planar, cylindrical, and spherical segments are detected and extended robustly with region growing. For the on-line computation of the means we use so-called accumulated means. They allow for on-line insertion and removal of values and merging of means. Our results show that this approach can be performed on-line and is robust to noise. We demonstrate that our method reconstructs spherical, cylindrical, and planar segments on real scan data containing typical errors caused by <b>hand-held</b> laser <b>scanners.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Three {{dimensional}} {{reconstruction of}} cultural heritage objects {{is an expensive}} and time-consuming process. Recent consumer real-time depth ac-quisition devices, like Microsoft Kinect, allow very fast and simple acquisition of 3 D views. However 3 D scanning with such devices is a challenging task due to the limited accuracy and reliability of the acquired data. This paper introduces a 3 D reconstruction pipeline suited to use consumer depth cameras as <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanners</b> for cultural heritage objects. Several new contributions {{have been made to}} achieve this result. They include an ad-hoc filtering scheme that exploits the model of the error on the acquired data and a novel algorithm for the extraction of salient points exploiting both depth and color data. Then the salient points are used within {{a modified version of the}} ICP algorithm that exploits both geometry and color distances to precisely align the views even when geometry information is not sufficient to constrain the registration. The proposed method, although applicable to generic scenes, has been tuned to the acquisition of sculptures and in this connection its performance is rather interesting as the experimental results indicate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tools we {{employ to}} reveal hidden {{features}} {{of the physical world}} provide feedback with a focus. When we tune a radio, aim a flashlight, position a magnifying glass or follow a Geiger counter, we experience sensory feedback along a smooth focal gradient, a gradient that guides us into alignment with the phenomenon we seek to examine. Focal feedback contributes to seamlessness as we transition between spaces of direct and mediated perception. In transitions between the physical world and digitally mediated spaces, seamlessness represents a fundamental challenge. &quot;Feedback for Finding&quot; explores how one particular form of physical/digital transition — item identification through use of a <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanner</b> — is changed by the introduction of continuous focal feedback. Anticipated outcomes of this research include support for locating physical objects digitally, an improved understanding of manual scene analysis and a platform for further exploration...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{real-time}} depth acquisition devices, like Time-Of-Flight (ToF) cameras or Microsoft Kinect, allow a {{very fast}} and simple acquisition of 3 D views. These sensors {{have been used in}} many applications but their employment for 3 D scanning purposes is a very challenging task due to the limited accuracy and reliability of their data. In this pa-per we present a 3 D acquisition pipeline explicitly targeted to ToF cameras. The proposed scheme aims at obtaining a reliable reconstruction that is not affected by the limiting issues of these cameras and {{is at the same time}} simple and fast in order to allow to use the ToF sensor as an <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanner.</b> In order to achieve these targets an ad-hoc pre-processing stage is used together with a modified ver-sion of the ICP algorithm that is able to recognize the most reliable and relevant points and to use only them for reg-istration purposes. Furthermore, ToF cameras have also been combined with standard color cameras in order to ac-quire colored 3 D models. Experimental results show how the proposed approach is able to produce reliable 3 D re-constructions from the ToF data. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Virtual study models {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on the orthodontic market in 1999. The early systems offered two-dimensional images; reliable 3 D images of study models were obtained only {{with the introduction of}} laser technology. Virtual study models have reduced the number of limitations and obstacles {{associated with the use of}} conventional plaster models and resulted in the creation of the "paperless orthodontic office". To understand their drawbacks, advantages and affordability, the different systems available for virtual dental casts were compared. DISCUSSION: The systems envisaging the use of 3 D virtual study models are: Orthocad, e-models, Orthoproof, SureSmile, Invisalign and Libra. All of these systems offer model "manipulation" options, whereas only Orthocad, e-models and SureSmile offer advanced levels of software complexity, so as to ensure: virtual set-up, computer-aided bracket placement, planning and construction of orthodontic appliances. The use of <b>hand-held</b> <b>scanners</b> calls for highly specific skills. Basic requirements to use digital models include: a personal computer, internet access, management software. CONCLUSION: The digital elaboration of orthodontic study models is developing beyond the collection of morphologic and diagnostic data, towards the planning and production of orthodontic devices, through the use of morphing simulating the several phases of the treatment. Digital 3 D models can be used at a basic and at a more advanced level, depending on the clinician's level of experience. PMID: 20545088 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} decoding a bar code from a signal mea-sured with a <b>hand-held</b> laser-based <b>scanner.</b> Rather than formulating the inverse problem as one of binary image reconstruction, we instead incor-porate the symbology of the bar code into the reconstruction algorithm directly, and search for a sparse representation of the UPC bar code {{with respect to this}} known dictionary. Our approach significantly reduces the degrees of freedom in the problem, allowing for accurate reconstruction that is robust to noise and unknown parameters in the scanning device. We propose a greedy reconstruction algorithm and provide robust recon-struction guarantees. Numerical examples illustrate the insensitivity of our symbology-based reconstruction to both imprecise model parameters and noise on the scanned measurements. ...|$|R
