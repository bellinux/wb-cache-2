5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{suffers a}} back injury from the rodeo and sees a chiropractor, but does not follow his instructions. Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which proves {{to be a successful}} method of solving problems with pain, causing the chiropractic business decline until the chiropractors in town denounce the method and destroy the <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> at the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge, on the {{way back}} from an {{orchestra}} performance, pass through a seedy part of town. Marge cautions Homer, but gets enticed by Snake's Three-card Monte game. Snake cheats Homer out of $20, but Marge exposes the con and Snake takes off. After giving chase, Marge knocks Snake unconscious with a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> lid, giving her a sense of exhilaration. Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance {{measures}} include proper {{storage of}} garbage, removal of water sources, and elimination of environments suitable for nesting. <b>Garbage</b> <b>cans</b> {{need to be}} rat-resistant and made out of metal rather than plastic. Because rats easily chew through plastic, the Health Department recommends placing plastic garbage bags inside rat-resistant metal <b>garbage</b> <b>cans.</b> <b>Garbage</b> should be placed {{out on the street}} close to the pickup time, rather than the night before.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b> The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b> The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E

5|$|Kristina (Monica Potter) is {{teaching}} Haddie (Sarah Ramos) how to drive, but is so over-worried she stresses her daughter out. Haddies tries to convince Adam {{to teach her}} instead, but he refuses. Later, during another lesson, Kristina distresses Haddie so much she crashes into a <b>garbage</b> <b>can,</b> damaging a side mirror. The two later argue, but they eventually reconcile, and Kristina explains she dreads the idea of her daughter dying in an accident. Meanwhile, Crosby (Dax Shepard) meets and seems attracted to Gaby (Minka Kelly), the therapist helping Max (Max Burkholder). Crosby is {{trying to cope with}} missing his son Jabbar (Tyree Brown) and girlfriend Jasmine (Joy Bryant), who is in New York City pursuing her dancing career. Jabbar plans to visit Crosby, who promises Max the two boys can have a sleepover, much to Max's excitement. However, Jasmine later tells Crosby she cannot visit after all due to an audition. When Crosby tells Max, he grows hysterical due to his Asperger syndrome. He is calmed by Gaby while Crosby watches, realizing the extent of Max's problems. Haddie later has a sleepover with a now-happy Max.|$|E

25|$|The seventh {{match was}} the street fight between Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Shane {{dominated}} his father during the earlier {{part of the}} match by attacking him with various weapons such as a kendo stick and monitors from the Spanish broadcast table. Shane laid Vince on said table, and performed a diving elbow drop off the top rope but his sister, Stephanie, pulled Vince out of the way, causing Shane to crash through it. Trish Stratus came towards the ring, pushing Linda McMahon out in a wheelchair, and then slapped Vince, causing her and Stephanie {{to get into a}} fight that led them out of the stadium. As referee Foley tried to wheel Linda out to safety, Vince hit him with a steel chair, and then pulled Linda into the ring to make her watch as he beat down Shane with a <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b> However, Linda stood up and low blowed Vince, allowing Foley to recover and attack him. With Vince prone in the corner, Shane placed a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> in front of Vince's face and hit a Coast-to-Coast dropkick, pinning his father to win the match.|$|E

25|$|Conrad joined NASA {{as part of}} {{the second}} group of astronauts, known as the New Nine, on September 17, 1962. Regarded {{as one of the best}} pilots in the group, he was among the first of his group to be {{assigned}} a Gemini mission. As pilot of Gemini 5 he, along with his commander Gordon Cooper, set a new space endurance record of eight days. The duration of the Gemini 5 flight was actually 7 days 22 hours and 55 minutes, surpassing the then-current Russian record of five days. Eight days was the time required for the first manned lunar landing missions. Conrad facetiously referred to the Gemini 5 capsule as a flying <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E
25|$|Incinerators {{reduce the}} solid {{mass of the}} {{original}} waste by 80–85% and the volume (already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks) by 95–96%, depending on composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling. This means that while incineration does not completely replace landfilling, it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal. Garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills, {{the volume of the}} uncompressed <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by approximately 70% by using a stationary steel compressor, albeit with a significant energy cost. In many countries, simpler waste compaction is a common practice for compaction at landfills.|$|E

After being persuaded by Mimi, his ex-girlfriend, Benny gives the group back their apartment. Over the following year, Roger grows distrustful of Mimi, and their relationship ends ("Without You"). Angel's condition gets worse and she dies in Collins' arms. At Angel's funeral, the group goes their separate ways after a bitter argument ("I'll Cover You/Goodbye Love").|$|E

25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|European hornets {{have been}} given a {{reputation}} for being very aggressive. Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the yellow garden spider Argiope aurantia. Davis observed the hornets in Georgia fly into the spider’s web and appear entangled. Looking closer, the hornet was cutting free prey that had been caught by the spider’s web. The spider did not attack or interfere with V. crabro as it was stealing its prey. This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a <b>garbage</b> <b>can,</b> which is why they are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|E
25|$|After a {{backstage}} segment featuring Dorian Roldán, Jeff Jarrett, Karen Jarrett, Konnan and Kurt Angle, {{the fourth}} match {{of the event}} saw Joe Líder and Psicosis face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. Despite Psicosis announcing before the event that he would be betting his hair in case of a loss in the Parejas Suicidas match, it was announced that the match would be for Líder's hair and Psicosis' mask. However, before the match began, Líder attacked Psicosis and ripped his mask off, revealing his burned face and forcing the match to be changed to a Hair vs. Hair match. Towards the end of the hardcore brawl, Líder threw a <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> into Psisocis' face as he was climbing to the top rope. However, when Líder went to suplex his opponent back down to the ring, Psicosis countered the move and dropped him with a flip piledriver through a table and a ladder, both propped up against the corner, and then pinned him to win the match. Afterwards, Psicosis continued the assault on his rival, dropping him onto a pile of thumbtacks, before having him shaved bald. After getting backstage, Líder and Psicosis continued brawling in the locker room, before being broken up by security.|$|E
