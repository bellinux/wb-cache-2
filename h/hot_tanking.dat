40|$|AbstractDomestic <b>hot</b> water <b>tanks</b> {{represent}} a significant potential {{demand side management}} asset within energy systems. To operate effectively as energy storage devices, {{it is crucial that}} a stratified temperature distribution is maintained during operation; this paper details experimental and numerical work conducted to understand the influence that wall material specification has on de-stratification within domestic <b>hot</b> water <b>tanks.</b> A 2 d axisymmetric CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) model was consistent with experiments which showed that switching from copper to stainless steel resulted in a 2. 7 fold reduction in useable hot water loss through reduced de-stratification for a 74  L UK domestic <b>hot</b> water <b>tank</b> over a 48  h period. During simulation, a counter rotating convection system, with peak velocities of 0. 005  m/s, was observed above and below the thermocline. Minimizing de-stratification, through appropriate wall material selection, increases the performance of <b>hot</b> water <b>tanks</b> and scope for their use in demand side management applications. Given the inconclusive evidence surrounding copper's efficacy as a sanitizing agent, along with the low tensile strength of polyethylene, this paper advocates the use of stainless steel in <b>hot</b> water <b>tank</b> walls and further exploration of alternative materials and composites which have low cost and low thermal conductivity along with high strength and manufacturability...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of solar thermal power plants (STPPs) with molten salt as heat transfer fluid is the direct storage system. This means that the thermal energy collected by the solar field and the electric power generation can be fully decoupled. The plant operator must therefore make the daily decision when to start-up or to shut-down the power block (PB). Normally, the solar field of these STPPs is overdesigned which leads to dumping of solar energy during days with high solar radiation, due to the inability of the <b>hot</b> <b>tank</b> and the PB to consume all the collected thermal energy. The PB must therefore start as soon as possible to prevent excessive dumping of solar energy. Contrarily, on days with low solar radiation, the PB should not start too early to prevent a second start-up on this day, because of a low <b>hot</b> <b>tank</b> level. In order to operate within these counter bounds, a fixed and a dynamic operation strategy are proposed. The so-called solar-driven strategy serves as a reference. Using this strategy, the PB operates whenever the solar field is online. The two proposed operation strategies are compared to the reference strategy by means of a transient STPP simulation model. Using the dynamic operation strategy, the annual unnecessary PB start-ups and the auxiliary heater thermal energy for anti-freeze protection are decreased, whereas the annual net electricity is increased...|$|R

40|$|A {{steadily}} increasing fraction of Europe's electricity {{is generated by}} renewable and less reliable energy sources. It is therefore necessary to find smart ways to store excess energy until it is demanded. This could be achieved by using the energy storage potential in the <b>hot</b> water <b>tank.</b> The heating of <b>hot</b> water <b>tanks</b> can be improved by using a cost minimization strategy to make <b>hot</b> water <b>tanks</b> heat when electricity price is low and conserve energy when price is high. This would both provide economic benefits to {{the owner of the}} tank and, provided widespread use, a more stable energy market. This thesis considers the optimal operation of energy storage in buildings with focus on the <b>hot</b> water <b>tank.</b> The objective has been to minimize operational cost while still meeting the hot water demands of the end user. To achieve this, a <b>hot</b> water <b>tank</b> system has been modeled using Simulink and Matlab, and a feedback control structure implemented to stabilize the system. By using ideas from self-optimizing control the cost function has been simplified to a form that makes it solvable even with limited computation resources. The simplified problem has then been solved using an MPC-solver. The resulting optimized case (Case II) has been compared with a simple policy of heating for a set amount of hours at night (Case III) and holding a constant temperature in the tank (Case I). Based on the findings in this thesis, using optimization to find optimal energy levels in the tank does not give any significant benefit over using a simple policy of heating the tank at night. Though both cases are economically better than using a constant temperature set point, the difference is not huge. Compared to holding a constant temperature in the tank, Case II and Case III gave savings of 8. 61 % and 9. 12 % respectively. Actual implementation of the system could still be beneficial in areas with more pronounced price variation. Further work should be focused on improving the solver and verifying the closeness to optimality of the simplifications that have been made...|$|R
