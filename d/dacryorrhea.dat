40|$|A 52 -year-old {{man without}} {{underlying}} diseases visited {{a local hospital}} with symptoms of memory deficit and mild headache. Radiological examination of the brain with computed tomography (CT) revealed hydrocephalus. Etiology was not revealed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and a ventricular-atrial (V-A) shunt was installed. The patient had congestion and <b>dacryorrhea</b> of the right eye and uveitis was diagnosed three months after placement of the V-A shunt. The serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) tested positive at a titration of 64 times. Additionally, samples of the right eye anterior chamber aqueous humor (ACAH), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and prostate fluid were positive for Cryptococcus antigen at a titration of 128 times. In addition, Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was isolated from the peripheral blood, CSF and ACAH, resulting in a diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis. Fluconazole (FLCZ) at 800 mg/day was administered {{for the first two}} days, followed by a 400 mg/day maintenance dose. After six months of treatment, his visual power recovered. This is a rare case of disseminated cryptococcosis involving uveitis, which was successfully treated by FLCZ. Disseminated cryptococcosis should be considered in cases with mild symptoms and V-A shunt installation for hydrocephalus...|$|E
