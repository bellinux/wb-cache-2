500|$|I {{responded to}} all these songs on an {{emotional}} level, when I first heard them. I wanted songs <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell with my own voice, and interpret them authentically ... But {{it was important to}} maintain the emotional integrity and the heart of the song. It was a high priority to keep true to the songs.|$|E
500|$|For {{the music}} to , O'Donnell began work on {{crafting}} the game's themes before Salvatori joined the team in February 2009. [...] "Marty [...] had started writing before me, and sent me some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E

500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pilot Robert White {{commented on}} his high {{altitude}} X-15 flights, [...] "My flights to 217,000 feet [...] and 314,750 feet [...] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth's curvature... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!— the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California {{border in the}} area of Las Vegas, and this was how I described it: Looking to my left <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spit into the Gulf of California; looking to my right <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> toss a dime into San Francisco Bay." ...|$|E

However, former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers resigned from Cabinet after May {{offered her a}} post which was [...] "not one which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take on". Nearly half of the May ministry are women.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports. When asked about this at the hearing, Holsinger said, [...] "If I were faced with a situation that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not in good conscience do, I think I have a clear response to that.

2500|$|Justice Scalia {{was willing}} to accept that the Eighth Amendment {{contained}} a gross disproportionality requirement [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> intelligently apply it." [...] However, because a criminal sentence can have many justificationsnot simply retribution, a goal to which proportionality is inherently linked {{he thought it was}} impossible to intelligently apply a proportionality requirement to non-capital sentences. [...] Even so, Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment that Ewing's sentence was constitutional.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Collingwood {{completed}} his century, falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The last six Durham wickets then added 57 {{to leave them}} with a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had taken eight wickets {{in the first game}} but conceded 55 runs for no wicket in the first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the bowling unit performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to five for 61. Harmison later said, [...] "The way I was feeling, my tail was up and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around. Before the last ball , I felt confident. It was a decent ball in a decent area and I was glad when he [...] chopped it on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory. But I wasn't successful even at that. ...Before I walked into the courtroom my counsel told me to just enter a plea of guilty and keep my mouth shut afterward. I didn't even have a trial...|$|E

60|$|I was so irate at his audacity, so disgusted that {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear}} {{the sight of him}} any longer. I turned my back on him and walked out of my own private room, leaving him there still munching my sausage and drinking my Bordeaux.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, Barlow {{was unable to}} {{reconcile}} his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and [...] "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, {{he said that he}} was [...] "voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm". Barlow has subsequently declared that he is a Republican, most notably during an appearance on The Colbert Report on March 26, 2007, and has also claimed on many occasions to be an anarchist. Barlow has said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in the voting booth that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: [...] "I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes." [...] Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a [...] "thorough creep" [...] and [...] "toxic asshole" [...] in a Facebook [...] "micromanifesto".|$|E
2500|$|In May 1915, Sexton {{resigned}} after {{a disagreement}} with the Harvard Advisory Baseball Committee. Sexton said that he resigned because of interference from the Advisory Committee with his work as coach. [...] The dispute followed {{a decision by the}} committee to hire two former Harvard players as assistant coaches to work with the catchers and outfielders. [...] In a letter published by The Boston Evening Transcript, Sexton wrote that he did not agree to the many suggestions of the committee and concluded, [...] "After full consideration of the matter discussed, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not retain my self-respect and esteem owing to their persistent interference and continue as coach of the Harvard University baseball team." [...] The Evening Transcript wrote that Sexton was [...] "considered one of the most efficient in the country" [...] and opined that he [...] "has been a good coach for Harvard and has developed some excellent teams from very ordinary material." [...] The paper also reported that [...] "the players and the college in general have been very much upset over the resignation of Dr. Sexton." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
60|$|Theodore's attic, {{where he}} slept, {{was at the}} top of the house, whilst my room was on the ground floor, and so <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now go back quite comfortably to my office in the hope that more remunerative work and more lavish clients would come my way before nightfall.|$|R

2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes felt as if I had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|The play's {{main feature}} is its very eloquent, long, and {{authoritative}} dialogues, whereas {{the film is}} almost silent. Aravindan explains: [...] "There are some specific reasons for deciding to have sparse dialogues in Kanchana Sita. One, this episode taken from Ramayana is familiar to all. Two, Ramayana is not a supernatural reality for us, as it is ingrained in us. It is therefore not necessary to educate people about the film through lengthy dialogues. C. N. [...] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana. I {{did not think that}} Sita should come in the film {{in the form of a}} woman. That is why Sita appeared in the film as prakriti and Prakriti is a character in the film. When the emotions of Sita like pain, sadness, joy, and equanimity are manifested through the moods of Prakriti, dialogue becomes redundant. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make the film without dialogue. Rama committing suicide – (I still feel it was – self immolation) had haunted me very badly. With all these, my Kanchana Sita became very different. Words were required only for very essentials. The dialogues, which I used, were from C. N. 's play. The doubt I had then was whether my Rama and Lakshmana (as they were ordinary people) could use such an eloquent Sanskritised language." [...] In another interview, he said, [...] "Dialogues are there to carry on the storyline and make it move. But when it comes to well-known stories, dialogues ceases to be an essential ingredient." [...] Dialogue was, however, included in Kanchana Sita at the end of the movie to discuss the responsibilities of the king.|$|E

60|$|My heart {{gave one}} great leap in me, and broke into vehement throbbings, {{which made it}} {{impossible}} for me to say a word more. I reined up my horse, and fixed my eyes on Michael.

6000|$|... "Therefore, I {{think it}} in all ways best that you should return there, for the present.
