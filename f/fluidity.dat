5|$|Kinky Boots adds to {{the public}} {{discourse}} of gender, and its flexibility and <b>fluidity.</b> The prevalence of drag culture in mainstream media has introduced a step of separation between femininity and “being female”. While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of impersonation and identity can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E
5|$|A lyotropic {{liquid crystal}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide <b>fluidity</b> to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.|$|E
5|$|Chloi Rad (IGN) {{wrote that}} the game was {{theatrical}} and diorama-like in its display and attention to detail. Andrew Reiner (Game Informer) called its graphics among the best-looking smartphone games, from the vibrancy of its environments to the <b>fluidity</b> of its animations. While Rad felt that the game presented little challenge as a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay <b>fluidity,</b> allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral <b>fluidity,</b> high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune <b>fluidity,</b> surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual <b>fluidity</b> in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E
5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's <b>fluidity,</b> and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., <b>fluidity,</b> transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain <b>fluidity.</b> Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this <b>fluidity</b> or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social <b>fluidity</b> in the society.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art {{full-time}} under Kenneth Hayes Miller and Kimon Nicolaides at the Art Students League. Nevelson credited {{an exhibition}} of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{as a catalyst for}} her to study art further. In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike's birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann, who was serving as a guest instructor at the Art Students League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance. She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art that made her famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same <b>fluidity</b> seen in the works of Henri Matisse. Nevelson also created terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.|$|E

25|$|Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun {{occurs when}} the liquid metal does not {{completely}} fill the mold cavity, leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in the mold cavity, leaving a weak spot. Both are caused by either a lack of <b>fluidity</b> in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The <b>fluidity</b> can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is back pressure from improperly vented mold cavities.|$|E
25|$|Misruns {{and cold}} shuts {{are closely related}} and both involve the {{material}} freezing before it completely fills the mold cavity. These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The castability and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. <b>Fluidity</b> affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mold extremities. There are various ways of measuring the <b>fluidity</b> of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. <b>Fluidity</b> {{is affected by the}} composition of the material, freezing temperature or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mold; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material.|$|E
25|$|When {{a liquid}} is {{supercooled}} towards the glass transition, the viscosity increases dramatically. The liquid then becomes a viscoelastic medium that shows both the elasticity {{of a solid}} and the <b>fluidity</b> of a liquid, depending on the time scale of observation or on the frequency of perturbation.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol, {{given that}} it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is {{required}} to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane <b>fluidity</b> over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane <b>fluidity</b> and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells {{do not need to}} build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of pictorial pottery {{has been found}} on Cyprus, but it originates in the Peloponnese. It is most likely copied or inspired from the palace frescoes but the vase painters lacked the ability {{at this time to}} recreate the <b>fluidity</b> of the art.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fluidity</b> of Asturias' tales {{is a very}} {{important}} part of his literature.

25|$|Pāhoehoe is {{characterized}} by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows.

25|$|Two former {{employees}} of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They {{are known for}} creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the <b>fluidity</b> and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō's Mediatheque, with cool white acrylic sheets on the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store's contents. Their dynamic of <b>fluidity</b> is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, floating aluminium roof supported by slender columns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{musicology}} and ethnomusicology tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations.

25|$|The {{structure}} of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the <b>fluidity</b> of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a trans conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar. In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, hydrogen ions, and sodium ions.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that growth of Gram-negative {{bacteria}} in 20 mM Mg reduces the number of protein-to-lipopolysaccharide bonds by increasing the ratio of ionic to covalent bonds, which increases membrane <b>fluidity,</b> facilitating transformation. The role of lipopolysaccharides here are verified from the observation that shorter O-side chains are more effectively transformed – perhaps because of improved DNA accessibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiesel}} {{produced from}} {{the processing of}} microalgae differs from other forms of biodiesel {{in the content of}} polyunsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats are known for their ability to retain <b>fluidity</b> at lower temperatures. While this may seem like an advantage in production during the colder temperatures of the winter, the polyunsaturated fats result in lower stability during regular seasonal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Although Goldmark {{was never}} an ardent {{follower}} of Wagner, the orchestration of Die Königin von Saba {{is reminiscent of the}} effects and formal <b>fluidity</b> that characterized so much of Wagner's work.

The work also shows some influence of the dramatic sensibilities of Meyerbeer.|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cell cell {{membrane}} comprises a typical lipid bilayer, similar to what {{can be found in}} virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight.

25|$|Prior to 1883 the {{locality}} {{was known}} under various names and lacked any clear boundaries. The <b>fluidity</b> in district {{names in the}} colonial period reflected changes in the patterns of land use {{and access to the}} area as the process of colonisation proceeded. Names of nearby areas were sometimes vaguely associated with what became Carlingford and even after that name was settled usage remained fluid for a time.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} the <b>fluidity</b> of arterial-venous {{identity}} {{is that of the}} intersomitic vessel. At early stages, this vessel is connected to the aorta, making it part of the arterial network. However, sprouts from the cardiac vein may fuse with the intersomitic vessel, which slowly disconnects from the aorta and becomes a vein. This process is not fully understood, but may occur out of a need to balance mechanical forces such as pressure and perfusion.|$|E
25|$|Melamine also {{enters the}} {{fabrication}} of melamine poly-sulfonate used as superplasticizer for making high-resistance concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture {{to reduce the}} water content in concrete while increasing the <b>fluidity</b> and the workability of the mix during its handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.|$|E
