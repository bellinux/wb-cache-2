Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} minor actions {{followed}} as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway. After {{a month of}} fighting, the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the Japanese sued <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> hostilities came to an end. During the fighting in Borneo the 2/33rd had lost 25 dead and 57 wounded. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the war, the Australians remained on Borneo as an occupation force, while the Army was slowly demobilised. During this time the battalion was steadily reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for discharge, or were transferred to other units for further service, including providing personnel to the 34th Brigade, which was raised for occupation duties in Japan.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} in Wales was deteriorating. Henry had conducted a campaign in South Wales in 1108, pushing out royal {{power in the region}} and colonising the area around Pembroke with Flemings. By 1114, some of the resident Norman lords were under attack, while in Mid-Wales, Owain ap Cadwgan blinded one of the political hostages he was holding, and in North Wales Gruffudd ap Cynan threatened the power of the Earl of Chester. Henry sent three armies into Wales that year, with Gilbert Fitz Richard leading a force from the south, Alexander, King of Scotland, pressing from the north and Henry himself advancing into Mid-Wales. Owain and Gruffudd sued <b>for</b> <b>peace,</b> <b>and</b> Henry accepted a political compromise. Henry reinforced the Welsh Marches with his own appointees, strengthening the border territories.|$|E
