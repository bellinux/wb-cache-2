25|$|Plasma {{contains}} many {{species such as}} ions, free radicals and electrons, so it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what contributes to the polymerization process most. The first suggested process by Westwood et al. {{was that of a}} cationic polymerization, since in a direct current system polymerization occurs mainly on the cathode. However, more investigation has led to the belief that the mechanism is more of a radical polymerization process, since radicals tend to be trapped in the films, and termination can be overcome by reinitiation of oligomers. Other kinetic studies also appear to support this theory.|$|E
25|$|When {{addressing}} {{police brutality}} in Latvia, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the history}} of the country and how this affects its police and brutality towards the population. Latvia became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, being a voluntary force for the protection of public order. Policing during this period was quite successful, being assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.|$|E

25|$|They {{are usually}} {{caused by a}} {{bacterial}} infection. Often {{many different types of}} bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like, and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for deeper infection.|$|E
25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E
25|$|Most genes {{have more}} than one effect on the {{phenotype}} of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> beyond the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible character, yet a change in fitness is recorded. In such cases the gene's other (cryptic or 'physiological') effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many pleiotropic disorders, the connection between the gene defect and the various manifestations is neither obvious, nor well understood.|$|E
40|$|The 1990 s was {{a period}} of change in the crime level. Many large cities had {{significant}} decreases in the amount of crime. This research paper will look at two possible factors that might have influenced crime, particularly in this period. The death penalty and the number of police employed are <b>important</b> variables <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at because of the political impacts that can arise. The death penalty has long been debated about the significance it has over crime. Also, if the number of police can affect the crime rate, then it would be <b>important</b> <b>to</b> perhaps <b>look</b> at increases in the forces. Data from 1990 and 2000 will be used in a regression analysis of the possibilities that these two variables have over the crime rate. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

2500|$|Substitution, {{nucleophilic}} bimolecular {{reactions are}} concerted reactions where both the nucleophile and substrate {{are involved in}} the rate limiting step. Since this reaction is concerted, the reaction occurs in one step, where the bonds are broken, while new bonds are formed. Therefore, to interpret this reaction, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the transition state, which resembles the concerted rate limiting step. In the [...] "Depiction of SN2 Reaction" [...] figure, the nucleophile forms a new bond to the carbon, while the halide (L) bond is broken.|$|E
2500|$|Johannes Climacus, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, {{writes the}} {{following}} cryptic line: [...] "Subjectivity is Truth". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual who he is in distinction from others. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the unique relationship between the subject and object.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{behavioral}} modification, psychological {{therapy has}} a few distinct characteristics of its own. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the psychological status of a chronic headache sufferer to [...] "identify conditions that might interfere with headaches and treatments", such as depression. Also, psychological therapy suggests training in self-hypnosis. While hypnotized, patients are given suggestions to relax and use visual imagery to control headache mechanisms, which {{is very similar to}} relaxation therapy. Psychological therapists also analyze personal issues that may interfere in a chronic headache patient’s life, making him or her unable to make changes in lifestyle to improve headaches. Psychologist or psychiatric help for chronic headache patients is controversial, as a patient must be open to possible psychological factors in relation to headaches.|$|E

2500|$|What may be {{the cause}} of this [...] "leaky pipeline" [...] of women in the sciences? It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at factors outside of academia that are {{occurring}} in women's lives {{at the same time they}} are pursuing their continued education and career search. [...] The most outstanding factor that is occurring at this crucial time is family formation. As women are continuing their academic careers, they are also stepping into their new role as a wife and mother. [...] These traditionally require at large time commitment and presence outside work. [...] These new commitments do not fare well for the person looking to attain tenure. That is why women entering the family formation period of their life are 35% less likely to pursue tenure positions after receiving their PhD's than their male counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Within Stölzl’s {{first year}} at the Bauhaus, she began what she {{referred}} to as the “women’s department”, which due to the underlying gender roles within the school, eventually became synonymous with the weaving workshop. [...] Stölzl was very active within the weaving department and was immediately seen as a leader among the pack. [...] At the time, the department was putting emphasis on artistic expression and individual works that reflected the teachings and philosophies of the painters who served as Bauhaus masters. [...] The Weimar Bauhaus had a very relaxed atmosphere that was almost wholly dependent on the students teaching themselves and one another. [...] Unfortunately, Georg Muche, who {{was the head of the}} weaving workshop at the time, had very little interest in the craft itself. He saw weaving and other textile arts as ‘women’s work’ and thus was of very little help with the technical processes involved. [...] This meant the students were left to their own devices to figure out all technical aspects of a craft most had little experience working in. [...] Due to this set-up, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the Weimar era works visually as opposed to technically.|$|E
