5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{found in}} LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in the cancer cells, {{and it is}} presumed that the antibodies originally develop {{as a reaction to}} these cells. It has been suggested that the <b>immune</b> <b>reaction</b> to the cancer cells suppresses their growth and improves the prognosis from the cancer.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the <b>immune</b> <b>reaction</b> produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of pathogenic mechanisms is {{required in order to}} treat diseases. However, the mechanisms of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications are extremely complex. <b>Immune</b> <b>reactions</b> are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, while diabetes influences <b>immune</b> <b>reactions.</b> Furthermore, both diabetes and <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To address these issues, animal models are useful tools. So far, various animal models of diabetes have been developed in rats, which have advantages over mice models in terms of the larger volume of tissue samples and the variety of type 2 diabetes models. In this review, we introduce rat models of diabetes and summarize the <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> in diabetic rat models. Finally, we speculate on the relationship between <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> and diabetic episodes. For example, diabetes-prone Biobreeding rats, type 1 diabetes model rats, exhibit increased autoreactive cellular and inflammatory <b>immune</b> <b>reactions,</b> while Goto-Kakizaki rats, type 2 diabetes model rats, exhibit increased Th 2 reactions and attenuation of phagocytic activity. Investigation of immunological abnormalities in various diabetic rat models is useful for elucidating complicated mechanisms in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Studying immunological alterations, such as predominance of Th 1 / 17 or Th 2 cells, humoral immunity, and innate <b>immune</b> <b>reactions,</b> may improve understanding the structure of amplification circuits for diabetes in future studies...|$|R

25|$|Cases of {{traumatic}} insemination between {{animals of different species}} will sometimes provoke a possibly lethal <b>immune</b> <b>reaction.</b> A female Cimex lectularius traumatically inseminated {{by a male}} C. hemipterus will swell up at the site of insemination as the immune system responds to male ejaculates. In the process, the female's lifespan is reduced. In some cases, this <b>immune</b> <b>reaction</b> can be so massive as to be almost immediately fatal. A female Hesperocimex sonorensis will swell up, blacken, and die within 24–48 hours after being traumatically inseminated by a male H. cochimiensis.|$|E

2500|$|Metal {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a well-established}} phenomenon and is common, affecting about 10–15% of the population. Contact with metals can cause <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> such as skin hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although {{little is known}} about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of immunologic type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components.

40|$|Cell-mediated <b>immune</b> <b>reactions,</b> such as {{allogenic}} skin-graft {{rejection and}} PHA or MLC responses, and antibody synthesis against different antigens (sheep erythrocytes, Brucella antigen, bovine serum albumin) {{have been evaluated}} in rats suffering from experimentally-induced diabetes and in age-matched sham-treated controls. Cell-mediated <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> are strongly depressed diabetic rats. The cellularity of the thymus and of thymus-dependent areas {{and the number of}} peripheral blood lymphocytes is significantly reduced in pancreatectomized rats. Moreover, the immunological recovery from heavy cortisonization is also greatly impaired. Daily treatment with insulin may prevent these immunological alterations. By contrast, antibody responses in diabetic rats are not quantitatively altered in respect to either the number of antibody producing cells in the spleen or the circulating antibody titres. The discrepancy between the abnormality of cell-mediated <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> in diabetic rats and their physiological capacity to synthetize antibodies suggests that the sensitivity to an insulin-deprived environment is present only in a definite, although yet undefined, subpopulation of lymphoid cells rather than in the whole lymphoid system...|$|R

25|$|BCG {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of superficial forms of bladder cancer. Since the late 1970s, evidence has become available that instillation of BCG into the bladder is an effective form of immunotherapy in this disease.

Immunotherapy with BCG prevents recurrence in up to 67% of cases of superficial bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no clear}} obvious cause for {{scleroderma}} and systemic sclerosis.

25|$|Swimmer’s itch or cercarial dermatitis, is a {{short-term}} <b>immune</b> <b>reaction</b> {{occurring in the}} skin of humans that have been infected by water-borne schistosomatidae.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} {{recombinant protein}} drugs often cause <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> {{in the body}} which reduces their efficiency. Protein drugs can be PEGylated, (attachment of polyethylene glycol) to overcome this problem. PEGylation increases bioavailability by reduced <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> and decreased renal clearance [1]. So far the traditional approaches for PEGylation involve harsh reaction conditions which provide a heterogeneous product (PEG attached randomly to different sites) along {{with the formation of}} several byproducts. Due to heterogeneity, the PEGylated protein drug faces challenge for FDA approval. Therefore, there is an immense need to develop an approach which could generate a homogeneous PEGylated protein drug. |$|R
40|$|A {{description}} {{is made of}} renal lesions in rats induced by heterologous (rabbit) nephrotoxic serum with or without subsequent host <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> against it {{and the effects of}} <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> on the course of classical nephrotoxic serum (Masugi) nephritis are discussed. The disease was induced by injecting congenitally athymic ACI nude rats (rnu/rnu) and their normal heterozygous littermates (rnu/+) with rabbit anti-rat glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antiserum. In the autologous phase, rat IgG and immunoglobulins were localized in a linear pattern along capillary walls only in nephritic heterozygous rats. In the indirect plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay against rabbit immunoglobulins in the autologous phase, significantly more PFC could be detected in nephritic heterozygous rats than in nephritic nude rats. The nude and heterozygous rats were essentially the same with respect to the amount of urinary protein, histological change and clinical course. At least in classical nephrotoxic serum nephritis in rats, host <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> against GBM bound heterologous nephrotoxic serum were concluded to have no effect on the course of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{platelets}} {{are involved}} in a number of <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> and, by release of vasoactive amines and thromboplastic factor(s), may contribute to vascular injury and deposition of fibrin (1, 2). Platelet injury can be induced by bacterial endotoxins (3, 4) and immune complexes (5 - 7), both of which require complement, and by membrane-active bacterial toxins such as streptolysins O and S and staphylococcal alpha toxin, which act directly on the platelet membrane without the participation of complement (8). Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) ] a component of the cell wall of coagulasepositive staphylococci, is known to elicit a number of <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> such as Arthus-like reaction in rabbits and immediate skin hypersensitivity in humans (9, 10). SPA is unique among microbial products in that it inteiacts with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) rather than with the antigen-binding site on the Fab portion of the immunoglobulin molecule (11, 12), and fixes complement presumably {{as a result of this}} interaction (13).

25|$|The mesospermalege is a sac {{attached}} to the inner abdomen, under the ectospermalege. Sperm is injected through the male's penis into the mesospermalege. In some species, the ectospermalege directly connects to the ovaries – thus, sperm and ejaculate never enters the hemolymph and thus never trigger an <b>immune</b> <b>reaction.</b> (The exact characteristics of the spermalege vary widely across different species of bed bugs.) The spermalege are generally found only in females. However, males in the Afrocimex genus possess an ectospermalege. Sperm remains in the spermalege for approximately four hours; after two days, none remains.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} is not exactly known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host <b>immune</b> <b>reaction</b> (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{treatment}} with low doses of streptozotocin induces hyperglycaemia with concomitant lymphocytic infiltrations into pancreatic islets (insulitis) in several mouse strains. The transfer of cellular <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> against islet cells {{by means of}} spleen cells was tested in two congeneic and five allogeneic strain combinations. Donor mice were treated on 5 consecutive days with 40 mg streptozotocin per kg body weight. Three weeks later, 5 x 10 (7) live spleen cells were transferred into thymusless recipient mice. Insulitis which had developed in about 70 % of the donors was only transferable from C 57 B 1 / 6 J to congeneic thymusless mice. In a second congeneic and in all allogeneic strain combinations, cellular <b>immune</b> <b>reactions</b> against pancreatic islets could not be transferred. In none of the recipients of spleen cells from diabetic donors was hyperglycaemia observed.
