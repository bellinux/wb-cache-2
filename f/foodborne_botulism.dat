2500|$|Botulism can {{be spread}} in several {{different}} ways. [...] The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water.

40|$|A {{selective}} medium, Clostridium botulinum isolation (CBI) agar, {{was developed}} for the isolation of C. botulinum from human feces. This medium contains cycloserine (250 microgram/ml), sulfamethoxazole (76 microgram/ml), and trimethoprim (4 microgram/ml) as selective inhibitory agents. Qualitative tests indicated complete recovery of C. botulinum types A, B, F, and G on CBI medium. It was more difficult to recognize type G colonies on the medium because of their lack of lipase activity. Except for a few species of Clostridium, the growth of other obligate anaerobes and of the facultative anaerobes tested on CBI medium was suppressed. Quantitative studies of C. botulinum on the selective medium yielded counts comparable to those obtained on egg yolk agar control plates.

C. botulinum causes an often fatal <b>foodborne</b> illness, called <b>botulism.</b> Given that many of these bread and cake recipes {{have been shown to be}} low in acid, the major barriers to prevent microbial growth are limited to: (1) the dryness of the product and (2) the lack of oxygen inside the closed jar (because of vacuum seals).

40|$|Background: Thailand has {{had several}} <b>foodborne</b> {{outbreaks}} of <b>botulism,</b> {{one of the}} biggest being in 2006 when laboratory investigations identified the etiologic agent as Clostridium botulinum type A. Identification of the etiologic agent from outbreak samples is laborious using conventional microbiological methods and the neurotoxin mouse bioassay. Advances in molecular techniques have added enormous information regarding the etiology of outbreaks and characterization of isolates. We applied these methods in three outbreaks of botulism in Thailand in 2010. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 19 cases were involved (seven each in Lampang and Saraburi and five in Maehongson provinces). The first outbreak in Lampang province in April 2010 was associated with C. botulinum type F, which was detected by conventional methods. Outbreaks in Saraburi and Maehongson provinces occurred in May and December were due to C. botulinum type A 1 (B) and B that were identified by conventional methods and molecular techniques, respectively. The result of phylogenetic sequence analysis showed that C. botulinum type A 1 (B) strain Saraburi 2010 was close to strain Iwate 2007. Molecular analysis of the third outbreak in Maehongson province showed C. botulinum type B 8, which was different from B 1 –B 7 subtype. The nontoxic component genes of strain Maehongson 2010 revealed that ha 33, ha 17 and botR genes were close to strain Okra (B 1) while ha 70 and ntnh genes were close to strain 111 (B 2).

50|$|<b>Foodborne</b> <b>botulism</b> {{results from}} {{contaminated}} foodstuffs in which C. botulinum spores {{have been allowed}} to germinate and produce botulism toxin, and this typically occurs in canned non-acidic food substances. C. botulinum prefers low oxygen environments, and can therefore grow in canned foods. Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness, leading to paralysis that typically starts with the muscles of the face and then spreads towards the limbs. In severe forms, it leads to paralysis of the breathing muscles and causes respiratory failure. In view of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of botulism are treated as medical emergencies, and public health officials are usually involved to prevent further cases from the same source.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundOn 7 and 11 July 2007, health {{officials}} in Texas and Indiana, respectively, reported 4 possible cases of type A <b>foodborne</b> <b>botulism</b> to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <b>Foodborne</b> <b>botulism</b> {{is a rare}} and sometimes fatal illness caused by consuming foods containing botulinum neurotoxin. MethodsInvestigators reviewed patients 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 medical charts and food histories. Clinical specimens and food samples were tested for botulinum toxin and neurotoxin-producing Clostridium species. Investigators conducted inspections of the cannery that produced the implicated product. ResultsEight confirmed outbreak associated cases were identified from Indiana (n = 2), Texas (n = 3), and Ohio (n = 3). Botulinum toxin type A was identified in leftover chili sauce consumed by the Indiana patients and 1 of the Ohio patients. Cannery inspectors found violations of federal canned-food regulations that could have led to survival of Clostridium botulinum spores during sterilization. The company recalled 39 million cans of chili. Following the outbreak, the US Food and Drug Administration inspected other canneries with similar canning systems and issued warnings to the industry {{about the danger of}} C. botulinum and the importance of compliance with canned food manufacturing regulations. ConclusionsCommercially produced hot dog chili sauce caused these cases of type A botulism. This is the first US <b>foodborne</b> <b>botulism</b> outbreak involving a commercial cannery in > 30 years.
