2500|$|Emeralds {{in antiquity}} were mined by the Egyptians and in Austria, {{as well as}} Swat in {{northern}} Pakistan. A rare type of emerald known as a trapiche emerald is occasionally found in the mines of Colombia. A trapiche emerald exhibits a [...] "star" [...] pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a six-pointed radial pattern. It is named for the trapiche, a grinding wheel used to process sugarcane in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as Zambia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Russia. In the US, emeralds {{can be found in}} <b>Hiddenite,</b> North Carolina. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in the Yukon.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{specimens}} of the <b>hiddenite</b> variety of spodumene were recovered about 1879 near the tiny settlement of White Plains, west of Stony Point, Alexander County, North Carolina. According to contemporary accounts, {{a young man}} named Lackey brought them to the attention of J.A.D. Stephenson, a local merchant who was also an ardent collector of minerals. Initially, the yellowish to greenish-yellow hiddenites were thought to be gemmy diopside. Stephenson brought the discovery to the attention of exploration geologist William Earl Hidden, who had been commissioned by Thomas Edison to search for any sources of platinum in North Carolina (an effort that was, in and of itself, unsuccessful). Hidden sent samples of the odd green material to J. Lawrence Smith, a prominent chemist and mineralogist of Louisville, Kentucky. Smith correctly identified the specimens as being a variety of spodumene, and named them [...] "hiddenite" [...] in honor of Hidden. The community in which the gemstones were first found would later be renamed [...] "Hiddenite". During the hey-day of <b>hiddenite</b> mining in the 1880s and 1890s it was also known as [...] "lithia emerald". Hidden recognized the value of the emeralds and the potential of the new gemmy green spodumene. He acquired a tract of poor quality land, which was either the site of the initial discovery or near to it, for $1500. The Emerald and <b>Hiddenite</b> Mining Company was organized and excavations on the site quickly recovered loose hiddenites and emeralds in the red, gravelly clay. At a depth of about 26 feet they struck bedrock and soon were recovering hiddenites from solid rock. Oddly, period newspaper accounts and statements by George Frederick Kunz (1892) indicate that mining on the site was never undertaken as a full-time operation, but was only prosecuted a few weeks or months during the summer. Writing in 1892, Kunz described the <b>hiddenite</b> being recovered as [...] "always transparent, ranges from colorless (rare) to a light yellow, into a yellowish green, then into a deep yellow emerald green. Sometimes an entire crystal has a uniform green color, but generally one end is yellow and the other green." [...] Kunz noted that the finest crystal recovered prior to 1892 measured 68 mm tall, and could have cut a gem of 5.5ct estimated weight. The size of most cut gems were small, with a 2ct <b>hiddenite</b> in the Augustus C. Hamlin collection being considered among the finest of the large stones.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, an emerald of 1438 carat kg was uncovered, {{the largest}} yet found in North America. The stone {{was named the}} Stephenson Emerald in honor of John A. D.

50|$|Spodumene is a {{pyroxene}} mineral {{consisting of}} lithium aluminium inosilicate, LiAl(SiO3)2, {{and is a}} source of lithium. It occurs as colorless to yellowish, purplish, or lilac kunzite (see below), yellowish-green or emerald-green <b>hiddenite,</b> prismatic crystals, often of great size. Single crystals of 14.3 m in size are reported from the Black Hills of South Dakota, United States.|$|E
50|$|The Four Kings of Heaven {{appear in}} several musicals. In many of them, they are paired with the Sailor Soldiers. In musical adaptations {{of the last}} arc, the Four Kings are revived by Sailor Galaxia to work under her service, but in some {{versions}} they betray her. The musical Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin had a group that which called themselves the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven (Neo-Shiten'≈ç). The members of the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven were Kunzite, Hematite, <b>Hiddenite,</b> and Kalunite. Hematite, <b>Hiddenite,</b> and Kalunite looked identical to Zoisite, Nephrite and Jadeite respectively. In La Reconquista, the Four Kings of Heaven disguise themselves as a boy band known as Pandemic 4. The group consisted of Kunza, Jed, Nephra, and Zoi. The band appeared in the Pandemic Love game, in which they used the game to drain energy for Beryl, and had one song, Erosion Boy (Ir≈çjon B≈çi).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the North Carolina locality, <b>Hiddenite</b> has also been found in Brazil, China, and Madagascar. Green spodumene found in Afghanistan and Pakistan has excited modest amounts of controversy in the mineral and gemological communities with debate {{over whether or not}} it should be truly considered [...] "hiddenite" [...] as well as claims that the green coloration is induced by irradiation and is fugitive.|$|E
50|$|At the mine, {{more than}} 63 {{different}} types of gems and minerals can be found including emeralds, amethyst, sapphire, aquamarine, topaz, garnet, {{as well as the}} stone <b>Hiddenite,</b> which is a stone only found in this local area. The ways in which gems can be uncovered in this mine is by sluicing, creeking, or digging. Sluicing is the process of taking a small amount of dirt or soil removed from the mine and sifting through it with a stream of running water known as a sluiceway. As the dirt is washed down the trough, the larger pieces of gems, minerals, and other stones are left in the sifter.|$|E

40|$|Gem-quality alexandrite, <b>hiddenite</b> and kunzite, elbaite and topaz {{minerals}} {{were characterized}} through a multi-methodological investigation based on EMPA-WDS, LA-ICP-MS, and {{laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy}} (LIBS). With respect to the others, the latter technique enables a simultaneous multi-elemental composition without any sample preparation and the detection of light elements, such as Li, Be and B. The criteria for the choice of minerals were: (a) the presence of chromophore elements in minor contents and/or as traces; (b) the presence of light lithophile elements (Li, Be and B); (c) different crystal chemistry complexity. The results show that LIBS can be employed in mineralogical studies for the identification and characterization of minerals, and as a fast screening method to determine the chemical composition, including the chromophore and light lithophile elements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ¬†Jary and {{collation}} is {{an expression}} derived from narratives. It originally means "semantic solidarity and multi-significance". In fact, one of the idiomatic meanings of interpretation is matching words and verses with the events verses were said for and other external including people, conditions and requirement. Since the sophism is an expansive rang for multiplicity of meaning and since, Mowlavi is a famous theosophist, this article aims to investigate Qoranic interpretive verses based on Jary and collation. The main question is regarding Mowlavi‚Äôs style in using Qoranic interpretive metaphors. First, {{it is necessary to}} consider the semantics of interpretation and its triple methods. Next, Mowlavi‚Äôs interpretive metaphors are considered in lexical semantics, interpretation means returning to the origin. This word has been used seventeen times in fifteen verses in seven surahs. Generally, they are referred to as "interpretation in second saying in verb three" and "interpretation in dream" idiomatic semantics of interpretation: "interpretation is a real fact which Qoranic expressions and wisdoms are documented on it. Such a reality exists in the heart of all Qoranic verses, whether their original or their analogous. Such a reality does not come from their surface but it is from the <b>hiddenite</b> which is so high that cannot fit in to lexicon. God has entered them in to words to make human understand a small part of it (Tabatabai, 1982 : 75). ¬† Interpretation is based on 3 methods: 1. justifying analogous, 2. finding a way to the heart pf verses. 3 Jary and collation the word "Jary" refers to exact movement a long location (Mostafavi, 1999 : 77). The word "collation" means placing something on something else, {{in such a way that}} cover each other (Ibn Manzur, 19830. two notes should be considered: 1 -achiving semantic comprehensive ness, 2 - achieving external significant for Jary and collation. Right adjustment cases: 1 -expressing the general significance of words 2 -expressing the specific significance of words 3 -isolationg meaning and attributing specialty. 1 -expresshng the general significance of word: some narrative verses narrate the significance of a general concept. In shams divan such a coincident current is seen: we move toward date root like holy Mary because there are not any dates on willow (shams divan, 1 / 261). Mowlavi compares date root with the alimentary aspect, taken from the hidden world to which Theo sophists harbor from upbraid and enjoy gods food. it refers to the verse: when the time of delivery come, Mary move toward date root (surah Maryam, 23). 2 -expressing the specific significance of words: many Qoranic verses are considered specific and exact whether lexically or structurally and syntactically. There are no adverbs to give them specific significance, therefore, giving specific significance to each of them has got problem. Mowlavi‚Äôs poetry is filled with this adjustment technic. An example is provided here, which is Day light: because of this god said: I swear by Day light, and the heart of the prophet got luminous (Shams divan, 2 / 295). Mowlavi calls Prophet Mohammad: the clarifier, which is derived from the first verses of two Quranic surah: vaz-Zoha and vash-Shams. 3 -isolating meaning and attributing specialty: the late Mr. Tabatabai believes that "many of Qoranic verses resemble proverbs which do not refer to elementary cases and there are applied in cases which fit their decadence. ¬†This is one of the cases which refer to the coincident of holy Qoran (1983 : 2 / 72). Mowlavi has correctly applied this case: Christ‚Äôs breathe like one hundred heavens, this material body has become by his favor: wind is jealous of Christ‚Äôs breath in reviving (shams divan, 5 / 17). Mowlavi compares spares springs breeze to the revival aspect of Christ‚Äôs breath. Of course, revival is one of the miracles of Jesus Chris. But, according to the principle of Jary and collation, attributing it to springs breath which is one of the traits of God, is not contrary and it can be said that the poet has attributed the characteristic: I created something like a bird by soil, then I breathed in it, then it became a bird (surah Ale Emran, 49). ¬†Conclusion: Jary and collation in this article are considered for the adjustment of Qoranic verses which is based on semantic similarity with external cases including people and situations with specific rules. The basis of Jary and collation is the semantic solidarity and multiplicity of significance. One of the stylistic characteristics of Mowlavi in applying interpretive metaphors has triple degrees and it has many applications. He considers whim-oriented interpretation as invalid and recognizes the lauded interpretation which causes mobility and dose not negate the surface of words...|$|E
