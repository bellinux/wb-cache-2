25|$|Although {{people have}} fought fires since {{there have been}} {{valuable}} things to burn, the first instance of organized professionals combating structural fires occurred in Ancient Egypt. Likewise, fire fighters of the Roman Republic existed solely as privately organized and funded groups that operated more similarly to a business than a public service; however, during the Principate period Augustus revolutionized firefighting by calling {{for the creation of}} a <b>fire</b> <b>guard</b> that was trained, paid, and equipped by the state- the first truly public and professional firefighting service. Known as the Vigiles, they were organised into cohorts and also served as a night watch and city police force.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} was a 1918 motor car garage. At one end it contains restored horse-drawn vehicles. There is {{a reproduction of}} an 1890 garden seat omnibus, with wooden, slatted seats on top, like garden seats. These vehicles have not {{been used in the}} UK since 1931. This reproduction has hydraulic disc brakes for safety. There is a brougham, a 19th-century gentleman's light one-horse carriage. This design {{is said to have been}} named after Lord Chancellor Brougham in the early 19th century. There is also a steamer, or Shand Mason steam fire pump of ca.1880. A team of horses pulled it, and steam powered it, at 250 gallons per minute. Firemen could get it ready in 7 minutes. It was successful enough for the manufacturers to export it worldwide - for example to the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> - but it was expensive in coal and horses, and was superseded by motor pumps in ca.1900.|$|E

60|$|Beric's party skirted {{along the}} fire for some distance. At some points to {{windward}} {{of the flames}} efforts were still being made to prevent their spread, large numbers of men being employed in pulling down houses {{under the supervision of}} the <b>fire</b> <b>guard.</b> Bodies of troops guarded the entrances to all the streets, and kept back the crowd of sightseers, who had assembled from all parts of the city. Fearing that they might be impressed for the work of demolition, the Britons returned to the school. The familia, as the members of any school of this kind were called, were all assembled. Scopus was walking moodily up and down the gymnasium, but it was evident by the countenances of most of the men that they felt a deep satisfaction at the misfortune that had befallen Rome. From time to time Scopus ascended to the roof, or sent one of the men out to gather news, but it was always to the same effect, the fire was still spreading, and assuming every hour more serious proportions. Towards evening the flames had approached so closely, that Scopus gave orders for the men to take up the bundles that had already been made up, containing everything of any value in the school.|$|E

5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person single-player {{video game}} viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, minotaurs, hoplites, and sphinxes. Morpheus beasts, shades, banshees, <b>fire</b> <b>guards,</b> <b>fire</b> sentries, hyperion <b>guards,</b> and death knights were created {{specifically for the}} game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.|$|R

50|$|The Warsaw Fire Brigade {{was created}} on December 23, 1834, by the Administrative Council of the Kingdom of Poland. It {{was to be}} modeled after a similar {{fire-fighting}} unit created in Saint Petersburg only a year earlier. On February 6 of the following year Lt. Colonel Jan Robosz became the first Fire Chief of <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> in Warsaw. The organization of the unit ended on January 1, 1836, and it began its duty. Initially named <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> in Warsaw (Straż Ogniowa w Warszawie), in 1841 it was renamed to Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> (Warszawska Straż Ogniowa). The Guard was entitled with all maintenance duties in the city, including putting down fires and fire prevention, but also cleaning the chimneys and the streets. It was divided onto four departments, each of them responsible for a different borough of Warsaw. In 1851 an additional department was created for the borough of Mirów. In 1864 the Guards received the first steam engine-operated mobile pump, manufactured by a London-based F. Shand, Mason and Co. firm. The following year two additional vehicles arrived, thus making the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> one of the best-equipped fire units in continental Europe. The Guards also assisted {{in a number of}} experiments, among them in the tests of a carbonic acid fire extinguisher in 1869.|$|E

50|$|The Industrial Civil Defence Service was {{a similar}} {{organisation}} to the Civil Defence Corps, but separate from it.

The <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> Section manned fire points and smaller fire appliances. Each unit had its own control post, and groups of units could form a group control post. Group control posts and control posts in larger factories had the status of warden posts in their own right, whereas smaller units answered to their local Civil Defence Corps warden post.|$|E
