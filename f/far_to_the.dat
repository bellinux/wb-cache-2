5|$|After a curve to the northeast, CR149 passes {{under some}} power lines, {{intersecting}} with Cattall Road. There the highway {{turns to the}} north, and soon to the northeast, entering Livingston Manor. Immediately after entering the community, CR149 becomes more developed, with residential homes and commercial buildings now surrounding highway. After an intersection with Creamery Road, CR149 continues to the northeast through downtown Livingston Manor, ending at an intersection with CR178 (a former alignment of NY17). Interchange 98 on Route17 (the Quickway), is not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and is accessible via CR178 and CR81.|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland to intercept a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland was unable to launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E
6000|$|Better <b>far</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> publican, {{who stood}} afar off, and dare not lift {{up as much}} as his eyes toward heaven, but cried only, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.' Better <b>far</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> honest and devout soldier, who, when Jesus offered to come to his house, answered, 'Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof. But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.' ...|$|R

"I find a {{difficulty}} in reconciling <b>to</b> my mind <b>the</b> probability of Buddhist priests coming from <b>the</b> <b>far</b> east <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> west, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cold and then almost uninhabited wastes {{of the north}} of Scotland, and inscribing Hebrew words in the Ogham character of the Gaedhil of Erinn. Dr Moore's copy of the inscription is not correct." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} months of 116AD, Trajan {{captured}} the Persian city of Susa. When Sanatruces II of Parthia gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin Parthamaspates of Parthia betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} {{travellers}} were pilgrims. North-west of Banagher, on the Connacht side of the river, was the monastic establishment of Clonfert, with the more famous Clonmacnoise a short distance further north. Not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west {{on the same side}} was another monastic foundation, at Meelick. At Meelick, the three provinces, Leinster, Munster and Connacht meet and just south of Banagher in the direction of Birr, the four dioceses of Clonmacnoise, Meath, Killaloe and Clonfert meet.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{received}} the opening kickoff and pushed into Florida State territory. On third down, Chris Turner was sacked and Maryland {{was forced to}} punt. Florida State was held three-and-out and punted. The Terrapins again pushed down field, before, on fourth and four on the Florida State 27-yard line, elected to attempt a field goal. Obi Egekeze's 44-yard attempt went wide of the uprights <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of this junction, NY5 and NY92 meet I-481 {{by way of}} a {{cloverleaf}} interchange. East of the interchange, Genesee Street widens to six lanes (three in each direction) as it heads along {{a commercial}} strip anchored by a large plaza featuring a Wegmans Food Markets store. NY5 and NY92 split at the east end of the strip in the hamlet of Lyndon. While NY5 continues east along Genesee Street to Fayetteville, NY92 heads southeast along the two-lane Highbridge Road and bypasses Fayetteville to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} note is that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments {{has revealed that}} the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
50|$|The Himyarites {{rebelled against}} Qataban and {{eventually}} united Southwestern Arabia (Hejaz and Yemen), controlling the Red Sea {{as well as}} the coasts of the Gulf of Aden. From their capital city, Zafar (Thifar), the Himyarite kings launched successful military campaigns, and had stretched its domain at times as <b>far</b> east <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persian Gulf and as <b>far</b> north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arabian Desert.|$|R

5|$|Outside of Spencerport, NY31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward {{into the}} town of Gates. The route heads past {{residential}} neighborhoods {{to the north and}} mostly undeveloped land to the south as it enters the hamlet of Elmgrove, built up around NY31's junction with NY386. Not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, NY31 enters North Gates, a densely populated residential community near the northern town line of Gates. In the southeastern outskirts of the community, NY31 intersects Lyell and Howard Roads at a junction that once served as the western terminus of NY47 NY31 continues east from here as Lyell Avenue, meeting NY390 at an interchange immediately north of the route's larger interchange with I-490. Not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east is the Rochester city line, which NY31 crosses upon traversing the Erie Canal once again.|$|E
5|$|Taman Sari can {{be divided}} into four areas. The first area is the {{artificial}} lake Segaran located in the west. The second area is a bathing complex in the south of the Segaran lake, called the Umbul Binangun bathing complex. The third area, now completely gone, is the Pasarean Ledok Sari and Garjitawati Pool, located in the south of the bathing complex. The fourth area is {{the east side of the}} first and second area, which extend <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and to the southeast complex of Magangan.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, partly because they had arrived too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, but they landed 21,000 troops {{at the cost of}} only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began with}} the French army outnumbered. Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 guns for the {{impending}} battle, with about 7,000 troops under Davout still <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south {{in the direction of}} Vienna. The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.|$|E
5|$|The nor'easter struck {{about two}} months after the {{destructive}} Perfect Storm, and preceded another damaging storm in December 1992. The storm produced strong winds and high surf during a new moon, which resulted in astronomically high tides. Such tides caused coastal flooding and damage to dune systems. Due to its small size, the storm's impact was highly localized and did not spread <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the angel, but Christus apparently {{changed his mind about}} its execution.|$|E
