25|$|Similar {{results are}} seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were {{regarded}} as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a wrongful <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not. The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. Trover, which involved lost goods or those placed in a bailment, necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed to the defendant in trover.|$|E

40|$|In The MSC Amsterdam, cargo was misdelivered from a {{container}} yard, {{after it had}} been discharged from the carrier’s ship. The liability for such misdelivery has been long-established, but {{the importance of the}} case lies in its consideration of how a carrier can limit the amount. There is, in Longmore LJ’s judgment, a considered analysis of when the Hague or Hague-Visby regimes (including the package limitation) can extend beyond discharge, and of the ability of carriers alternatively to limit their liability for post-discharge misdelivery, by express contractual provision. There is lengthy consideration of the application of the Hague-Visby Rules to carriage from South Africa (a non-Contracting State which has nonetheless enacted legislation bringing the Rules into force), and of assessment of damages for conversion, where there is a significant market rise after the initial conversion, but during the period <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods...</b>|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{distinction}} between trover and conversion. Trover resolved the old procedural problem of wager of law which had developed {{as a form of}} licensed perjury, which made detinue unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant. Wager at law allowed testimony from many witnesses, who might {{have nothing to do with}} the actual litigation. In this sense, it was not much different from champerty and maintenance. Because trover sidestepped these old problems, there was an effort to expand it into many different forms. The legal device to accomplish this at first was to treat the allegation of losing the goods and then finding them as a fiction. This method was seen in several cases in the 17th century. [...] As a technical factor, the defendant was not permitted to deny losing and finding, so the only issues to be litigated were those of the plaintiff's right to possession and the conversion as an existent fact. With losing and finding no longer essential, trover became the standard remedy for any form of interference with a chattel. It entirely replaced detinue, which fell into complete disuse. It replaced trespass to chattels to such an extent that the former was rarely seen. In 1756, Lord Mansfield stated in Cooper v Chitty : Whenever trespass for taking goods will lie, that is, where they are taken wrongfully, trover will lie. Similar results are seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were regarded as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a wrongful <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not.
