5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, <b>hitching</b> a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is <b>hitching</b> a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hitching</b> racks, and a {{mounting}} platform {{similar to}} the one at the Spruceton trailhead, have been built and/or renovated recently.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adjustable}} loop {{forms of}} the rolling <b>hitch</b> and Magnus <b>hitch,</b> {{in addition to being}} called either of those two names, have also come to be known variously as the taut-line <b>hitch,</b> tent-line <b>hitch,</b> rigger's <b>hitch,</b> adjustable <b>hitch,</b> or midshipman's <b>hitch.</b> [...] These knots are generally shown as being based on one of three underlying hitches: two variants of the rolling <b>hitch</b> (ABOK #1734 and #1735) and the Magnus <b>hitch</b> (#1736).|$|R
50|$|One {{instance}} where a half <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber <b>hitch</b> to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. A timber <b>hitch</b> is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and a half <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the half <b>hitch</b> combined with a timber <b>hitch</b> is known as a killick <b>hitch</b> or kelleg <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lobster buoy <b>hitch</b> {{is similar}} to the {{buntline}} <b>hitch,</b> but made with a cow <b>hitch</b> around the standing part rather than a clove <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 1890s {{with the}} {{operation}} of granite stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and <b>hitching</b> posts, curb stones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, Temecula gained a place of importance as a shipping point for grain and cattle.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} renovations, DEC {{installed}} a pit privy in the nearby woods. Later that decade it improved the Spruceton Trail to better allow the equestrian use it already permitted. It added a <b>hitching</b> rack, drinking barrel and mounting chute at the summit near the tower, corresponding with similar facilities elsewhere along the trail and at the trailhead.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} days of {{colonisation}} horses and bullocks provided the pulling power for wagons, drays, coaches, cabs, vans, traps, gigs and carts of all dimensions. This gave rise to stable, blacksmith, farrier and saddlery businesses in the Papanui area. <b>Hitching</b> posts and water troughs were common place especially at 'watering holes' like the Papanui Hotel.|$|E
5000|$|The killick <b>hitch</b> [...] {{is a type}} of <b>hitch</b> knot used {{to attach}} a rope to oddly shaped objects. This knot is also known as the kelleg <b>hitch.</b> It is a {{combination}} of a timber <b>hitch</b> tied in conjunction with a half <b>hitch,</b> which is added to lend support and stability when pulling or hoisting the object; the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber <b>hitch</b> creates a timber <b>hitch</b> and a half <b>hitch,</b> known as a killick <b>hitch</b> when at sea. A killick is [...] "a small anchor or weight for mooring a boat, sometimes consisting of a stone secured by pieces of wood".|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the geometry of the <b>hitch</b> on the behaviour of the tractor and of the implement is theoretically analysed. Three-point <b>hitches</b> are compared to one-point <b>hitches.</b> In the vertical plane the possibility, when a three-point <b>hitch</b> is used, to position the virtual <b>hitch</b> point very low and very {{far ahead of the}} implement is found to be advantageous, together with its property to allow easy adjustment of the position of the virtual <b>hitch</b> point. In the horizontal plane, the tractional <b>hitch</b> point of a three-point <b>hitch</b> normally does not coincide with its directional <b>hitch</b> point. When a one-point <b>hitch</b> is used the tractional and the directional <b>hitch</b> points coincide. This very fundamental difference gives the three-point <b>hitch</b> some unique properties. Equations describing the angle deflection and the lateral deflection of both directional and non-directional implements are presented. They show that a non-directional implement's lateral deflection as well as its angle deflection when used on a hillside or when asymmetrically loaded, normally are much smaller when a three-point <b>hitch</b> is used than when a one-point <b>hitch</b> is used. An equation is also presented describing the return of an implement after a lateral deflection. The theory of a laterally mobile, but stable, front-mounted three-point <b>hitch</b> is presented...|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer <b>hitch.</b> Trailer <b>hitches</b> come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type <b>hitches</b> consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, <b>hitch</b> bike racks, cargo carriers, or other <b>hitch</b> mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar <b>hitches</b> are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket <b>hitch</b> accessories.|$|R
25|$|Several mite species (mainly in the genera Proctolaelaps, Tropicoseius and Rhinoseius, family Ascidae) {{have evolved}} a phoretic mode of life, {{climbing}} into the nostrils of hummingbirds that visit flowers and <b>hitching</b> a ride to other flowers where they can feed on the nectar. Hummingbird flower mites favour plants in the families of Heliconiaceae, Costaceae, Zingiberaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lobeliaceae and Ericaceae, members of which are associated with hummingbirds.|$|E
25|$|For a web {{series called}} Thumbs Up!, which {{has so far}} run for three seasons, Choe and Harry Kim were filmed hitchhiking and freight hopping from Los Angeles to Miami and Tijuana to Alaska, and then <b>hitching</b> across China from Beijing to Shenzen and the {{gambling}} mecca of Macau. A fourth season, in which Choe and Kim travel from San Francisco to New York, is currently in the works.|$|E
25|$|Horses needed attendants: <b>hitching</b> a six-horse field {{artillery}} team, for example, required six men working {{for at least}} an hour. Horse health deteriorated after only ten days of even moderate load, requiring frequent refits; recuperation took months and the replacement horses, in turn, needed time to get along with their teammates and handlers. Good stables around the front line were scarce, makeshift lodgings caused premature wear and disease. Refit of front-line horse units consumed eight to ten days, slowing down operations.|$|E
50|$|Two {{successive}} half <b>hitches</b> {{tied around}} an object {{makes up the}} common clove <b>hitch.</b> Two successive half <b>hitches</b> tied around the standing part of a rope is known as two half-hitches or double half <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was IH's {{answer to}} the three-point <b>hitch</b> {{developed}} years earlier by Harry Ferguson, and featured on Ford-Ferguson tractors. The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was first offered as an option on the Super C. Fast <b>Hitch</b> was then an option on the 100, 200, 300, and 400 and some later models. However, even the Fast <b>Hitch</b> had three incompatible variants (100—single prong, 200—two small prongs, 300/400—two large prongs). IH discontinued the Fast <b>Hitch</b> in the 1960s after the three-point <b>hitch</b> was standardized and adopted by all manufacturers. There are kits available {{from a variety of}} sources that will either convert a Fast <b>Hitch</b> to a three-point, or add a three-point <b>hitch</b> to tractors that originally only had a fixed drawbar.|$|R
50|$|The running highwayman's <b>hitch,</b> mooring <b>hitch,</b> or {{sliding sheet}} bend is a <b>hitch</b> knot tied by looping {{the end of}} the rope around an object, and then fixing it to the {{standing}} part with a highwayman's <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
25|$|When Guy Murchie {{graduated}} from Harvard in 1929, {{he set out}} on an overseas journey, not even bothering to attend commencement, packing notepads in anticipation of publishing a travelogue. He began by working as an able-bodied seaman through the Panama Canal and up to Alaska, working the rails up to Whitehorse, and rowing himself down the Yukon River, then hiking, <b>hitching</b> a ride, and riding freight trains down to Seward. Unable to buy a ticket, he stowed away back to San Francisco, ultimately having {{to pay for the}} ride, and from there joined ship's crews to Hawaii and then to Japan.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{ended the}} subcontinental {{part of the}} tour with victory over Ceylon by an innings and 44 runs. Not wanting to wait {{a month for the}} next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians {{returned}} to Perth by <b>hitching</b> a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so {{that they would not be}} stuck in India for another six months, so the Australian team sat on the floor of the aircraft. They made it back to Australia despite suffering engine trouble and an overloaded plane.|$|E
25|$|The Montgomery {{building}} had one ground-level {{floor with a}} false front added to make the building appear taller. The false front was topped by a bracketed cornice typical of the Italianate style popular at the time. This created {{the impression that the}} building was larger and housed more businesses and people, similar to the main commercial streets found in eastern American towns. In front of the original structure there was a wooden sidewalk covered by a wooden roof and <b>hitching</b> posts for horses. It is known exactly what the exterior of the Montgomery building looked like in 1882 from a photograph taken by F. Parker who documented many of the changes taking place in the city during that period.|$|E
50|$|The magnus <b>hitch</b> is a knot {{similar to}} a rolling <b>hitch</b> or clove <b>hitch,</b> used to tie a rope or line to a pole, spar, or another line. It is tied {{similarly}} to a rolling <b>hitch</b> but with the final <b>hitch</b> in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug up, since both lines emerge from {{the same side of}} the <b>hitch,</b> but it has less tendency to twist under load.|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s, L'Amour {{intended}} {{to build a}} working town typical of those of the 19th century Western frontier, with buildings with false fronts situated in rows {{on either side of}} an unpaved main street and flanked by wide boardwalks before which, at various intervals, were watering troughs and <b>hitching</b> posts. The town, to be named Shalako after the protagonist of one of L'Amour's novels, was to have featured shops and other businesses that were typical of such towns: a barber shop, a hotel, a dry goods store, one or more saloons, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, etc. It would have offered itself as a filming location for Hollywood motion pictures concerning the Wild West. However, funding for the project fell through, and Shalako was never built.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen {{people were}} killed: Smith, the two others aboard the bomber (Staff Sergeant Christopher Domitrovich and Albert Perna, a Navy {{aviation}} machinist's friend <b>hitching</b> a ride), and eleven {{others in the}} building. Smith was not found until two days later, when search crews discovered that his body had gone through an elevator shaft and fallen to the bottom. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver was injured. Rescuers decided to transport her on an elevator {{that they did not}} know had weakened cables. The cables snapped and the elevator fell 75 stories, ending up in the basements. Oliver managed to survive the fall and rescuers later found her amongst the rubble. It still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hitching</b> a {{ride with}} an old fisherman, Drachma, and his ship, the trio recover the Red Moon Crystal from a temple in the desert nation of Nasr and the Green Moon Crystal high above Ixa'taka, a {{continent}} of lush forests while foiling Valuan operations. However, Vyse is separated from Aika and Fina when Drachma's ship is severely damaged in a Valuan attack. Vyse ends up stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he manages to uncover letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking a great treasure. Vyse is later found by a fellow Blue Rogue named Gilder, who takes him aboard to help him search for his friends. Meanwhile, Aika and Fina {{end up in the}} care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse read up on, and the three soon reunite, but are then captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans' prison fortress. By enlisting the aid of the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government's tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship named the Delphinus, the Blue Rogues are able to escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, upon which he formally establishes a base of operations and living quarters for he and his fellow shipmates.|$|E
50|$|The Slippery <b>hitch</b> and Buntline <b>hitch</b> are {{essentially}} a slipped Clove <b>hitch</b> around the main part. Slippery <b>hitch</b> has the slip {{placed under the}} last {{turn away from the}} main part, while Buntline <b>hitch</b> has the slip placed under the last turn towards the main part. Easy to tie, secure, easy to untie, Slippery <b>hitch</b> is used several in a row on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind stowed sails to the yards on top, while Buntline <b>hitch,</b> stronger but more difficult to untie, is used slipped to secure the bottom of open sail.|$|R

500|$|The {{style of}} Howling Bells was greatly {{influenced}} by film. The Steins and Picchio have expressed admiration of French films in particular. Juanita has stated that she enjoyed bringing the strange and ethereal energy from those films into their music. To describe the sound of Howling Bells' debut album, critics used terms like dark, brooding, and Americana. NME described it as [...] "the sound of PJ Harvey <b>hitching</b> a ride with The Velvet Underground through Twin Peaks." ...|$|E
500|$|A further {{improvement}} was managed by altering {{the arrangement of}} the teams; by <b>hitching</b> horses one behind the other, rather than side by side, weight could be distributed more evenly, and pulling power increased. This increase in horse power is demonstrated in the building accounts of Troyes, which show carters hauling stone from quarries [...] distant; the carts weighed, on average, , on which [...] of stone was regularly loaded, sometimes increasing to [...] – a significant increase from Roman-era loads.|$|E
500|$|After the {{courthouse}} was completed, {{it was discovered}} that some modifications were needed for its plumbing and heating system. [...] Outside of {{the courthouse}}, steps were also taken to beautify the surrounding grounds. [...] Sidewalks were added, and eventually <b>hitching</b> racks for horses. [...] A war memorial was added to the northeast corner of the courthouse grounds in 1921, and this {{was the first of the}} major war memorials that occupy the corners of the courthouse lawn. [...] A total of nine memorials, monuments and commemorative plaques have been added to the grounds within the courthouse square.|$|E
