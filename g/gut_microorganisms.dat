40|$|SummaryThe {{mammalian}} {{gastrointestinal tract}} harbors a complex ecosystem consisting of countless bacteria in homeostasis with the host immune system. Shaped by evolution, this partnership has potential for symbiotic benefit. However, {{the identities of}} bacterial molecules mediating symbiosis remain undefined. Here we show that, during colonization of animals with the ubiquitous <b>gut</b> <b>microorganism</b> Bacteroides fragilis, a bacterial polysaccharide (PSA) directs the cellular and physical maturation of the developing immune system. Comparison with germ-free animals reveals that the immunomodulatory activities of PSA during B. fragilis colonization include correcting systemic T cell deficiencies and TH 1 /TH 2 imbalances and directing lymphoid organogenesis. A PSA mutant of B. fragilis does not restore these immunologic functions. PSA presented by intestinal dendritic cells activates CD 4 + T cells and elicits appropriate cytokine production. These findings provide a molecular basis for host-bacterial symbiosis and reveal the archetypal molecule of commensal bacteria that mediates development of the host immune system...|$|R

40|$|Scope: To advance {{knowledge}} of the stress tolerance mechanisms of a probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strain to dietary hydroxycinnamic acids {{and the role of}} <b>gut</b> commensal <b>microorganisms</b> in the bioactivation of polyphenols. Methods and results: To understand how <b>gut</b> commensal <b>microorganisms</b> tolerate toxicity of hydroxycinnamic acids and bioactivate these compounds, we used whole genome transcriptional profiling to characterize the response of a L. plantarum human isolate during challenge with p-coumaric acid (p-CA). The transcriptional profile reveals a massive induction of genes involved in stress resistance and detoxification-related functions and a global shutdown of growth-associated processes. A specific oxidative stress response, including a large reshape of nitrogen metabolism toward methionine production, was induced, probably to counteract a p-CA-induced oxidative protein stress. The transcriptional datasets revealed overlapping behaviors with the response of L. plantarum to the gut environment. Conclusion: Contact with p-CA triggers responses that would be potentially beneficial for the intestinal function such as detoxification of dietary hydroxycinnamic acids and induction of a marked antioxidant response. Elicited responses indicated that contact with p-CA could provide preparedness to L. plantarum for adaptation to the gut environment. This knowledge facilitates the way to design methods to improve probiotic cell survival in this habitat. Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|Symbioses with <b>gut</b> <b>microorganisms</b> {{provides}} {{a means by which}} terrestrial herbivores are able to obtain energy. These microorganisms ferment cell wall materials of plants to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are then absorbed and used by the host animal. Many marine herbivorous fishes contain SCFA (predominantly acetate) in their hindgut, indicative of gut microbial activity, but rates of SCFA production have not been measured. Such information is an important prerequisite to understanding the contribution that <b>gut</b> <b>microorganisms</b> make in satisfying the energy needs of the fish. We have estimated the rates of acetate production in the gut of three species of temperate marine herbivorous fish from northeastern New Zealand: Kyphosus sydneyanus (family Kyphosidae), Odax pullus (family Odacidae), and Aplodactylus arctidens (family Aplodactylidae). Ex vivo preparations of freshly caught fish were maintained with their respiratory and circulatory systems intact, radiolabeled acetate was injected into ligated hindgut sections, and gut fluid was sampled at 20 -min intervals for 2 h. Ranges for acetate turnover in the hindguts of the studied species were determined from the slope of plots as the log of the specific radioactivity of acetate versus time and pool size, expressed on a nanomole per milliliter per minute basis. Values were 450 to 570 (K. sydneyanus), 373 to 551 (O. pullus), and 130 to 312 (A. arctidens). These rates are comparable to those found in the guts of herbivorous reptiles and mammals. To determine the contribution of metabolic pathways to the fate of acetate, rates of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were measured in the fore-, mid-, and hindgut sections of the three fish species. Both rates increased from the distal to proximal end of the hindgut, where sulfate reduction accounted for only a small proportion (50 -fold. When gut size was taken into account, acetate uptake from the hindgut of the fish species, determined on a millimole per day per kilogram of body weight basis, was 70 (K. sydneyanus), 18 (O. pullus), and 10 (A. arctidens) ...|$|E

Early alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonates has been linked with subsequent development of asthma and atopy in older children. Here we describe high-resolution culture-independent analysis of stool samples from 6 -month old infants fed daily supplements of Lactobacillus casei subsp.

Bacterial community composition was examined using a highdensity microarray, the 16 S rRNA PhyloChip, and the microbial assemblages of infants with either high or low LGG abundance were compared. Communities with high abundance of LGG exhibited promotion of phylogenetically clustered taxa including a number of other known probiotic species, and were significantly more even in their distribution of community members. Ecologically, these aspects are characteristic of communities that are more resistant to perturbation and outgrowth of pathogens. PhyloChip analysis also permitted identification of taxa negatively correlated with LGG abundance that have previously been associated with atopy, as well as those positively correlated that may prove useful alternative targets for investigation as alternative probiotic species.

Here, we use Drosophila to demonstrate substantial among-genotype variation in the effects of eliminating the gut microbiota on five host nutritional indices (weight, and protein, lipid, glucose and glycogen contents); this includes variation in both the magnitude and direction of microbiota-dependent effects. Genome-wide associations to identify the genetic basis of the microbiota-dependent variation reveal polymorphisms in largely non-overlapping sets of genes associated with variation in the nutritional traits, including strong representation of conserved genes functioning in signaling. Key genes identified by the GWA study are validated by loss-of-function mutations that altered microbiota-dependent nutritional effects. We conclude that the microbiota interacts with the animal at multiple points in the signaling and regulatory networks that determine animal nutrition.

40|$|To explore {{coevolution}} {{between the}} gut microbiota and the {{humoral immune system}} of the host, we used chickens as the model organism. The host populations were two lines (HAS and LAS) developed from a common founder that had undergone 40 generations of divergent selection for antibody titers to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and two relaxed sublines (HAR and LAR). Analysis revealed that microevolution of host humoral immunity contributed to the composition of gut microbiota at the taxa level. Relaxing selection enriched some microorganisms whose functions were opposite to host immunity.
