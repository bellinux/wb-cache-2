5|$|The {{subsequent}} {{photograph by}} Ray Lussier of a horizontal Orr <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> his arms raised in victory – {{he had been}} tripped by Blues' defenceman Noel Picard after scoring the goal – {{has become one of}} the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time—and today is highlighted in the opening sequence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Hockey Night in Canada telecasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
60|$|The monster {{had just}} awakened, and rising to his fore-legs and shaking himself, {{he said that}} he was ready to go into the town. The Minor Canon, therefore, walked back, <b>the</b> Griffin <b>flying</b> slowly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> at a short {{distance}} above the head of his guide. Not a person was to be seen in the streets, and they proceeded directly to the front of the church, where the Minor Canon pointed out the stone griffin.|$|R
50|$|When {{the father}} of the young Olof Persson (Eddie Axberg) becomes ill, he starts taking jobs as a working class Swede. His first job is log driving, where he meets a man named August (Allan Edwall). August tells Olof about death, and a {{flashback}} tale with August's wife chasing their twin sons, all of who are now deceased, is played. Olof finds a dead moth while working. He picks it up and pretends that it is alive, <b>flying</b> it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{the lads}} {{were all of}} one mind, the biplane was headed in the {{direction}} of Hope. As before, <b>the</b> <b>flying</b> machine swung <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at a good rate of speed, and half an hour before sundown they came in sight of the Seminary buildings.|$|R
5|$|Returning to the hotel, Moon {{started a}} food fight and soon cake began <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The drummer knocked out {{part of his}} front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an {{anaesthetic}} (due to his inebriation) before removing {{the remainder of the}} tooth. Back at the hotel a mêlée erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a limited}} number of effects and, aside from brief {{ballpark}} jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E

5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
25|$|A Steadicam rig was {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it {{gave the impression of}} <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at perilous speeds.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the ground}} gave rich and oozy under my feet; but I was desperate and went headlong into it, {{struggled}} through kneedeep, and so {{came to a}} winding path among tall canes. The noise of my pursuers passed away to my left. In one place three strange, pink, hopping animals, {{about the size of}} cats, bolted before my footsteps. This pathway ran up hill, across another open space covered with white incrustation, and plunged into a canebrake again. Then suddenly it turned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,--turned with an unexpected abruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I never saw this drop until I was <b>flying</b> headlong <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 467 performers, each {{wearing one}} of the 5 Olympic colours, created a 20 meter tall ski jumper formation, after the playing of the Italian {{national}} anthem. The choreography showed an animated ski jumper gliding down <b>the</b> take-off slope, <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night <b>air</b> and eventually landing safely in perfect form on the ground. Puffs of air {{could be seen as}} the jumper prepared his jump. Performers carrying a blue banner then entered to show the skier gliding down the slope. In flight the figure was lit up by headlamp flashlights in a formation of a ski jumper in peak flight. The ski jumper eventually made a graceful landing on the ground as performers released confetti (to represent a snowplow stop) and cheered as the segment came to a close.|$|R
60|$|So {{next morning}} he bade them farewell, though the princess begged him to stay with all her might; and when she found {{that she could not}} persuade him she gave him as a remembrance a gold ring. This ring was still more useful than the box, because when one wished oneself at any place one was there directly, without even the trouble of <b>flying</b> to it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> prince put it on his finger, and thanking her heartily, went his way.|$|R
25|$|A bird or bat <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at a {{constant}} speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. Pterosaur flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} is more {{resistant}} to sheer overpressure than most buildings, however, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure, as in a hurricane, are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing debris at high velocity, both with lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings. For example, Sumiteru Taniguchi recounts that, while clinging to the tremoring road surface after the Fat Man detonation, he witnessing another child being blown away, the destruction of buildings around him and stones <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Similarly, Akihiro Takahashi and his classmates were blown by the blast of Little Boy by {{a distance of about}} 10 meters, having survived due to not colliding with any walls etc. during his flight through the air, Likewise, Katsuichi Hosoya has a near identical testimony.|$|E
25|$|Roebuck {{was born}} in the village of Oddington, outside Oxford, on 6 March 1956, the son of two schoolteachers and one of six children; he {{attended}} Millfield School where his mother was a mathematics teacher and his father an economics teacher. The headmaster, Jack Meyer, a former Somerset CCC Captain, had offered his parents employment at the school so that they could afford the fees. Meyer was an unconventional headmaster who wanted to encourage cricket talent. On entering Meyer's office for the interview for admission, Roebuck found an orange <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> towards him; he caught it, and in his book It Never Rains speculated whether he would have got into Millfield if he had dropped it. He later studied law at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge, graduating with first class honours in 1977. However he never practised law, finding it too confining.|$|E

50|$|In The Fifth Element, set in 2263 New York City, flying {{cars are}} used as main mean of transportation. The {{production}} design for the film was developed by French comics creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières. Mézières wrote the book The Circles of Power, which features a character named S'Traks, who drives a <b>flying</b> taxicab <b>through</b> <b>the</b> congested <b>air</b> traffic of <b>the</b> vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Besson read the book and was inspired to change the Dallas character to a taxicab driver who flies through a futuristic New York City.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he entered}} the inn and ate a hearty meal. As he {{appeared}} at the door he saw several men gathered near. With a single spring he threw himself into the saddle, just as a rush forward was made by those standing round. The man next to him sprang upon him, and endeavored to drag him from the saddle. Cuthbert drew the little dagger called a miséricorde from his belt, and plunged it into his throat. Then seizing the short mace which hung at the saddlebow, he hurled it with all his force full {{in the face of}} his enemy, the page of Sir Philip, who was rushing upon him sword in hand. The heavy weapon struck him fairly between the eyes, and with a cry he fell back, his face completely smashed in by the blow, the sword which he held uplifted to strike <b>flying</b> far <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
25|$|Luzatti’s {{original}} verse {{story in}} Italian {{is about the}} plight of a beautiful maiden called Biancofiore – White Flower, or Blanchefleur – and her brave hero, Captain Rinaldo, and Ricardo and his paladins – the term used for Christian knights engaged in Crusades against the Saracens and Moore. Battling with these good people are the wicked Moors – North African Muslims and Arabs – and their Sultan, in Jerusalem. With the assistance of the wicked and treacherous magician, Gano of Maganz, Biancofiore is stolen from her fortress castle, and taken to become the reluctant wife of the Sultan. The catalyst for victory is the good magician, Urlubulu, who lives in a lake, and flies through the air {{on the back of his}} magic blue bird. The English translators, using the original illustrations, and the basic rhyme patterns, slightly simplify the plot, changing the Christians-versus-Muslim-Moors conflict into a battle between good and bad magicians and between golden knights and green knights. The French traitor in The Song of Roland, who is actually Roland’s cowardly step-father, is Ganelon – very likely the inspiration for Luzzati’s traitor and wicked magician, Gano. Orlando Furioso (literally, Furious or Enraged Orlando, or Roland), includes Orlando’s cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who, like Orlando, is also in love with Angelica, a pagan princess. Rinaldo is, of course, the Italian equivalent of Ronald. <b>Flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> on the back of a magic bird is equivalent to flying on a magic hippogriff.|$|E
500|$|Rudolf Simek {{says that}} the {{etymology}} that Snorri presents in Gylfaginning for the name Gná may not be correct, yet {{it is unclear what}} the name may otherwise mean, though Gná has also been etymologically theorized as a [...] "goddess of fullness."

40|$|A child takes {{a running}} start, {{grabs hold of}} the free-hanging end of a rope {{at the edge of}} a water hole at 0 x, swings upward, and lets go of the rope at some point, <b>flying</b> freely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> until he lands in the water at x R. For small initial speeds, the maximum range R is {{obtained}} by releasing the rope just short of its turning point and dropping almost straight down into the water from rest. On the other hand, as a child’s running speed gets larger and larger (compared to the square root of the product of the length of the rope and earth’s gravitational field), the rope should be released at an angle of about / 4 to maximize the range. That is, the optimum trajectory of a child is dominated by pendulum motion at low running speeds and by projectile motion at high initial speeds...|$|R
50|$|In The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon, Spyro and Cynder are {{released}} from the crystal by their enemy's minions. They are attached by magic snakes and are attacked by a giant golem and must escape {{with the help of}} Hunter. They find out that Malefor, the Dark Master, has escaped and later released the Destroyer, a beast capable of destroying the world. They must travel to <b>the</b> Dragon city <b>through</b> <b>the</b> enchanted forest and then through Avalar (where they rescue Meadow, a cheetah from Hunter the Cheetah's village). They then arrive at the Dragon city and must help protect the city and save the mole people. He and the four elder dragons slow down the beast, then Spyro and Cynder confront the Dark Master. During the battle, the three of them fall {{into the center of the}} earth, where Malefor is defeated. From there, Spyro repairs the damage the Destroyer caused to the planet, and he and Cynder are later seen <b>flying</b> together <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> toward <b>the</b> end of the game.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "HeartBreaker" [...] parodies old sci-fi films, as it commences with a low-budget <b>flying</b> saucer {{hovering}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and abducting a cow. The scene then cuts to inside the saucer, where the Teriyaki Boyz materialize and begin performing, with Nigo {{in the center}} on the turntable. Throughout the song, each of the Teriyaki Boyz are introduced one by one using caption for their individual verses and don a variety of Bape outfits. As they perform, random objects appear within the room, including a bottle of champagne, a plastic chicken, the aforementioned cow, and car and young woman, both wearing Bape-style camouflage. The video also parodies rockabilly music, having certain scenes feature the group playing and swinging to guitars while stereotypically dressed in matching suits and dark sunglasses. The music video concludes with the flying saucer lifting off and disappearing into the night sky.|$|R
6000|$|He groped about {{among the}} tombs that {{ran down the}} gorge, seeking vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long time {{he came to the}} {{entrance}} of the big mausoleum-like building from which the heads had issued. In this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into the centre of the place. Round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him. While he was still wondering at the purport of these things, he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street. He ran out into the darkness again, but he could see nothing. He had a mind to pull the bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the footsteps. But, although he ran far, he never overtook them; and his shouting was of no avail. The gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance. It was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices. There were none of the heads, now, below. They were all, it seemed, busily occupied along the upper slopes. Looking up, he saw them drifting hither and thither, some hovering stationary, some <b>flying</b> swiftly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> It reminded him, he said, of [...] "big snowflakes"; only these were black and pale green.|$|R

They were crossing the street. This would put him on the inside. He should be on the outside. Should he therefore drop her arm and change over? And if he did so, would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time? And the next? There was something wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about and play the fool. Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found himself on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly, making a show of being carried away by what he was saying, so that, in case he was wrong in not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.|$|R
