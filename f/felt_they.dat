5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had {{the proper}} {{equipment}} for the mission. In {{the early hours of}} Monday morning, June 25 – and despite discovering signs of life – rescue work was suspended due to the danger of additional concrete falling on the potential survivors and the HUSAR rescuers.|$|E
5|$|Jacob made {{no effort}} to solicit members for his commune other than through his {{newspapers}} and sometimes rejected applicants when he <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were not fit candidates. The commune attracted only about a dozen residents – mostly from outside the Ohio area.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the photos}} present {{throughout}} the Winchester home were photoshopped by graphic artist Mary-Ann Liu. Each one was discussed and refined, as Kripke <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were important to show the new Winchester family history. Some pictures, such as Dean at the prom and Sam at graduation, were edited versions of photos from Ackles' and Padalecki's childhood.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the last}} month, {{one third of}} {{participants}} (32%) <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> are nervous and stressed, and 32% <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> cannot cope with things they have to do.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> had no {{particular}} loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians generally supported {{the war effort}} as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> stronger ties to the British Empire. [...] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones.|$|R
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film described how they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E
50|$|The {{dogmatism}} of the Puritan divines, {{with their}} anti-rationalist demands, was, <b>they</b> <b>felt,</b> incorrect. <b>They</b> also <b>felt</b> that the Calvinist insistence on individual revelation left God uninvolved {{with the majority}} of mankind. At the same time, they were reacting against the reductive materialist writings of Thomas Hobbes. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that the latter, while rationalist, were denying the idealistic part of the universe.|$|R
60|$|His harsh tone made both Dick and Sam shiver. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> {{were dealing}} with a {{hardened}} criminal and, most likely, one who would stop at nothing in order to attain his object.|$|R
60|$|But {{the boys}} {{did not turn}} back, and as they went {{steadily}} away <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> were doing their little part in the good work, and making their small sacrifices, like faithful members.|$|R
5|$|Distrusted by {{his colleagues}} {{because of his}} {{tendency}} to change sides and his reputation as an intriguer, Khánh was assigned to I Corps in the far north of the country after Diệm's overthrow to keep {{him away from the}} capital Saigon. Khánh, who had played a minor role in Diệm's overthrow, joined forces with Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Đỗ Mậu, the latter being the director of military security under Diệm and an effective strategist.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> may do so again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
60|$|The young hunters {{were more}} alarmed than ever. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> must be miles from camp. Night was now upon them, and the storm, instead of {{clearing}} away, was growing worse every minute.|$|R
30|$|In only 9 of 151 reports did {{students}} report {{difficulties in}} coordinating meetings. When students reported difficulty, {{it was generally}} because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> were busy and struggled to fit meeting in their schedules.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{relaxation}} of censorship under glasnost made {{the middle class}} even more aware of their Western counterparts. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> deserved fashionable clothing as a status symbol, but still could not easily obtain it.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the large gay populations in port cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has been}} known to allow his {{collaborative}} partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him; Kyle MacLachlan has several times persuaded Lynch to rewrite scenes, including in 1986's Blue Velvet and the television series Twin Peaks, as he <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were not right for his characters. The following lists include all of the cast and crew members with whom Lynch has worked on three or more separate projects.|$|E
5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which {{they were required to}} give to the federal government. Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until {{after the end of the}} war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the match, Saint-Étienne's {{players were}} crying, because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> had been unlucky, but their {{supporters}} were congratulating them, and their return in France was heroic, even though they were defeated.|$|R
60|$|Neither of {{the boys}} slept much and both were up almost as early as anybody on the train. More {{to pass the time}} than because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> hungry, <b>they</b> went into the dining car for breakfast.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a feeling}} of misery over all the house. The {{children}} breathed the air that was poisoned, and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> dreary. <b>They</b> were rather disconsolate, {{did not know what}} to do, what to play at.|$|R
5|$|Protesters were {{described}} by reporters as more confident and even celebratory as they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were nearing their objective—the end of Mubarak's regime—although {{they had no}} tangible evidence of this. An eyewitness told Al Jazeera that {{people of all ages}} and both genders were present. Demonstrators violated the curfew and no one attempted to stop them. Looting was also reported, while no police were visible.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{continuation}} of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing {{a small number of}} shows in Europe with bassist Dennis Curlee. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees {{needed a}} top-tier {{starting}} pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> {{could afford to}} part with Pineda because of their depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.|$|E
50|$|All main {{characters}} of these novels have rarely traveled {{outside of their}} region, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that where <b>they</b> live is where they belong.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> must {{be close}} to the enemy's picket line, and paused to {{consider}} the situation. Before them was a gentle slope, terminating at a small but deep stream which flowed into the Rio Grande River.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the retreat}} of the Spaniards the {{delight in the}} city was immense; they had met the pikemen of Spain and hurled them back discomfited, and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> could now trust {{themselves}} to meet further assaults without flinching.|$|R
5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were trying to write for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E
5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters. The conspirators <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> needed the support of a field marshal on active duty, and gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
