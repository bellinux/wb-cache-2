5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{shooting}} format affects {{how easy it}} would be to achieve a deep focus look. This is because the size of the sensor or film gauge dictates what particular lens focal length would be used in order to achieve a desired viewing angle. Smaller sensors or film gauges will require an overall range of shorter focal lengths to achieve any desired viewing angle than larger sensors or film gauges. Because depth of field is a characteristic of lens focal length (in addition to aperture and focus <b>distance</b> <b>setting),</b> it is easier to achieve a deep-focus look with a smaller imaging sensor or film gauge. For example: a 40mm lens will give a 30-degree horizontal angle of view in the Super35 format. To achieve the same viewing angle with a 1/2" [...] 16:9 sensor, you would need a 13mm lens. A 13mm lens inherently has much more depth-of-field than a 40mm lens. To achieve the same depth of field with a 40mm lens would require a very small aperture, which in turn would require far more light, and therefore time and expense.|$|E

As the physical distances between leaders and followers widens, more emphasis {{will need to be}} placed on applying traditional benchmark leadership approaches and theories to this context. The study explores and highlights the following issues connected to distance management: How is the full range leadership model, including transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles between the leader and followers affected when applied in a <b>distance</b> <b>setting?</b> How effective is the use of different information and communication technology mediums in closing the gap created through physical distance as a mediating factor between a leader and a follower in many situations? The researchers have concluded that distance has a profound effect on a leader’s ability to display the characteristics of transformational leadership. Passive avoidant styles also tend to manifest themselves more strongly in a <b>distance</b> <b>setting</b> than an office setting with daily contact. The transactional leadership characteristics of contingent reward and management by exception (active) seem to be more dependent on individual leadership style and {{do not seem to be}} as affected by distance as a primary influencing variable. The effects of the frequency of the use of information and communication technology on the distance sample was also examined in relationship to its affect on perception of leadership by individuals being managed in a <b>distance</b> <b>setting.</b> The affects from the use of more simpler forms of ICT are negligible. Richer forms of ICT medium (video conferencing and tele-links etc.) could be necessary to attempt to lessen this gap between leader perceptions in closer vs. distance settings. For those respondents already being managed at a distance, there seems to be only a medium level of correlation between the amount of contact that each of the respondents have had with their supervisor through mail or phone and their perceptions of the leader. This medium correlation is positive for both transformational and transactional leadership characteristics. When it comes to the passive avoidant characteristics the correlation is a medium negative one- as the amount of contact with the supervisor increases the perception that the supervisor employs these characteristics decreases. As companies spread out across the globe, more attention will need to be paid to distance as a moderating factor. The skills of transformational leadership will have to be assessed in more detail to find out how these leadership characteristics can still be both developed and applied so that they transfer over in a <b>distance</b> <b>setting.</b> Only then can the gap of distance be bridged, with technology most likely to play a key role in making this possible...|$|E

Thin wire electrode with round section does not have enough cross sectional area under the high wire tension condition. Therefore, a wire electrode with track- shaped section was proposed and applied to the wire EDM slicing of silicon carbide ingot.

The isolated context and the physical absence of tutor and peers suggest that FL anxiety might be intensified in a <b>distance</b> <b>setting.</b> A longitudinal study using questionnaires, think-aloud protocols and one-to-one telephone interviews with students enrolled on a distance lower-intermediate French course at The Open University (UK) set out to test this hypothesis and to explore the nature of language anxiety in a distance learning environment and the strategies students use to cope with it. The findings indicated that although there were areas in which distance language learners shared aspects of anxiety with face-to-face learners, the distance factor could be causally linked to some marked differences with regard to the nature and extent of language anxiety. Moreover, there was evidence that the distance language learning setting may be associated with absence of anxiety for some learners, a finding that merits further investigation. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
