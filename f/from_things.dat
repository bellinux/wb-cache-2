5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income <b>from</b> <b>things</b> such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|An added {{difficulty}} for Killigrew {{and his sons}} Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678–1684 with the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Bill crisis distracting potential audiences <b>from</b> <b>things</b> theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, {{but most of all}} the King's which had no profit margin to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by Thomas Betterton, the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in Dorset Garden closed for a time. In 1688 Betterton was removed from managerial control by Alexander Davenant, son of William Davenant, the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the Canary Islands in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer Christopher Rich for the next 16 years.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and <b>from</b> <b>things</b> during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E

25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori.

Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies find it easier to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle. Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography.|$|E

Yuma senses though that there might be trouble between her and Fujiwara despite Hotaru's strong attitude. She later takes a job at a shady cat maid café which alarms Yuma which makes her join as well. Hotaru eventually gets surprised by Yuma's bolder moves which makes her happy yet for some reason also in pain.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned <b>from</b> <b>things</b> in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

500|$|Einar Jolin {{was born}} 7August 1890 in Stockholm. He {{was the son}} of {{professor}} Severin Jolin and grandson of actor Johan Christopher Jolin. He grew up on Kammakargatan 45 in the Jolinska Huset (Jolin Residence), a three-story townhouse with a garden, built by his grandfather. Jolin grew {{up in the middle of}} Stockholm close to Tegnérlunden, Adolf Fredrik Church and Vasaparken, which may have influenced his depiction of houses, roof tops, and views of Stockholm in his paintings. Jolin loved his house with its exotic furnishings. For interior paintings, he often selected props <b>from</b> <b>things</b> in the house [...] Gustavian and Empire style furniture, Chinese embroideries and East Indian tableware. Other residents in the house were his parents, brother Eric, sisters Ingrid and Signe, grandmother Mathilde Wigert-Jolin and his aunt, artist Ellen Jolin (1854–1939) who was the first to teach Jolin the basic techniques of painting.|$|E
500|$|In Aesthetic Realism {{classes and}} lessons, Koppelman learned that ethical {{problems}} are also artistic problems. [...] He felt his work {{suffered from a}} fight between rigidity and flexibility. He learned he could go after precision in the studio as penance for being careless at other times, wanting to get away <b>from</b> <b>things.</b> [...] As freedom and order, truth and imagination became more integrated in his life, his art became more imaginative. “I had always had a classical bent in my work,” he wrote. “But {{there was also a}} wildness in me that had not come into my work sufficiently or gracefully.” As a result of his study, Koppelman noted, “Tightness and abandon, the classical and the wild, even the conservative and the rebel seemed to be working better together” resulting in art that was “more imaginative, freer in concept” [...] Boldness of imagination and an unerring sense of detail were two qualities Koppelman’s work became noted for.|$|E
