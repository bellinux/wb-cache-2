40|$|In the {{wireless}} sensor network, the WLAN interference, multi-path fading andattenuation {{are the main}} reason for packets’ corruption. Forward errorcorrection is one of the methods for error mitigation. Many coding methods aredesigned to improve the reliability of wireless channel. However, none of thesecoding methods could handle the burst errors that widely exist in wirelesschannel and are mainly responsible for packet corruption. <b>Interleaving</b> isintroduced to robust these coding methods and make those corrupted packetsavailable to be corrected by spreading the burst errors. The Reed-Solomon(15, 7) block code is used as the forwarding error correction in theseexperiments. In this paper, seven different symbol <b>interleaving</b> will be firstlysimulated in the Matlab platform under four different channels to evaluate theirpacket error rate performances. Then, two of the seven <b>interleaving</b> with betterperformance and the simplest <b>interleaving</b> algorithm, general block interleavingwill be implemented in the TinyOS platform, and they will be compared witheach other from packet error rate, <b>interleaving</b> time and memory consumptionaspects.

The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit.

5|$|Two more combat {{versions}} of the PanzerI were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers {{to have a real}} impact on the progress of the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf.A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf.C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk-style <b>interleaved</b> roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30millimeters (1.18in), over twice that of either the Ausf.A or B, and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon, with a 50-round drum, firing 7.92mm anti-tank shells. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes.

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. <b>Interleaved,</b> there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} a novel <b>interleaving</b> technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), namely adaptive <b>interleaving,</b> which can break the bursty channel errors {{more effectively than}} traditional block <b>interleaving.</b> The technique rearranges the symbols according to instantaneous channel state information of the OFDM subcarriers so as to reduce or minimize the bit error rate (BER) of each OFDM frame. It is well suited to OFDM systems because the channel state information (CSI) values of the whole frame could be estimated at once when transmitted symbols are framed in the frequency dimension. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme can greatly improve {{the performance of the}} coded modulation systems utilizing block <b>interleaving.</b> Furthermore, we show that the adaptive <b>interleaving</b> out performs any other static <b>interleaving</b> schemes, even in the fast fading channel (with independent fading between symbols).
