30|$|From a European policy perspective, the {{situation}} regarding metal ores {{can be regarded}} as most critical, as Europe has only a minor production of metals within its territory and is thus heavily dependent on imports from other world regions. In 2011, only 13  % of all metals required as direct and indirect inputs for products and services finally consumed in the <b>EU</b> <b>stemmed</b> from within the European territory. Again, the Asia and Pacific region plays the most important role as a raw material provider (50  %). Most important extraction countries are China, which accounts for 27  % of total EU metal footprint, mostly in the categories of iron ore and copper. Australia delivered 6  % of metals serving as indirect inputs to EU final demand, with iron ore, copper and precious metals being the most important commodities. Three percent of the metal footprint originated in Indonesia, dominated by lead and zinc. Thirty-two percentage of metals embodied in EU’s final demand were extracted in the Americas, with Latin American countries providing almost three quarters, mostly iron ore, copper, lead, zinc and precious metals.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{following}} {{paper is to}} describe and analyze the contemporary development in Northeast Asia (NEA) region, {{from the point of}} view of the European Unions policy perspective.

40|$|Introduction] A {{few months}} after the French and Dutch {{electorate}} rejected the constitutional treaty, it is time to analyze the results of the June referenda and reflect on what they teach us about the EU’s legitimacy predicament. We must first disentangle what the “no” voters wanted to reject: their own government, “Europe” as they saw it, enlargement —since the phobia of the outside ran deep, well beyond the now proverbial fear of the Polish plumber. There were many “nos” and the French and Dutch outcomes need not stem from the same political dynamic. An understanding of the social bases of the vote is thus also in order. Paul Taggart provides such an analysis. Yves Mény and Jos de Beus then discuss in more detail the significance of the French and Dutch campaigns and electoral results both for the countries themselves and for European integration. George Ross concludes our Forum by arguing that the actual crisis in the <b>EU</b> <b>stems</b> from the anxieties about the European “social model” and notes the political difficulties that France and Germany, the EU tandem of yesteryear, face when it comes to reforming. Without growth and jobs, can there be a legitimacy for the European project? Without national reforms (EU-induced or otherwise), how do EU economies improve? This is the current double-bind...|$|R
40|$|The {{economics}} of language applied to multilingualism in the European Union (EU) {{has only recently}} come to the fore. Languages economics and Law and Economics disciplines both emerged in the 1960 s. However, no study has, hitherto, linked these disciplines. This paper intends to fill that void. Language barriers are the last major remaining barriers for the EU’s ‘single’ market. The lack of coor- dination of multilingualism in the <b>EU</b> <b>stems</b> from a taboo crystallized by a dilemma between economic efficiency and linguistic diversity—i. e., the maximization of wealth versus the maximization of utility. The EU Member States (MSs) do not hasten to coordinate their language policies at the EU level inasmuch as they overestimate {{the benefits of the}} current EU multilingualism while drastically underestimating its costs. Coordination shall occur when MSs evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} the current EU multilingualism. This will uncover the aforementioned dilemma, that will only be resolved when both Law and Economics are applied. In pursuing this objective a ‘‘Linguistic Coase Theorem’’ adapted from the work of Parisi and the Nobel Prize winner, Ronald Coase is elaborated. Having outlined the basic notions deriving from the EU Law of Languages and the Economics of Languages (Introduction), the paper scrutinizes the costs and benefits incurred by the current non-coordinated EU multilingualism (Part I). Subsequently, a ‘Linguistic Coase Theorem’ is elaborated in order to reach a Pareto-optimal out- come, thereby solving the dilemma—both economic efficiency and the linguistic diversity being enhanced (Part II) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors conduct a {{meta-analysis}} {{to examine the}} link between R&D spending and {{economic growth in the}} EU and other regions. The results suggest that the growth-enhancing effect of R&D in the EU 15 countries does not differ from that in other countries in general, but it is less significant than that for other industrialized countries. A closer inspection of the data reveals that the weak results for the <b>EU</b> 15 <b>stem</b> from comparisons with the US - the US has been able to generate a stronger growth response from its R&D spending. Possible explanations for the US advantage include higher private sector investment in R&D and stronger public-private sector linkages than in the EU. Hence, to reduce the "innovation gap" vis- 0 -vis the US, it may not be enough for the EU to raise the share of R&D expenditures in GDP: continuous improvements in the European innovation system will also be needed, with focus on areas like private sector R&D and public-private sector linkages...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{has suggested that}} nation-states will gradually fade away in favor of regions and super-regions as the main actors within a European Union characterized by strong regional identities. At the same time, recent developments have shown that citizen support for European integration is essential for any future development of the Union.

This paper empirically tests this suggestion, while shedding light on the relationship between the quality of representation of regional interests at the EU level and positive citizen attitudes towards the EU. In particular, it finds two explanations for cross-regional variation in the relationship between Euroskepticism and representation: (1) a cultural explanation, embodied by a difference in the nature and quality of representation between regions that are linguistically distinctive and regions that are not; and (2) an institutional explanation, embodied by a difference in the nature and quality of representation between region...|$|R

40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} {{as a part}} of European integration {{has been}} on the Ukrainian agenda for years and resulted in the finalized Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreement with the EU, though yet to be signed. This thesis aims to contribute to the previous assessments by approaching the issue of institutional alignment of Ukraine to the <b>EU’s</b> acquis <b>stemming</b> from the “deep” aspect of the DCFTA. The “small shares” problem inherent in previous applications of the Computable General Equilibrium model to study Ukraine-EU trade liberalization is addressed here by estimating potential Ukrainian exports of currently negligibly traded meat and dairy products with the EU. This is done by applying the Sharp Regression Discontinuity design to estimate the treatment effects from a representative adjustment experienced by the New Member States of the EU. The findings reveal a significant positive discontinuity of exports for new EU members for all meat and dairy product categories with particularly large increase of bovine products’ exports. Final calculations demonstrate the most pronounced potential growth of Ukrainian exports to the EU to accrue for animal products as well as milk and dairy produce, up to 149 and 33 million Euros respectively...|$|R
40|$|Examining Board: Prof. Donatella della Porta (EUI/External Supervisor); Prof. Laszlo Bruszt, EUI; Prof. Sidney Tarrow, Cornell University; Prof. Carlo Ruzza, University of LeicesterDefence date: 9 January 2009 This {{doctoral}} thesis aims {{to trace the}} impacts of campaigns carried out by coalitions of social movement organisations in the transnational arena of the EU. In order to accomplish this task, an original approach to process tracing is adopted using methods used in social movement studies. The internal aspects of campaigns are investigated using a dynamic, cross-time and multi-level, frame analysis, while the contexts of the campaigns are analysed through political and discursive opportunity approaches adapted to the peculiarities of the EU arena. Four case studies, including two campaigns concerned with environmental / public health policy (GMOs and coexistence, and the REACH legislation) and two concerned with broadly defined social policy (the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda and the Services directive), make up the empirical part of the study. Drawing on documentary evidence as well as semi-structured interviews with staff members from the core SMOs involved in each campaign at the Brussels level, the processes leading to access, agenda, or policy outcomes (or indeed non-outcomes) are traced using the analytical methods mentioned above. These processes {{provide the basis for}} preliminary conclusions on the nature of campaigning in the EU. Elite allies are found to be important in securing desired outcomes in campaigns, as are solid, previously agreed shared frames between coalition organisations. The cases also show that the EU is not an arena where conventional tactics (i. e. lobbying) are always enough – indeed the ability to campaign effectively at multiple levels using appropriate tactics is identified as a major factor in campaigns that saw positive outcomes. This finding challenges the idea that the EU arena is unsuitable to protest actions (e. g. Marks and McAdam 1996). Finally, the study uncovers the beginnings of a divide between ‘technical’ and ‘political’ campaigns in the <b>EU.</b> <b>Stemming</b> from the finding that national contexts still provided the opportunities or threats that appeared most important in campaign outcomes, the cases showed that where campaigns were more ‘political’ - in that they were more ideologically charged - groups {{were more likely to be}} able to mobilise grassroots members and secure their desired outcomes. In more ‘technical’ cases, where the European Commission played a greater role, mobilisation efforts were subdued as groups sunk their resources in long cycles of consultation and knowledge production geared to the needs of the Commission...|$|R

40|$|While the usual, more {{established}} ways of tackling prostitution {{focus on the}} prostitutes themselves, i. e. those offering services, the newer (Swedish) approach advocates the criminalisation of those who represent the demand side of prostitution, i. e. the clients. This approach, which has recently been followed or contemplated on by some other <b>EU</b> countries, <b>stems</b> from the belief that prostitution is per sea violent phenomenon; that it is, more concretely, a form of violence against women, {{which is why it}} needs to be fought against and extinguished. The first part of the article demonstrates the basic elements of the main arguments of the proponents of criminalisation and suggests some counterarguments, targeting the claim that voluntary prostitution equals violence. The idea that criminal law or criminalisation is the best solution for tackling undesirable social reality is then challenged and certain negative characteristics of such regulation exposed. Lastly, some other criminological considerations that militate against such a prohibitionist approach are discussed. Through the use of existing research, examples and deconstruction of the discourse of the proponents of criminalisation, the article indicates that the conception of prostitution as violence is misleading and legally-philosophically untenable, while the proposed solution to the "prostitution problem", i. e. the criminalisation of clients of prostitutes, problematic in a criminological as well as wider societal sense...|$|R

We also examine the rationale for public intervention in the innovation process in two contrasting theoretical contexts, the neoclassical and the neo-Schumpeterian.

40|$|The {{first two}} {{sections}} {{of this article}} consider the two pillars on {{which most of the}} claims for the foundations of EC governments are based, namely that it has established a sovereign system of law and new forms of governance structures. I argue that {{for a variety of reasons}} neither of these can explain how EU government actualizes itself. For this, I argue in the third section, one must look to the techniques of problem-solving that the EC has adopted. These not only structure the style of EC policy-making but decenter power far more radically than the multi-level governance literature would suggest. This leads to a corresponding centering of social relations, with the center of gravity of much of EU government being vested in two forms of social institution, the locale and those organisations that institutionalise expertise. The fourth section examines the manner in which this feature is exacerbated by the resources available to the EU institutions to affect change. Legal instruments are the central resource available to the EU institutions, but a quality of this resource that differentiates it from other forms is that it transforms government into a dialectical, mutually constitutive process. In the fifth section I argue that much of the crisis of confidence in <b>EU</b> government <b>stems</b> from the style of problem-solving that it has adopted, which creates a fissure between interests and identities. I then examine how EU government could possibly ‘legitimise’ itself through being more receptive to the politics of identity...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{has been}} prizing itself {{for being the}} global leader in terms of climate change; its {{triptych}} approach and the 20 - 20 - 20 targets were certainly an enviable effort prior to the United Nations Convention. However, with the economic crisis having left its mark, {{there has been a}} decrease in ambitiousness and the paradigm is now dominated by competitiveness. The 2014 energy and climate package and its 2030 targets were therefore not only comparably unambitious but also nonbinding, with only GHG emission reduction being set. With the eastern countries traditionally being not very fond of climate policies, the thesis especially concentrates on where Poland and its coal-based energy system have stood as things developed and therefore assesses the role the country and the broader Visegrad Group had. Asking questions that get at the underlying reasons, the liberal intergovernmental framework is chosen to analyze how domestic preference building in Poland takes place, finding that the conventional energy sector has a tremendous impact on policy making. While Poland absorbed the directives to fit them into existing practices, without causing substantial structural changes, it applied a much more aggressive approach in the run up to the 2030 process, sending clear signals and thereby significantly contributing to the lowered ambitiousness of <b>EU</b> policies. <b>Stemming</b> not exclusively from a turn in the international environment, the learning process of the eastern Member States in the post-accession period played a decisive role in this development...|$|R
40|$|September 2016 {{marks the}} passing of one year has passed since the {{outbreak}} of the EU migration crisis which became the basis of unprecedented co-operation between Turkey and the EU. Paradoxically, although this co-operation in containing the crisis has proven surprisingly effective, the climate of Turkish-EU relations has significantly deteriorated. This situation comes in part as a result of internal tensions in Turkey (and within the EU). However, genuine changes in the power relations between Turkey and the EU have occurred and Turkey feels that issues it attaches importance to are not being appropriately addressed by the EU—the frustration this causes has been even more instrumental in the deterioration of relations. This shift in relations between Turkey and the <b>EU</b> also <b>stems</b> from Turkey’s aspirations to emancipate itself in its relations with the West; there has been an upward trend in this regard for years. The instruments the EU has so far been employing in order to put Turkey under pressure (above all the EU integration process) are losing their effectiveness, which is in stark contrast with Turkey’s emancipation and assertiveness. However, irrespective of the present and future inevitable tensions in Turkish-EU relations, Turkey’s aim is not to break off with the EU but to develop a new model of strategic relations which better serves its own interests.

Industry-level analysis indicates that producers of apparel, tobacco, and transportation equipment were particularly affected by the threat of retaliatory tariffs.

While research exploring this phenomenon in universities has produced several important works, fewer studies have examined partnerships centered on the community college. Instead, the bulk of articles written about community college partnerships merely serve as how-to guides for college leaders, providing the benefits of and lessons learned from specific partnerships between colleges and industry (Erwin, 2005; Sundberg, 2002). The purpose of this case study is to provide an in-depth, critical analysis of a complex partnership involving many organizations in a unique geographic setting. The study focuses on the community college {{at the center of a}} regional <b>STEM</b> education <b>coalition,</b> exploring why the college entered into the partnership and how it was affected. Findings demonstrate that several factors at the state and national level, or "streams," combined to form a powerful "current" of influence uniquely tailored to the community in which the college was located. Further, the loose and informal structure of the coalition, coupled with a myopic and hegemonic institutional narrative, allowed individuals outside the college to guide and direct the activities of the institution with relatively little dissent. Because of the lack of orchestrated inter-organizational coordination and agreement, the objective of the coalition, to develop a pipeline of STEM education programs from high school through the university, suffered from challenges and breakdowns at every level. The study concludes by discussing implications for college leaders regarding building relationships with external organizations, effectively serving the local citizenry, and responding to constituents and incentives of various kinds...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. This {{examination}} {{of the state of}} transatlantic relations argues that the positions of the EU Member States and the U. S. are in fact more nuanced. Two concerns are highlighted. The first is that the European resistance to military intervention in Iraq is not only a result of collective military weakness which, ipso facto, leads to a preference for a non-military resolution. The positions of any <b>EU</b> Member States <b>stems</b> from profound concern about what military intervention might trigger in the mid to longer term, both in Iraq as well as the region generally. The second concern is that the push for military intervention by the Bush administration, possibly without substantial international support, will compromise the chances for long-term stability in the region. The decisive advantage of the U. S., the hyperpuissance, over its European allies is its overwhelming military superiority. This alone cannot guarantee peace and stability for the region. That can only be done through multilateral efforts which the U. S. is not necessarily the best equipped to lead...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} before their {{accession}} to the European Union (EU) the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe {{were expected to}} reform their economic and social policies to satisfy EU-wide requirements and to become competitive in a market-orientated system. The countries were subject to pressure in the accession negotiations and eligible for aid to help them adapt. This thesis examines the influences that the EU brought to bear {{in the field of}} vocational education and training (VET) and investigates why the EU made the requirements that it did. The thesis adopts a historical methodology, tracing the previous evolution of EU policy on VET on the one hand, and the state of VET under communism in eastern Europe on the other. It then examines the factors impinging on VET caused by the pressures of economic transition and the accession process. The treatment of VET during the accession negotiations and in the programme of aid are investigated in detail. Interviews with a number of key participants in the process shed light on the assumptions and reactions of the main stakeholders. The thesis shows how the <b>EU’s</b> interventions <b>stemmed</b> largely from its internal policies on VET rather than from a diagnosis of the problems of individual eastern countries. The EU increasingly applied to the East the emphasis on lifelong learning and the methods of negotiated target-setting that it had evolved to make an impact with existing member states. Various common European instruments for VET which emerged after 2002 also impinged on the East, though they had been presaged by a distinctive approach to curriculum design which featured in aid projects in the East. At the level of specific policy areas, the thesis findings tend to support a neo-functionalist interpretation of what drives integration within the EU...|$|R

In terms of widening, the EU completed its largest ever enlargement when 10 states joined the EU on May 1 st 2004, {{and in terms of}} deepening, the EU member states completed the negotiations process and signed the Constitutional Treaty on October 29, 2004. However, the EU faced its largest legitimacy crisis immediately after these two ground breaking developments with the French and Dutch No votes on the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty and with the European public complaining about the ill effects of enlargement. Thus, the European integration process has reached an impasse, which revolves around the European governments’ making decisions without consulting or taking into account the public’s views on these matters.

The article concludes that the role of WTO law in the Estonian legal system has changed considerably since 2004. Today, WTO law should be viewed in Estonia first and foremost as part of <b>EU</b> law. Constraints <b>stemming</b> from <b>EU</b> law have {{to be taken into account}} when resorting to WTO law in domestic courts. As a result, the extent to which WTO law can be referred to in Estonian courts has decreased. Although WTO law is generally not directly applicable in domestic courts, there are nevertheless certain ways in which it can be relied on. The Estonian Supreme Court has in several cases made reference to WTO law with the aim of interpreting ambiguous national provisions. This practice is to be welcomed. In conclusion, the article suggests that in order for Estonia to be able to successfully navigate in the globalizing marketplace, it is desirable to ensure that the overall awareness of WTO law continues to increase...|$|R
40|$|Differentiated {{integration}} {{in the area of}} EU industrial policy is the result of one or more of five factors: differences in ideology among Member States, domestic political circumstances, capacity (level of economic development), national economic structures, and technical preferences. There is a considerable degree of ‘capitalist diversity’ in the EU (Wilks, 1996). Even among the ‘Original Six’ Member States there are important differences in approach to economic regulation, even if they all embrace the EU system (Gerber, 2000). Ideological difference may contribute to differentiation in that Member States where economic liberalism holds more sway in government circles will pursue different policies than those pursued by Member States where interventionist solutions to industrial problems are more acceptable. Different levels of economic development have repeatedly been used as a justification for temporary derogations for poorer Member States in the implementation of <b>EU</b> legislation. Justifications <b>stemming</b> from ideology, economic development and structures can result in differentiated participation in EU-led or other European R&D projects. Technical preference has been a cited reason for delays in certain national programmes of sector-based market liberalisation. In several areas these five factors overlap, and assessing their relative importance is difficult. Differentiated {{integration in}} industrial policy areas is largely ‘soft’ and unofficial and comes in three forms: varying national participation in EU and other European projects; the discretion permitted in the implementation of EU legislation; and varying levels of compliance with EU legislation. Legally entrenched, multi-speed differentiation is present principally in terms of temporary derogation on a limited range of EU legislation. The explicit legal sanction of more permanent differentiation in industrial policy areas is rare. This chapter presents one recent legislative development that effectively entrenches differentiation in energy markets and potentially undermines market integration in this sector...|$|R
30|$|In {{the context}} of the {{transformation}} toward a “green economy,” issues related to natural resource use have rapidly increased in importance in European and international policy debates. The large number of studies applying economy-wide material flow analysis so far mostly produced aggregated national indicators, making the results difficult to connect to policies, which are often designed for single sectors or consumption areas. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the composition of EU’s material footprint in its global context, aiming at identifying the main product groups contributing to overall material consumption and specifying the geographical sources for the raw materials required to satisfy EU’s final demand. Based on multi-regional input–output (MRIO) modeling, we apply production layer decomposition to assess supply chains and their structural changes from 1995 to 2011. The global MRIO database used in this study is EXIOBASE 3, which disaggregates 200 products and 163 industries, of which 33 represent material extraction sectors. By that means, we increase the level of detail to a degree where policies can more easily connect to. We find that the generally growing material footprint of the EU was characterized by a dramatic shift regarding the origin of raw materials, with the share of materials extracted within the EU territory falling from 68  % in 1995 to 35  % in 2011. In 2011, raw materials extracted in China to produce exports to the EU already contributed an equal share to EU’s material footprint as material extraction within the EU itself. Import dependency is most critical for the material group of metal ores, with only 13  % of all metals required as inputs to <b>EU</b> final demand <b>stemming</b> from within the EU. Regarding product composition, construction was confirmed as the most important sector contributing to the material footprint, followed by the group of manufacturing products based on biomass. Materials embodied in service sector activities together contributed a quarter to the total material footprint in 2011, making services an important, but currently disregarded area for European resource policies. We also find that supply chain structures became more complex over time, with a growing part located outside the EU territory.|$|R
