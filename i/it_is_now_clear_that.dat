5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the common}} {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later {{evolved into a}} swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between {{the second and third}} funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E

25|$|In Capitalism and Slavery, Eric Williams {{argued that}} the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the {{abolition}} of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

25|$|Bilateral {{oophorectomy}} {{has been}} traditionally {{done in the}} belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.|$|E
25|$|Cook did {{not lose}} a single man to scurvy, and his report came down in favour of malt and wort, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the reason for the}} health of his crews on this and other voyages was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food and green stuffs. Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was {{in the beginning of}} 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{after the}} war, Brand commented: [...] "I {{made a terrible}} mistake in passing this on to the British. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to me that Himmler sought to sow {{suspicion}} among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow." ...|$|R

25|$|Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau {{insisted that}} the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) {{participate}} in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. In the past, {{the reasons why the}} Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 {{have been the subject of}} speculation. But since the release of relevant Soviet archives, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements. The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U.S. were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{recognition}} of E. cinnabarina as a species, E. lewisii was interpreted {{to be the}} sister of E. cardinalis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> E. cinnabarina and E. cardinalis are sister species and that E. lewisii and E. erubescens are sister species. [...] In the hypothesized phylogeny, the 'cinnabarina/cardinalis' pair is sister to the 'lewisii/erubescens' pair.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{following}} large-scale frog {{deaths in}} Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas {{came up with}} identical results: a previously undescribed species of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> many recent extinctions of amphibians in Australia and the Americas are linked to this fungus. [...] This fungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as chytrids that are not generally pathogenic.|$|E

2500|$|In September, Rawlinson and Bacon became pessimistic and Haig {{postponed}} {{the operation}} again but {{told them to}} be ready for the second week of October. The 42nd Division moved from Ypres, relieved the 66th Division in late September and found that the area was under frequent German artillery-fire, bombing and gas attacks. The coastal sector was also beneath the flight path of German Gotha bombers attacking Dunkirk, which was bombed on twenty-three nights in September. Hopes rose after the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) and again after the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October), although the coastal operation could not start {{before the end of the}} month. After the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October), Hush was cancelled; on 14 October, Rawlinson wrote, [...] "...things have not been running at all smoothly – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> we shall do nothing on the coast here". The 1st Division left the camp at Le Clipon on 21 October and the rest of the Fourth Army followed on 3 November. On 23 April 1918, the Dover Patrol raided Zeebrugge and sank block ships in the canal entrance, to stop U-boats leaving port. The Belgian Army and the British Second Army began the Fifth Battle of Ypres on 28 September 1918 and on 17 October, Ostend was captured.|$|E
40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> thanks both to {{the work}} of anthropologists like Descola and the various {{ecological}} crises, that the notion of nature had the great defect of unifying too quickly the composition of the common world.

2500|$|There is {{currently}} {{an epidemic of}} XDR-TB South Africa. [...] The outbreak was first reported as a cluster of 53 patients in a rural hospital in KwaZulu-Natal of whom 52 died. What was particularly worrying was that the mean survival from sputum specimen collection to death was only 16 days and {{that the majority of}} patients had never previously received treatment for tuberculosis. [...] This is the epidemic for which the acronym XDR-TB was first used, although TB strains that fulfil the current definition have been identified retrospectively, this was the largest group of linked cases ever found. [...] Since the initial report in September 2006, cases have now been reported in most provinces in South Africa. As of 16 March 2007, there were 314 cases reported, with 215 deaths. [...] It is clear that the spread of this strain of TB is closely associated with a high prevalence of HIV and poor infection control; in other countries where XDR-TB strains have arisen, drug-resistance has arisen from mismanagement of cases or poor patient compliance with drug treatment instead of being transmitted from person to person. [...] This strain of TB does not respond to any of the drugs currently available in South Africa for first- or second-line treatment. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the problem has been around for much longer than health department officials have suggested, and is far more extensive. [...] By 23 November 2006, 303 cases of XDR-TB had been reported, of which 263 were in KwaZulu-Natal. [...] Serious thought has been put to isolation procedures that may deny some patients their human rights, but which may be necessary to prevent further spread of this strain of TB.|$|E
