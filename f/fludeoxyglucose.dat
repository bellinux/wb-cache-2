25|$|<b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F) (INN), or <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 (USAN and USP), also {{commonly}} called fluorodeoxyglucose and abbreviated FDG, 18F-FDG or FDG, is a radiopharmaceutical {{used in the}} medical imaging modality positron emission tomography (PET). Chemically, it is 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose, a glucose analog, with the positron-emitting radionuclide fluorine-18 substituted for the normal hydroxyl group at the C-2 position in the glucose molecule.|$|E
25|$|If the biologically active {{molecule}} {{chosen for}} PET is <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> (FDG), an analogue of glucose, {{the concentrations of}} tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of cancer metastasis (i.e., spreading to other sites) {{is the most common}} type of PET scan in standard medical care (90% of current scans). However, although on a minority basis, many other radioactive tracers are used in PET to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest. One of the disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost.|$|E
25|$|The term radioisotope, {{which in}} its general sense refers to any {{radioactive}} isotope (radionuclide), {{has historically been}} {{used to refer to}} all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a radioactive tracer atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a gamma camera or similar gamma imaging device. An example is <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> in which fluorine-18 is incorporated into deoxyglucose. Some radioisotopes (for example gallium-67, gallium-68, and radioiodine) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body.|$|E
25|$|Carbon-11 choline {{has found}} more success in cancer systems imaging. Choline is a {{precursor}} for {{the synthesis of}} phospholipids in our cells. When a cell is about to divide, it synthesizes these phospholipids to generate enough material to build the cell membranes of the two daughter cells. Thus {{it was hypothesized that}} highly proliferative tumors would uptake more choline than the surrounding healthy tissue. This was first tested in brain tumors after successful demonstration of choline uptake in the brain. It was found that these brain tumors had over 10x the uptake of carbon-11 choline than the surrounding brain tissue. Furthermore, because of the low choline uptake in healthy brain tissue, carbon-11 choline was found to be a superior PET tracer than fluorine-18 <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (FDG) when delineating brain tumors. Carbon-11 choline has also been used to detect tumors in the colon and esophagus and lung metastases.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} also used for {{diagnostic}} purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera {{can be used to}} form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via bone scan).|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} imaging {{involves the}} administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer. The {{most commonly used}} tracers are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, gallium-67, indium-111, thallium-201 and <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F) (18F-FDG). The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, brain, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiological function. The excretory function of the kidneys, iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid, blood flow to heart muscle, etc. can be measured. The principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the PET Scanner, which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer {{in the body and}} display it as an image. With computer processing, the information can be displayed as axial, coronal and sagittal images (single-photon emission computed tomography - SPECT or Positron-emission tomography - PET). In the most modern devices, nuclear medicine images can be fused with a CT scan taken quasisimultaneously, so the physiological information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) measures emissions from radioactively labeled metabolically active chemicals {{that have been}} injected into the bloodstream. The emission data are computer-processed to produce 2- or 3-dimensional images {{of the distribution of}} the chemicals throughout the brain. The positron emitting radioisotopes used are produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labeled with these radioactive atoms. The labeled compound, called a radiotracer, is injected into the bloodstream and eventually makes its way to the brain. [...] Sensors in the PET scanner detect the radioactivity as the compound accumulates in various regions of the brain. [...] A computer uses the data gathered by the sensors to create multicolored 2- or 3-dimensional images that show where the compound acts in the brain.

2500|$|Radionuclides used in PET {{scanning}} {{are typically}} isotopes with short half-lives [...] such as carbon-11 (~20 min), nitrogen-13 (~10 min), oxygen-15 (~2 min), fluorine-18 (~110 min), gallium-68 (~67 min), zirconium-89 (~78.41 hours), or rubidium-82(~1.27 min). These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally {{used by the}} body such as glucose (or glucose analogues), water, or ammonia, [...] or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as radiotracers. [...] PET technology {{can be used to}} trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), [...] provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. [...] Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present, however, by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is fluorodeoxyglucose (also called FDG or <b>fludeoxyglucose),</b> an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F) (INN), or <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 (USAN and USP), also {{commonly}} called fluorodeoxyglucose and abbreviated 18FFDG, 18F-FDG or FDG, is a radiopharmaceutical {{used in the}} medical imaging modality positron emission tomography (PET).

50|$|Large {{amounts of}} oxygen-18 enriched water {{are used in}} {{positron}} emission tomography centers, for on-site production of 18F-labeled <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> (FDG).|$|E
50|$|In 2013 {{the company}} {{acquired}} IBA Molecular UK and Erigal, {{two of the}} three companies in England that produce the radioactive isotope <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F), which is injected into patients as part of the imaging process. Siemens Healthcare is the only other UK producer.|$|E
50|$|The nuclide 18F is the {{radionuclide}} of fluorine {{with the}} longest half-life, 109.771 minutes, {{allowing it to}} serve commercially as {{an important source of}} positrons. Its major use is for the production of the radiopharmaceutical <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> for positron emission tomography scanning in medicine.|$|E
50|$|PEM uses {{a pair of}} gamma {{radiation}} detectors placed {{above and below the}} breast and mild breast compression to detect coincident gamma rays after administration of the radionuclide fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (<b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F)), as used in whole-body PET studies for the detection of metastatic disease.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that gallium imaging may become an obsolete technique, with indium leukocyte imaging and technetium antigranulocyte antibodies replacing it as a detection mechanism for infections. For detection of tumors, especially lymphomas, gallium imaging is still in use, but may be replaced by <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> PET imaging in the future.|$|E
50|$|For Positron Emission Tomography (PET), <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> (18F) is {{the most}} common radiopharmaceutical, with the {{radioactive}} component usually obtained from a cyclotron. The short half life of Fluorine-18 and many other PET isotopes necessitates rapid production. PET radiopharmaceuticals are now often produced by automated computer controlled systems to reduce complexity and radiation doses to staff.|$|E
50|$|Another new imaging {{biomarker}} involves radiolabeled <b>fludeoxyglucose.</b> Positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) {{can be used}} to measure where in the body cells take up glucose. By tracking glucose, doctors can find sites of inflammation because macrophages there take up glucose at high levels. Tumors also take up a lot of glucose, so the imaging strategy {{can be used to}} monitor them as well. Tracking radiolabeled glucose is a promising technique because it directly measures a step known to be crucial to inflammation and tumor growth.|$|E
50|$|In the past, the gallium scan was {{the gold}} {{standard}} for lymphoma staging, until it was replaced by positron emission tomography using <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> (FDG). Gallium imaging is still used to image inflammation and chronic infections, and it still sometimes locates unsuspected tumors as it is taken up by many kinds of cancer cells in amounts that exceed those of normal tissues. Thus, an increased uptake of gallium-67 may indicate a new or old infection, an inflammatory focus from any cause, or a cancerous tumor.|$|E
50|$|Principle: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images living {{systems by}} {{recording}} high-energy γ-rays emitted {{from within the}} subject. The source of the radiation comes from positron-emitting-bound biological molecules, such as 18F-FDG (<b>fludeoxyglucose),</b> which is injected into the test subject. As the radioisotopes decay, they emit positrons which annihilates with electrons found naturally in the body. This produces 2 γ-rays at ~180° apart, which are picked up by sensors on {{opposite ends of the}} PET machine. This allows individual emission events to be localized within the body, and the data set is reconstructed to produce images.|$|E
50|$|Echocardiography, an {{ultrasound}} {{scan of the}} heart, is able to visualize the heart, its size, shape, and any abnormal motion of the heart walls as they beat that may indicate a myocardial infarction. The flow of blood can be imaged, and contrast dyes may be given to improve image. Other scans using radioactive contrast include SPECT CT-scans using thallium, sestamibi (MIBI scans) or tetrofosmin; or a PET scan using <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> or rubidium-82. These nuclear medicine scans can visualize the perfusion of heart muscle. SPECT may {{also be used to}} determine viability of tissue, and whether areas of ischemia are inducible.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Henoch-Schonlein {{vasculitis}} is {{the most}} common systemic vasculitis in children. Arthritis or arthralgia occurs in 80 % of patients. We believe this to be the first case report to describe the finding of polyarthritis in a <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan in a patient with Henoch-Schonlein vasculitis without clinical signs of arthritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4. 5 -year-old Caucasian boy presented with fever of 4 days' duration followed by debilitating migratory arthralgia and inflammation. He underwent a <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan to exclude a possible malignant cause or to detect any infectious or autoimmune focus of his symptoms. <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> uptake was observed in multiple large joints and in multiple tendons. These findings suggested active polyarthritis and polytendinitis. However, physical and ultrasound evaluations did not show any signs of arthritis in our patient, despite his evident arthralgia. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fludeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography-computed tomography might be able to detect inflammatory activity in painful joints that cannot yet be detected clinically or with ultrasound evaluation in a patient with Henoch-Schonlein vasculitis. Therefore, <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography-computed tomography can be of additional value in the diagnostic workup of patients with an unresolved diagnosis of suspected autoimmune disease, especially in patients with unresolved arthralgia and fever of unknown cause...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivePatients with {{advanced}} esophageal {{squamous cell carcinoma}} receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy to improve survival, but benefits are observed only in those with histologic response. Positron emission tomography with <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 (INN <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> [18 F]) detects accumulation of glucose analog in viable cancer cells. This study investigated the usefulness of positron emission tomography with <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 in assessment of response of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to neoadjuvant treatment to establish new criteria to predict postoperative long-term survival. MethodsFifty patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy 35, chemoradiotherapy 15) underwent positron emission tomography with <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 before surgical resection in evaluation of posttreatment maximum standardized uptake value, residual tumor size (maximum square area of longitudinal axis), histologic response, and postoperative survival. ResultsAfter treatment, uptake was not noted in 21 patients (posttreatment maximum standardized uptake value < 2. 5, negative) but was detected in 29 (≥ 2. 5, positive). Residual tumor size ranged from 0 to 54. 0 mm 2 for negative results and 55. 0 to 676. 0 mm 2 for positive, clearly distinguishing histologic major response from nonresponse. The negative group demonstrated significantly higher 5 -year cause-specific survival (67. 7 %) and lower hematogenous recurrence (4. 8 %) than the 36. 5 % and 37. 0 % values in the positive group, (P <. 0042 and P =. 0083, respectively). Univariate Cox regression analyses identified posttreatment maximum standardized uptake value (cutoff 2. 5) as the only preoperative prognostic factor (P =. 0071). ConclusionPosttreatment positron emission tomography with <b>fludeoxyglucose</b> F 18 reliably predicted histologic response and postoperative survival in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
