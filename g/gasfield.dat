50|$|Reassessment of {{the energy}} {{strategy}} has been ongoing since the strategy was issued in 2003. A Gazprom subsidiary issued a report recommending a change of export strategy for the Russian gas industry. It determined that Russia should decrease exports of natural gas to European markets and concentrate instead on developing new <b>gasfields</b> {{to keep up with}} domestic demand, which was rising faster than was envisioned in the 2003 report and could necessitate the development of new <b>gasfields</b> on the Yamal Peninsula and in other places.|$|R
50|$|The first {{natural gas}} find in Australia was at Roma in 1900 {{as a team}} was {{drilling}} a water well. The first gas pipeline in Australia was 435 km in length and was opened on 17 March 1969 by Bjelke-Petersen. It connected the Roma <b>gasfields</b> to Brisbane for commercial and domestic use, a first for a capital city in Australia.

50|$|In 2014 astronomers from Australia's premier observatory, Siding Spring Observatory, in the {{neighbouring}} town of Coonabarabran highlighted the potential damage being caused by artificial light pollution and flaring. Flaring occurs as a cheap way {{to dispose of}} unwanted gas. It also increases light pollution in the night sky. With the plan of 7 major <b>gasfields</b> in the region, astronomers warned {{of the loss of}} Australia's only optical science research facility and what that would mean for future discoveries. Astronomers are also concerned of the material dispersed from coal seam gas operations will be corrosive to telescope mirrors.|$|R
