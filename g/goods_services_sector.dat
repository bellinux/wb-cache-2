40|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> innovation {{have been discussed}} extensively in the academic literature. The research has been both selective (dealing with specific attributes such as R&D, process innovation, measurement of innovation, and use of information technology) and specific (dealing with specific industries such as banking, insurance, biotechnology, nanotechnology). This paper examines the concept of innovation {{in the context of}} "goods" and "services. " The comparisons made between the two sectors are based on three distinct areas — definition, process, measurement. This paper also presents a conceptual framework showing the interactions among the various variables inherent in some of the distinct areas. Previous papers have highlighted the differences in innovation between <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> What is missing is how the intervening variables invoked in the discussions are themselves related to one another. While this paper reinforces the conclusions reached by other studies with regard to innovation, it specifically highlights on an aggregate scale, the areas in which <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> differ. Future research should take these distinctions into account, not as single items but collectively. It is critical to consider how these innovation variables interact with one another in the context of <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> Perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper is in its presentation of the framework for understanding the innovation process {{as it relates to the}} <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sectors.</b> Innovation, <b>goods</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R

Intrinsic and historical differences between <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sectors</b> indicate that a countrys regulatory infrastructure and environment may be potentially more significant for services. The {{regulatory regime}}s for <b>service</b> <b>sectors</b> in many countries today, however, are underdeveloped or otherwise ineffective, and may actually deter investment and hinder opportunities in trade involving services. These shortcomings may have particular implications for countries in negotiating <b>service</b> <b>sectors</b> in trade agreements, as they may be, or may perceive themselves to be, at a disadvantage as they negotiate subject matters largely defined by and dependent on the efficacy of regulatory structures and systems. As services increase their importance in national economies and international trade, governments and citizens of those countries are less likely to fully realize the benefits of trade liberalizing efforts or economic growth policies. This article explores the differences between <b>goods</b> and <b>service</b> <b>sectors</b> and the practical implications of the differences - thus, why regulatory regimes matter. ...|$|R

40|$|Green economy {{policies}} were endorsed by world {{leaders at the}} 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+ 20) as a strategy for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication. Multiple measurement frameworks have been developed internationally for the green economy or green growth. Among this literature, two major categories of green economy measurement can be identified: (i) indicators that reveal trends of decoupling between economic activity and environmental pressures and (ii) measures of the portion of economic activity with a purpose of reducing environmental pressures or improving the sustainable management of natural capital. The United Nations standard for environmental-economic accounting, known as SEEA, broadly defines and provides a list of categories for environmental-related activities, and an environmental <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> (EGSS), {{which is based on}} whether there is a purpose to reduce environmental pressures or manage resources sustainably. Applying the SEEA standard to the collections of economic statistics used in national accounts would allow for calculation of a number of relevant indicators for green economy measurement, such as the proportions of environmentally-related employment, income, production, and investment. However, implementation of EGSS and the Classification of Environmental Activities (CEA) requires addressing several practical challenges, particularly related to identifying and maintaining a registry of basic information on environmental <b>goods,</b> <b>services,</b> and the enterprises in the environmental <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> This paper briefly reviews some of the practical challenges for measuring green activity within an economy using the current national accounting standards...|$|R

While weakness in manufacturing has potential to spread to the <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> the more likely scenario is that the two sectors will continue to move in opposite directions during much of 2016. Weak economies in Asia and Europe will continue to promote a high U. S. dollar, limit growth in U.

40|$|The Australian {{dollar is}} {{considered}} a commodity-based currency, with {{the high level of}} primary commodity exports in Australia’s trade balance given as an explanation. Key studies have concluded that Australia’s terms of trade are a primary driver of the real exchange rate based on a comparative advantage trade model. These studies have been undertaken at an aggregate level where changes in the terms of trade have been assumed as a given. Since the Australian economy was deregulated in the early 1980 s, there have been dramatic changes {{in the structure of the}} economy. Australia’s trading activity has grown and now contributes more within the domestic economy. Similarly the structure and contribution of key imports and exports has also evolved. Furthermore the role of the traded <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> balance and the income balance within the Australian current account balance has also changed, with a significant change occurring in 2003 / 04. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly it establishes whether the relationship between the Australian exchange rate and terms of trade has changed in response to changes in the role of the traded <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> within the Australian current account balance. Secondly the paper disaggregates the movements in the terms of trade to establish what role its various components have on the wider relationship between the Australian exchange rate and the terms of trade. The paper concludes that despite substantial changes in the structure and nature of the current account balance and the traded <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> the Australian exchange rate still responds to changes in the terms of trade as if it is still a commodity-based currency and economy.
