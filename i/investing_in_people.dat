5000|$|Development {{concerns}} {{expanding the}} choices people have, to lead lives that they value, {{and improving the}} human condition so that people {{have the chance to}} lead full lives. Thus, human development is about much more than economic growth, which is only a means of enlarging people’s choices. Fundamental to enlarging these choices is building human capabilities —the range of things that people can do or be in life. Capabilities are [...] "the substantive freedoms person enjoys to lead the kind of life have reason to value". Human development disperses the concentration of the distribution of goods and services that underprivileged people need and center its ideas on human decisions. By <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>people,</b> we enable growth and empower people to pursue many different life paths, thus developing human capabilities. The most basic capabilities for human development are: to lead long and healthy lives, to be knowledgeable (i.e., educated), to have access to resources and social services needed for a decent standard of living, {{and to be able to}} participate in the life of the community. Without these, many choices are simply not available, and many opportunities in life remain inaccessible.|$|E

The firm will typically hold a stock for 4-5 years, sometimes as many as 10-15 years. The firm prefers to invest in mega-trends driven by broad societal and demographic trends, including baby boomer demands for healthcare - trends where demand is expected to remain steady for years, or even decades. The firm seeks to invest in companies that have strong management teams, <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>people</b> not assets. They look for companies that have strong growth opportunities, are appropriately financed, have competitive advantages, and are a leader in their field. Baron Capital places a unique focus on the strength of the management teams of the companies they invest in, looking for credible, dependable, trustworthy leadership. In 2011, Baron Capital had approximately $19.5 billion in assets under management. In an effort to thank investors, Baron hosts an annual shareholder meeting which typically features rock acts such as Elton John, the Beach Boys, and Lionel Richie. In 2012, Baron Capital purchased 24 percent of the stock of the Manchester United Football Club that was offered on the New York Stock Exchange by the Glazer family. Baron's investment amounts to a 2.5% ownership interest in the club as only 10% of the team's stock was floated.|$|E

50|$|USAID's {{development}} program in Angola in FY 2007 {{was consistent with}} the country's status as a developing country at a pivotal juncture in its development and reconstruction. In FY 2006, the program budget was $25.5 million and focused on civil society strengthening, improved governance, and democratization; market-oriented economic analysis and economic reform policy; agricultural sector productivity; maternal and child health; HIV/AIDS prevention, education and voluntary counseling; and workforce development. Angola also launched a major program to fight malaria through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). The Governing Justly and Democratically objective strengthens constituencies and institutions required for democratic governance by strengthening civil society organizations and promoting local government decentralization; fostering an independent media, government transparency, accountability, and capability, and improved dialogue between citizens and government; and laying the groundwork for free and fair elections. The <b>Investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>People</b> objective aims to improve maternal and child health and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases by helping communities and institutions to provide necessary health services and to conduct HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The PMI is the largest health program and expands efforts to scale up proven preventive and treatment interventions toward achievement of 85% coverage among vulnerable groups and 50% reduction in morbidity due to malaria. The Economic Growth objective fosters economic policy and financial sector reform; credit access for micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises; and expanded trade and investment.|$|E
5000|$|Margo Russell {{writes that}} {{defining}} remitted moneys as gifts rather than payments enhances freedom and flexibility for the giver. This works in Swaziland because moneys are not {{sent to a}} household but to “a range of individuals in {{urban and rural areas}} to whom, because of specific relationships, various workers feel a particular obligation.” Here ties are not just of affect; they are of mutual obligation reinforced through the passage of gifts. Gifting remittances fits within and strengthens a larger pattern of reciprocity and obligation in Swaziland. Following on the work of these earlier anthropologists working in Africa, Lisa Cliggett uses the phrases [...] "gift remitting" [...] and [...] "remitting the gift" [...] to describe urban to rural gifting among Zambian families, highlighting that these remittances are more irregular, are of lesser amounts, and tend to be material as opposed to monetary. In Zambia, urban migration and remittance strategies serve to uphold ties, thereby reducing insecurity and allowing for return migration, particularly in old age. Unlike the interests of policy makers and scholars interested in remittances for development, Cliggett emphasizes that: [...] "Zambia migrants do not remit large sums of cash or goods, and that the fundamental concern for migrants in Zambia is <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>people</b> and relationships through remitting, rather than investing in development, improved living conditions or other capital in rural sending communities." ...|$|E

We compared initiatives {{that focused on}} the improvement of place with initiatives that mainly <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> <b>people.</b> Method: A quasi-experimental design compared the trend in good perceived general health in the target districts with comparison districts. Generalized general mixed models assessed the rate of change in prevalence of good health per half year during a prolonged period before and after the start of the interventions. Results: Neither the target districts that <b>invested</b> mainly <b>in</b> place nor the ones with interventions focused on <b>people</b> showed trends <b>in</b> general health different than comparison districts (p > 0. 05). However, only districts with interventions focused on place showed no deterioration in general health during the intervention period.
