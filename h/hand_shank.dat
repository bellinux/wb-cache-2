40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the function of}} the microprobe dredging technology in the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD) and to provide fast, efficient, economical and practical method of treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD). METHODS:The 100 μm diameter stainless steel wire was made as the microprobe with the total length of 3 cm, which the needle was about 5 mm and <b>hand</b> <b>shank</b> was about 2. 5 cm. Selected 140 cases with dry eyes of meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD), patients were divided into two groups and made them have comparability. Observation group(n = 70) used microprobe to dredge meibomian gland pipe accompanied with drugs, hot compress and meibomian gland massage treatment. The control group(n = 70) was given conventional drugs, hot compress and meibomian massage treatment. To compare the tear break-up time(BUT), efficient rate and the cure rate of the two groups after treatment of 1 d, 1 wk, 2 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo and 3 mo. RESULTS: BUT were significantly prolonged in observation group and control group after treatment, and the observation group improved more obviously; the efficient rate and cure rate of the observation group were significantly higher than that of the control group after 1 d, 1 wk, 2 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo and 3 mo treatment. CONCLUSION:Using microprobe to unclog the meibomian gland tube can provide the fast and efficient, economical and practical treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD), which can be promoted in the clinical practice...|$|E
50|$|For {{production}} machine tools, the shank type is usually {{one of the}} following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown & Sharpe), a straight round shank to be held by a collet, or a straight round shank with a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid toolholder. For <b>hand</b> tools, the <b>shank</b> end is usually a square drive, intended for use with {{the same type of}} wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.|$|R
2500|$|When first published, Nineteen Eighty-Four was {{generally}} well received by reviewers. V. S. Pritchett, reviewing the novel for the New Statesman stated: [...] "I {{do not think}} I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation {{that it is impossible}} to put the book down." [...] P. H. Newby, reviewing Nineteen Eighty-Four for The Listener magazine, described it as [...] "the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since Rex Warner's The Aerodrome." [...] Nineteen Eighty-Four was also praised by Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster and Harold Nicolson. On the other <b>hand,</b> Edward <b>Shanks,</b> reviewing Nineteen Eighty-Four for The Sunday Times, was dismissive; Shanks claimed Nineteen Eighty-Four [...] "breaks all records for gloomy vaticination". C. S. Lewis was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was [...] "odious rather than tragic".|$|R
30|$|From motion capture, one {{can obtain}} marker/anatomical {{positions}} which allow the modeling of the skeletal structure. From changes in position over time, simple positional {{data can be}} translated into skeletal movement using the fundamental precepts of physics. This process is known as biomechanical modeling. A 15 -segment, full-body biomechanical model was built by using the 3 D capture data. The 15 segments were head, 2 segments trunk, upper arms, lower arms, <b>hands,</b> thighs, <b>shanks</b> and feet. The model allows the calculation of joints’ flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and rotation. The three component can characterize the kinematics of a skill, such as the maximum and minimum of a joint angle and its ROM (i.e. ROM = maximum − minimum). Additionally, muscles can {{be attached to the}} skeletal frame using anatomical knowledge regarding attachment points (Fig.  6 b). Thus, dynamic muscle lengthening or shortening can be determined in connection with skeletal movement. So do the muscular work patterns (eccentric, concentric, isometric). In such biomechanical modeling, inertial characteristics of the body were estimated using anthropometric “norms” found through statistical studies (Shan and Bohn 2003).|$|R
40|$|The central {{topic of}} this work is the {{comparison}} among different methods of determining the takeoff leg. We discussed, which methods are the most useful, and focused on determining the takeoff leg in the grade level. The sample contained 105 students of Primary Teacher Education program on The Faculty of Education in Ljubljana. The gathered information was organized in charts by Excel and evaluated by the statistic program SPSS. With the basic statistic evaluation we determined the frequency, relative frequency, average value and the standard deviation. For the calculated variables we also determined the minimal and maximal results. Based on the different variables: the standing long jump, the triple jump with and without the <b>hand</b> swing, <b>shank</b> and thigh size, block and standing start, {{it was determined that}} the majority of students takeoff leg is right. Furthermore we discovered that the methods of takeoff leg determination differ, what was also concluded from so far published literature. The measurements showed that the jumps with the takeoff leg are longer...|$|R

40|$|A {{paucity of}} {{research}} exists investigating the potential {{relationship between the}} technical and temporal strategy of accurate and inaccurate kickers in response to physical parameters modifiable by athletic conditioning. While recent studies have produced improvements in performance when kicking for distance following structured resistance training interventions, no {{studies have examined the}} influence of such interventions on the enhancement of kicking accuracy. It was therefore the purpose of this thesis to extend scientific understanding of those mechanisms which might underpin accurate kicking performances through examining kinanthropometric, strength and muscularity profiles of accurate and inaccurate kickers in Australian Football using a series of research studies. In particular, studies one and two established valid and reliable measurement protocols, while studies three, four and five quantified whole-body composition, anthropometrics, segmental masses of the lower limbs, unilateral and bilateral lower-body strength, and lower limb kinematics during the drop punt. Study one established a standardised and reliable body positioning and scan analysis model using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) to accurately identify and assess appendicular segmental mass components (upper arm, forearm, <b>hand,</b> thigh, <b>shank</b> and foot segments); producing very high intra-tester reliability (CV ≤ 2. 6...|$|R
