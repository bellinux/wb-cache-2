25|$|In February 2014, {{the brand}} {{returned}} to the Southern California-based chain as it reinvented itself as wholesome grocery store under supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, who purchased the struggling British concept on 2013. Cage-free eggs and four types of organic milk sporting the “Wild Oats Marketplace” label were sold in 167 stores at first, including 102 locations in Southern California. Brown eggs are equipped with “Just Laid” stickers on cartons and “hen laying” <b>date</b> <b>stamps</b> on each egg. The “Portlandia”-inspired move comes as more consumers demand transparency on food origin and animal welfare from grocers.|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 1941, the New York Central inaugurated a new {{stainless-steel}} streamlined (Budd) train, {{powered by}} a streamlined J-3a Hudson (4-6-4) steam locomotive.

A prototype device that supports TUP, language independent textscTUP and <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> {{is used in the}} evaluation. Text entry speed for TUP is found to be 6 - 7 words per minute for novice users. This is approximately 30 % faster than the <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> method. ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1938 {{industrial}} designer Henry Dreyfuss {{was commissioned by}} the New York Central to design streamlined train sets in Art Deco style, with the locomotive and passenger cars rendered in blues and grays (the colors of NYC). The streamlined sets were inaugurated on June 15, 1938. His design {{was probably the most}} famous American passenger train. Like many express passenger trains through the mid-1960s, the 20th Century Limited carried an East Division (E.D.) Railway Post Office (R.P.O.) car operated by the Railway Mail Service (RMS) of the United States Post Office Department which was staffed by USPOD clerks as a [...] "fast mail" [...] on each of its daily runs.

5000|$|In Poland, {{the first}} system for {{denoting}} abbreviated dates used Roman numerals for months (e.g., 11 XI 1918 for Independence Day).The current year {{can be replaced}} by the abbreviation [...] ""and the current month can similarly {{be replaced by the}} abbreviation [...] "", in which case the year is omitted altogether.The Roman notation still prevails in private communication, except for <b>date</b> <b>stamps</b> where Arabic numerals are used (as in [...] "Berlin, 9.05.1945").The authorities changed the order of the <b>date</b> <b>stamps</b> in 1979 to follow Polish industrial standard PN-90/N-01204 (Polskie Normy) similar to ISO 8601; 1981-12-13 has been the preferred format since then.|$|E
