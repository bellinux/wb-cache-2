In our study we try to assess the {{causality}} link between {{a number of the}} international economic integration politico-economic factors, institutions and basic production factors with the growth of the economy. We form a sample of 18 post-socialist countries, including Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries-members the European Union, and the rest of CEE non-members countries and CIS countries, who have not acquired the membership in the EU, including Ukraine. The time period of our study is 23 years, starting from 1991 – the year of independence of Ukraine till 2013 – {{the last year for which}} statistics are published for our group of a corresponding list of indicators that make up our interest. In the estimating equation we use econometric analysis panel data by least squares method with fixed effects transformation to eliminate countries’ heterogeneity. In the study we use such determinant of the institutions quality as the Index of Economic Freedom (Heritage Foundation), and we investigate various components of the Index of Economic Freedom (freedom of ownership, freedom of trade, freedom from corruption, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment).</b> We assume that institutions towards freedom of foreign trade and reducing corruption will have a greater effect on the economy of the investigated countries. It is advisable to attach to the international economic integration politico-economic factors the indicator of foreign trade taxation as a measure of tariff barriers, international aid programs of the foreign donors and the European institutions to assess their role for the economic growth of the countries surveyed, and we take into account the capital and the labor as the basic factors of production. Methodology. The methods of synthesis, logic, abstraction and analysis are used in the study. On a sample of 18 post-socialist countries (CEE and CIS) for the period of 23 years (1991 - 2013) we had conducted the econometric panel analysis by the method of least squares with fixed effects transformation method, in order to avoid the heterogeneity across countries. The statistics of World Bank, IMF, OECD is used in the study. Results of the survey showed that the specifications test results confirm the positive role of the international aid programs to support the growth of GDP, in addition, we can assume the existence of positive effects simultaneously improving institutions and the positive effect of the external trade determinants. Practical implications. This study makes it possible to confirm that in terms of economic policies, countries that are in the integrating process should focus their efforts on improving the institutions in the trade area. Value/originality. The results of both models provide a better understanding of the impact of political, economic and institutional factors on the economic integration process of Central Eastern Europe countries and Commonwealth of Independent States.

40|$|Pension {{reform has}} become a major policy issue for both {{developed}} and developing countries in recent years. In developing countries the impact of these reforms on the development of their financial markets is critical. However, the initial expectations that pension reforms in developing countries would bring broad benefits and result in faster market development have not materialised. A particular problem has been that governments have imposed restrictions on the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> pension funds’ <b>investment</b> decisions. In particular, they have a tendency to enforce home bias in investment behaviour. This paper provides a non-technical introduction to home bias and its role in stock market development, and uses the Polish experience as a case study. It discusses the main arguments for portfolio diversification, the primary side effects that emerge from locking funds into underdeveloped equity markets, and highlights the problems the Polish pension funds face {{as a result of the}} “enforced” home bias policy of the Polish authorities. The findings support the view that enforced home bias has a negative impact on the local stock market development, on the performance of pension reform. pension reforms, home bias, stock market development, emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|At the {{operating}} {{stage of the}} investment cycle problems of evaluation of capital investments efficiency do not rise. At the same time, {{the development of the}} concepts of corporate management provides the ability to apply them in the performance management by approach of companies-objects of capital investments. During the research were used the methods: Statistical Simulation Methods, correlation-regression analysis, the system of lump-sum equations, direct functional relationships. The attempt to justify the management of efficiency system of capital investment from the position of the object of capital investment for the operational phase of the investment cycle was made. The technique of constructing a model of cause-and-effect relationship of efficiency system of capital investment was proposed, its strengths and weaknesses was identified. The system performance indicators can be significantly expanded and built in the context of capital investors (stakeholders) and time horizons (short-, medium-and long-term). The number of indicators of capital investments and exogenous factors, too, can be greatly expanded. So, the inverse relationship of capital investments and {{of the effects of the}} trade with indices of <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment,</b> of trade freedom and business freedom can not be described positively. This situation is caused by incorrect calculations of these indexes, or the excess of influence of mental factors compared with the economic laws for the process of investing capital in the trading business of Ukraine and entrepreneurship. The tendencies of stochastic dependence of the investment capital and of the obtained effects undoubtedly manifested in indicators of efficiency. There are some distortions in the understanding of the optimistic and pessimistic forecasts from the point of view of trends in the external environment and trading business in Ukraine. In particular, the pessimistic forecast of total capital return (0. 3 grn.) was better than the optimistic (0. 2 grn.), and the same with respect to the turnover on UAH 1 capital. This indicates a decrease of the total capital return of trading companies (more rapid growth of capital investment as compared to the effects obtained from them), with the progressive development of the external environment factors. The same is observed for the non-current assets returns, for fixed assets and current assets returns, and profitability of total capital, of non-current capital, of fixed assets, of current assets, and for the profit per one enterprise. Other trends of performance indicators consistent with the general trends in the development of Ukraine's economy. Thus, performance management of capital investments in the business at the operational stage of the investment cycle can be carried out by modeling the cause-effect relationships of the system performance indicators and system of exogenous factors, of indicators of capital investments and of the obtained effects. The model can be built on the system of lump-sum equations, which are calculated by the stochastic and functional links between the above indicators. The system performance indicators can be significantly expanded and built in the context of capital investors (stakeholders) and time horizons (short-, medium-and long-term). The number of indicators of capital investments and exogenous factors, too, can be greatly expanded. The system of equations can also include the functional relationship between the planned indicators. Performance management of capital investments in the business from the perspective of the object of capital investments allows to predict, to monitor, and to analyze of the performance indicators system (as opposed to one or more integrated indicators) over the full life cycle of the enterprise-object of capital investments. To some extent, forward-looking indicators of efficiency can be manipulated by changing the parameters of capital investments (dependend management indicators). The disadvantages of the approach are: 1) the proposed method of construction of the model can be applied only in the context of stable development of the economy, else stochastic communication parameters may not be set, 2) technique requires a large sample of statistical information, 3) it is sometimes difficult to establish the factors that actually have impact on the performance, that is, made calculations may not lead to the identification of mathematical functions...|$|E
