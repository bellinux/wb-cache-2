5|$|As {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer answerable to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He {{was responsible for the}} technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been working for him on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, Priscilla Greene, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy's groups from the University of California, J. H. Williams' <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Minnesota, Joe McKibben's <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Wisconsin, Felix Bloch's group from Stanford University and Marshall Holloway's from Purdue University. He also secured the services of Hans Bethe and Robert Bacher from the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, Edward Teller, Robert F. Christy, Darol K. Froman, Alvin C. Graves and John H. Manley and his <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and Robert R. Wilson and his group, which included Richard Feynman, that had been performing Manhattan Project research at Princeton University. They brought with them a great deal of valuable scientific equipment. Wilson's group dismantled the cyclotron at Harvard University and had it shipped to Los Alamos; McKibben's brought two Van de Graaff generators from Wisconsin; and Manley's brought the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator from the University of Illinois.|$|E

5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E

5|$|The main {{competition}} {{consisted of}} two groups, each with four English, and four Italian teams. Each team would play four group games – against every team in its <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other nation.

5|$|Although {{suffering}} numerous tactical reverses, operationally the Germans diverted the Allied First Army <b>Group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower Ardennes area. In {{the process}} his forces, {{along with the}} Luftwaffe depleted Prioux' Cavalry Corps. When news of the German breakthrough at Sedan reached Prioux, he withdrew from Gembloux. With the Gembloux gap breached, the German Panzer Corps, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, were no longer required by Army Group B and were handed over to Army Group A. Army Group B would continue its own offensive to force {{the collapse of the}} Meuse front. The Army Group {{was in a position to}} advance westward to Mons, outflank the BEF and Belgian Army protecting the Dyle–Brussels sector, or turn south to outflank the French 9th Army.|$|E

5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There {{he joined a}} <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, {{and at the top}} of Malone's Gulley were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E
5|$|At dusk on 17 November, Regimental HQ and A Squadron {{advanced}} to El Beida; C Squadron bivouacked at El Rabta and B Squadron screened the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade as it {{advanced to}}wards Bir Gibni. C Squadron crossed the frontier towards Bir Gibni the following day, joined by Regimental Headquarters and A Squadron {{later in the}} morning. BSquadron patrolled the Indian brigade's flank near Bir Gibni and was fired on by German Panzer III tanks. One Panzer III was disabled by 2-pounder anti-tank guns, and was towed away by a retreating Panzer. B Squadron pulled back a mile at night and laagered. At 15:00 on 19 November, the regiment advanced towards Bir Gibni, with C Squadron forward and A Squadron in reserve. C Squadron reached the Trigh el Abd and observed the British 4th Armoured Brigade fighting a battle <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 21st Panzer Division. B Squadron was transferred back to regimental command late on 19 November, after providing flank support to the 7th Indian Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Australian ornithologist Dom Serventy {{visited the}} island in 1945 but left no {{published}} account. In 1959, a <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Western Australia's Department of Zoology, accompanied by the English botanist Mary Gillham, travelled to the island; a brief article on its physiography, vegetation and vertebrate fauna was published the following year by Glen Storr. More recent visitors have included P. R.

5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the spelling for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid justification for assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1985 {{death of}} Roger Gambill, Kingston Trio {{personnel}} changed several times, though Shane and Grove remained constants. Bob Haworth, a veteran folk performer {{who had worked}} as a member of The Brothers Four for many years, initially replaced Gambill from 1985 through 1988 and again from 1999 through 2005. In 1988, original member Nick Reynolds rejoined the band until his final retirement in 1999. When heart disease forced Bob Shane's retirement from touring in March 2004, he was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn. A year later, following Haworth's departure, Grove and Zorn were joined by Rick Dougherty, who had performed for a time with Zorn as second-generation members of another popular folk <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, The Limeliters.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
5|$|Lawton lies {{in an area}} {{typical of}} the Great Plains, with prairie, few trees, and flat {{topography}} with gently rolling hills. The region {{north of the city}} consists of the Wichita Mountains, including Mount Scott and Mount Pinchot, the area's highest peaks. The area consists mostly of Permian Post Oak Conglomerate limestone on the northern sections of the city. In the south sections of the city, Permian Garber sandstone is commonly found with some Hennessey Group shale. Area creeks including East Cache Creek contain deposits of Quaternary alluvium. To the northwest, the Wichita Mountains consist primarily of Wichita Granite <b>Group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cambrian era.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's central {{highlands}} {{were first}} inhabited between 200 BCE–300 CE by the island's earliest settlers, the Vazimba, {{who appear to}} have arrived by pirogue from southeastern Borneo and established simple villages in the island's dense forests. By the 15th century the Merina ethnic <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among existing Vazimba settlements ruled by local kings. In the mid-16th century these royal Merina villages (rovas)—now fortified with stone walls, gateways and deep defensive trenches—were united {{under the rule of}} King Andriamanelo (1540–1575), who initiated the first military campaigns to expel or assimilate the Vazimba population by force. Villages inhabited by the andriana (noble) class established by Andriamanelo typically contained a rova or palace compound.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E
