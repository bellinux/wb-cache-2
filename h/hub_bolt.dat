25|$|In May 2009, Tesla {{issued a}} recall for 345 Roadsters {{manufactured}} before April 22, 2009. Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes {{to tighten the}} rear, inner <b>hub</b> flange <b>bolts.</b> Using wording from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car. The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line, where the Roadster glider was built. Lotus also recalled some Elise and Exige vehicles for the same reason.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{procedure}} is presented that {{was applied for}} wheelset components during {{the development of a}} light-weight wheel from Schwäbische Hüttenwerke (SHW). The procedure requires knowledge of the actual wheel forces that occur in service with respect to magnitude, frequency of occurence and also their correlation in time. These forces were determined for an inter-city train and were used to derive characteristic cumulative frequency of occurence distributions for a service life of 5 mill. kilometers. The data were also used to determine a load programm for prooftests regarding adequate service life in the existing test facility for wheelsets. Based on the above mentioned test-load program, fatigue strength tests can be carried out under typical and important loading conditions such as: straight run, concerning, passage over switches and sinusoidal running for all component-parts of the wheelset, i. e. wheel, <b>hub,</b> <b>bolted</b> connection, and the axle. Also described in the paper are the development of a light-weight wheel and the results of the tests that led to the optimally shaped and dimensioned wheel design. Achieved was a reduction of 30 % in weight compared with standard wheel as well as improved dynamic vehicle behaviour. Finally a further advanced test procedure and a description of a new test facility for proof-testing of service life is presented. (LBF...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s the Dana 70HD was offered. The axle tubes were {{increased}} to 4 inches diameter and carrier bearings were larger and thicker, the axle shafts were 35 spline only. These upgrades gave the Dana 70HD a gross axle rating of 10,000 lbs. The Dana 70 front drive axles {{used in the}} Chevrolet Kodiaks and GMC Topkicks also had these features. This axle was standard for the Big Three (automobile manufacturers) dual rear wheel trucks until 1985, when Ford started using the Sterling 10.25 rear axle. However Ford still kept the Dana 70HD an option until the Dana 80 was made available. The axle was available or optional for the Big Three until 1994 when Dodge used the Dana 80 for its dual rear wheel trucks instead. The Dana 70HD is still seen in commercial applications today. In the UK the 70HD Dana axles were license built by Salisbury Engineering in an early 10/23 spline version with a 4.3 metric tonne (9500lbs) rating for the Ford A-series truck with a European 6x205mm DIN standard <b>hub</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern.|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of the existing components, which are built of several adjacent components (wheel, <b>hub,</b> bearings, <b>bolts</b> etc.), can change greatly the properties, above all due {{to the influence of}} neighbouring components with differing levels of rigidity, changing pre-tension ratios of the bolt and shrinkage fit connections, different thicknesses of the layers of paint and different temperatures. The complex, coincidental, multi-axial loads negatively affect the durability, which can lead to various failure mechanisms. With the help of standardised, accelerated load programmes and incorporating special event loads, the experimental simulation in 2 and 4 axial wheel-hub test rigs (Biaxial Wheel Test Rig) is performed in order to find an optimum solution in the early development phases...|$|R
40|$|Environmental effects which {{significantly}} reduce the fatigue life of metals are discussed. Corrosion fatigue {{is a major concern}} in the engineering application of high strength fasteners in marine environments. The corrosion fatigue failure of an AISI 41 L 4 O high strength steel blade to <b>hub</b> attachment <b>bolt</b> at the MOD-OA 200 kW wind turbine generator was investigated. The reduction of fatigue strength of AISI 41 L 4 O in marine environments and to obtain similar corrosion fatigue data for candidate replacement materials was studied. The AISI 4140, PH 13 - 8 Mo stainless steel, alloy 718 and alloy MP- 35 N were tested in axial fatigue at a frequency of 20 Hz in dry air and natural seawater. The fatigue data are fitted by regression equations to allow determination of fatigue strength for a given number of cycles to failure...|$|R
50|$|The estate {{version of}} the 850 finally went on sale in February 1993, on all markets. 6 months later, in August, the 850 Turbo was {{introduced}} for the 1994 model year as was the new 2.5L 10V engine. A facelift with new bumpers front and rear, new headlights and indicators {{on the outside and}} new switchgear on the inside updated the car visually. On the technical side of things Volvo switched from 4 bolt to 5 <b>bolt</b> <b>hubs,</b> made ABS standard on all markets and changed to a new A/C system.|$|R
50|$|The {{bolt pattern}} determines {{the number and}} {{position}} of the mounting holes to allow the wheel to be <b>bolted</b> to the <b>hub.</b> As the <b>bolts</b> are evenly spaced, the number of bolts determines the pattern. For example: smaller cars have three (Citroën 2CV, Renault 4, some Peugeot 106s and Citroën Saxos). Compact cars may have four bolts. Most United States passenger cars have five bolts. Pickup trucks, large SUVs, and armored vehicles may {{have as many as}} five, six, eight, or ten. It is not unheard of to find vehicles with even more, such as enormous coal mining transporters that may have twelve.|$|R
50|$|The Terryville Waterwheel {{is located}} in Terryville, a {{historic}} 19th-century manufacturing district of eastern Plymouth, and now the town's main commercial center. It {{is located on the}} north side of Main Street (United States Route 6) on the western bank of the swiftly flowing Pequabuck River. The wheel is built out of wood and iron, and is mounted in its original wheel well formed out of rubblestone capped in concrete. It is 22 ft in diameter and 7 ft wide, and is sheltered by a form-fit shelter erected in 1951. Most of the wheel's parts are pressure-treated wood, replacing original materials in a 1990-91 restoration. The axle of the wheel is cast iron, with a cast iron hub providing attachment mortises for the wheel's arms. The arms are fastened to the <b>hub</b> with metal <b>bolts,</b> and are cross braced with iron tie rods.|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has {{a holder}} (6) for rotatably mounting a wheel (3) and pivoting it into different camber angles. The tire engages the inner {{surface of a}} rotatable drum (11). Loading units (9, 10) apply a vertical or radial force and a lateral or axial loading arrangement to the holder. The loading arrangements {{are linked to the}} holder, which can be displaced so that the wheel pivots about the wheel contact point for automatic camber adjustment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - At least one ring on the drum's inner surface is arranged next to the tire and wheel edge as a run-up ring and is chamfered on the side facing the tire. USE - For testing motor vehicle wheels, tires, <b>hubs,</b> bearings and <b>bolts,</b> especially with broad tires on twinned commercial vehicle wheels. ADVANTAGE - Enables testing under substantially operational conditions with different tires...|$|R
50|$|The 2nd {{generation}} of VFR400R was the VFR400R NC24, produced for the 1987 and 1988 model years, the first production Honda motorcycle to utilize an ELF-designed Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm (which later {{became one of}} the trademarks of the Honda VFR series). Discontinued with this model were the hydraulically actuated clutch which was switched back to a cable system, and the TRAC anti dive system on the front forks. Styling remained close to the NC21, with the NC24 keeping the single large headlight and the exhaust silencer on the right hand side. This model also had a 180° deg crank firing engine as with the nc21, but redline was raised to 14000 rpm. The NC24 was available in three colour schemes in 1987 (including an official Rothmans replica), and one in 1988. Note that the rear wheel on the NC24 was held onto the <b>hub</b> with 4 <b>bolts</b> (sometimes hidden with a plastic 'fake' single nut).|$|R
40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed flanged joint design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and <b>hub</b> transmit the <b>bolt</b> load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium. The results of the individual tests and the combinations of load are presented and discussed...|$|R
