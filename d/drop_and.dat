5|$|Originally, dubstep {{releases}} {{had some}} structural {{similarities to other}} genres like drum and bass and UK garage.

40|$|In this paper, {{the notion}} of {{declarative}} goals as used in agent programming is central. Declarative goals describe desirable states and are updated during the execution of an agent. These goal dynamics are analyzed by distinguishing and formalizing various notions of goal <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> goal adoption. Furthermore, possible motivations for an agent to drop or adopt goals are identified. Based on these motivations, we define specific mechanisms for implementing <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption. We show how these mechanisms {{are related to the}} general definitions of <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption...|$|R

5|$|At its opening, Chang {{claimed the}} record for the tallest {{vertical}} loop of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Chang surrendered its titles.|$|E

5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E

40|$|The {{detailed}} aerodynamic {{structure of}} air-assisted swirl atomizer sprays is investigated in this paper. In contrast to previously published papers on spray characterization, special {{emphasis is placed}} on the region near the atomizer exit where significant variation of the mean <b>drop</b> size <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> velocity occurs. Simple correlations are found for the spray mean <b>drop</b> size <b>and</b> some initial input parameters. Measurements of <b>drop</b> acceleration <b>and</b> deceleration can be well related to the line-of-sight variations in mean <b>drop</b> size <b>and</b> number density. It is found that the initial <b>drop</b> acceleration <b>and</b> spray dispersion cause the initial decrease of axial mean <b>drop</b> diameters <b>and</b> subsequent <b>drop</b> deceleration causes the increase of mean drop diameters...|$|R
