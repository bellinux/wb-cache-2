40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandBy {{the use of}} {{commercial}} equipment whose original purpose was to provide alarm monitoring (fire and burglar) over telephone lines, a command and data system was constructed to control an undersea dredge. The system was designed around the Larse Corporation Data Communicators (trademark), and only a PAM multiplexer and a <b>digital</b> <b>demultiplexer</b> were added {{to make the system}} perform. The system requirements were analyzed, and only after the candidate design was agreed upon were the ideas put to paper. The system was designed in modules, with the various components grouped according to their function, to simplify interconnecting and test/checkout. The system has performed well, no component failures have occurred to date, and all data and command functions have worked as expected...|$|E
40|$|A trichromophoric {{molecule}} {{consisting of}} a porphyrin linked to both a dihydropyrene and a dihydroindolizine-type photochrome, in combination with a third harmonic generating crystal, functions as a 1 : 2 <b>digital</b> <b>demultiplexer</b> with photonic inputs and outputs. Each of the two photochromes may be cycled independently between two metastable forms, leading to four photoisomers, three of which {{are used in the}} demultiplexer. These isomers interact photochemically with the porphyrin in order to yield the demultiplexer function. With the address input (1064 -nm light) turned off, one Output of the device (porphyrin fluorescence) tracks the state of the data input (532 -nm light). When the address input is turned on, the second output (absorbance at 572 nm) tracks the state of the data input, while the first output remains off. The demultiplexer does not require chemical or electrical inputs, and can cycle through its operational sequences multiple times...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{extensive}} comparison among alternative algorithms {{for the implementation}} of a <b>digital</b> <b>demultiplexer</b> has been carried out. The computational complexity, the performances and the accuracy with respect to the quantization effects (quantization noise and coefficient quantization) have been evaluated for the different algorithms. The selected digital architecture has been designed to be compliant with the Eutelsat specifications for the Skyplex Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) television system (Re, M., Cardarilli, G. C., Del Re, A. and Lojacono R. (2000) “FPGA Implementation of a Demux based on a multirate filter bank”. International Symposium on Circuits and Systems 2000, 5 (May), 353 – 356). At present, a more expensive and complex analog structure, based on six Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters, is used. The new digital architecture has been mapped on six Altera Flex 10 K- 100 devices. The final test bed, that includes a complete interface to the demodulator, has been implemented on a four-layers PCB...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an advanced ASIC architecture for a wideband <b>digital</b> frequency <b>demultiplexer</b> designed for on board satellite communication systems. The structure {{is able to}} handle up to 32 uniformly spaced channels extracted from a digital, real frequency division multiplexed signal sampled at 672 MHz; contiguous demultiplexing and remultiplexing is supported. An efficient demux two-stage parallel architecture was developed where all internal coefficients (including the FFT ones) are coded with canonic signed digit technique allowing area saving with respect to 2 's complement code. Performance evaluations, in terms of bit error rate, noise to power ratio and gate complexity, were carried out for the architecture definition. Subsequently the design was coded in VHDL and synthesised on a 0. 18 μm CMOS technology by means of Synopsys™ tools...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the optical Fourier transform and cyclic prefix in an all-optical OFDM transmitter can be simultaneously implemented using a liquid crystal on silicon wavelength selective switch (WSS). The design uses phase-modulated optical pulses at the inputs of the WSS; this has the advantage that the optical modulators are only sampled by the optical pulses once per data-symbol, so that the transition times between the data symbols are irrelevant {{to the performance of}} the system, allowing slow optical modulators to be used. Furthermore, each input of the WSS can be assigned to any combination of output subcarrier frequencies, including frequencies unrelated to the modal frequencies of the comb source. This is especially useful for testing in-service ultra-high bandwidth systems by applying additional wavelengths. As an example, we generate a 10. 08 Tb/s signal and transmit along 857. 4 km of fiber using 252 10 -Gbaud subcarriers with a 10 % cyclic prefix. We use an optically-banded <b>digital</b> subcarrier <b>demultiplexer</b> to simultaneously detect three subcarriers using a single coherent receive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Self-assembly is {{a process}} in which basic units {{aggregate}} under attractive forces to form larger compound structures. Recent theoretical work has shown that pseudo-crystalline self-assembly can be algorithmic, in the sense that complex logic can be programmed into the growth process [26]. This theoretical work builds on the theory of twodimensional tilings [8], using rigid square tiles called Wang tiles [24] for the basic units of self-assembly, and leads to Turing-universal models such as the Tile Assembly Model [28]. Using the Tile Assembly Model, we show how algorithmic self-assembly can be exploited for fabrication tasks such as constructing the patterns that define certain <b>digital</b> circuits, including <b>demultiplexers,</b> RAM arrays, pseudowavelet transforms, and Hadamard transforms. Since DNA self-assembly appears to be promising for implementing the arbitrary Wang tiles [30, 13] needed for programming in the Tile Assembly Model, algorithmic self-assembly methods such as those presented in this paper may eventually become a viable method of arranging molecular electronic components [18], such as carbon nanotubes [10, 1], into molecular-scale circuits. ...|$|R
