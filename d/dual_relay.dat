In the proposed schemes, two users first sequentially broadcast their respective information to all the relays. We propose two RS schemes, a single relay selection with NC and a <b>dual</b> <b>relay</b> selection with NC. For both schemes, the selected relay(s) perform NC on the received signals sent from the two users and forward them to both users. The proposed schemes are analyzed and the exact bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived and verified through Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the <b>dual</b> <b>relay</b> selection with NC outperforms other considered relay selection schemes in two-way relay channels. The results also reveal that the proposed NC relay selection schemes provide a selection gain compared to a NC scheme with no relay selection, and a network coding gain relative to a conventional relay selection scheme with no NC.

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the performance enhancement of <b>dual</b> <b>relay</b> cooperative wireless network by using Amplify and Forward (AF) relaying protocol in Rician fading channel with different K-factors. The bit error rate (BER) and BER gain by using AF scenario in Rician fading channel are derived. The results obtained from the proposed models are compared to AF scenario in Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. It is found that the proposed BER model of AF cooperative scenario outperform as compared to non cooperative scenario in terms of less BER. It is indicated that at lower values of K (i. e., at severe fading as well as weak LOS reception), the proposed model of AF scenario in Rician fading channel showed less BER as compared to AF scenario in Rayleigh fading channel (i. e., K= 0, which denotes severe fading as well as the scenario where LOS component completely vanishes and reception becomes non-LOS). It is shown that at severe fading (i. e., at lower K values) while keeping lower signal to noise ratio (SNR) the proposed model showed less BER. However, the proposed model shows constant BER as K approaches to infinity (i. e., the BER performance approaches AWGN channel error performance) while keeping low SNR values. It is also revealed that with the increase in K values 1 to 60 (i. e., decrease in severe fading to lowest fading as well as an increase from weak to strong LOS reception) the proposed model showed less BER and high BER gain as compared to Nakagami-m channel while keeping low values of SNR (i. e., 1 - 18 dB).

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{high-speed}} Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) applications has motivated the use of millimetre waves operation in Ka band, point-to-multipoint fixed cellular with a large bandwidth of 0. 5 – 1. 55 GHz. This service {{is also known as}} Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS). It has the advantages of rapid installation, scalability, high capacity, ease of deployment and low initial infrastructure costs; and could be an attractive alternative to other broadband access technologies. However, the service is limited up to 8 km of coverage area due to line of sight constraints. Co-channel interference and rain attenuation are major limitation factors to system performance. This study is conducted to analyse LMDS performance based on local rain cell profile. The long-term cumulative rainfall rate was obtained from weather radar data. This data is compared with ITU-R recommendation and data from rain gauge network. The influence of rain length distribution probability to different rain rate thresholds had been studied from the database for an area size of 25 km 2. The target is to design LMDS that reaches up to 5 km of cell size service with good availability. Four architectures of fixed BWA were investigated in terms of a carrier to interference ratio (C/I) using three types of modulations which are QPSK, 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM. The rain cell profile results shows that higher rain rates experience shorter rain length. The rain rates at 0. 01 percentage of time for radar data in UTM is 106. 25 mm/hr and rain length was less than 0. 46 km. Besides, during low rain rate events, the LMDS service coverage has better performance than clear sky. This is due to fact that the low rain rates present low attenuation to the desired signal but causes high attenuation to interfering base station signals, resulting in better C/I performance. During heavy precipitation, the effective service coverage area will reach to less than 2 km using QPSK in conventional architecture at 99. 99 % availability. In addition, the co-channel interference can be reduced by using certain design-rule for various architectures. Moreover, it was observed that by decreasing LMDS cell size, the service coverage performance would improve. Two methods had been proposed to improve the performance. One is to use different architectures namely conventional with 4 frequency reuse, simplex ring <b>relaying</b> and <b>dual</b> ring <b>relaying.</b> The second method is to reduce the LMDS service size, i. e. to determine appropriate cell size which offers 99. 99 % availability.

In addition, 5 km service cell size for 99. 98 % availability can be achieved by using dual ring architecture.
