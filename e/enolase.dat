25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting rid of them. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the <b>enolase</b> enzyme, as well as Chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer's {{early stages}} (I/II) are {{difficult}} to diagnose because most symptoms are nonspecific and thus of little use in diagnosis; as a result, it is rarely diagnosed until it spreads and advances to later stages (III/IV). Additionally, symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome. In patients in whom pregnancy is a possibility, BHCG level should be measured during the diagnosis process. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, neuron-specific <b>enolase,</b> and lactate dehydrogenase should be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger patients {{are more likely to}} have malignant germ cell tumors.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic lethality as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursing a synthetic lethality approach. Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes <b>enolase</b> 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range <b>enolase</b> inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the generalizability of the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E
2500|$|Microarray {{studies done}} on fish species exposed to hypoxia {{typically}} show a metabolic switch, that is, {{a decrease in}} the expression of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and an increase in expression of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism. Zebrafish embryos exposed to hypoxia decreased expression of genes involved in the citric acid cycle including, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, and increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis such as phosphoglycerate mutase, <b>enolase,</b> aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. A decrease in protein synthesis is an important response to hypoxia in order to decrease ATP demand for whole organism metabolic suppression. Decreases in the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, such as elongation factor-2 and several ribosomal proteins, have been shown in the muscle of the mudsucker and gills of adult zebrafish after hypoxia exposure [...]|$|E
2500|$|S100B is {{secreted}} by astrocytes or can spill from injured {{cells and}} enter the extracellular space or bloodstream. Serum levels of S100B increase in patients during the acute phase of brain damage. [...] Over the last decade, S100B {{has emerged as a}} candidate peripheral biomarker of bloodâ€“brain barrier [...] (BBB) permeability and CNS injury. [...] Elevated S100B levels accurately reflect the presence of neuropathological conditions including traumatic head injury or neurodegenerative diseases. [...] Normal S100B levels reliably exclude major CNS pathology. [...] Its potential clinical use in the therapeutic decision making process is substantiated by a vast body of literature validating variations in serum 100B levels with standard modalities for prognosticating the extent of CNS damage: alterations in neuroimaging, cerebrospinal pressure, and other brain molecular markers (neuron specific <b>enolase</b> and glial fibrillary acidic protein). [...] However, more importantly, S100B levels have been reported to rise prior to any detectable changes in intracerebral pressure, neuroimaging, and neurological examination findings. [...] Thus, the major advantage of using S100B is that elevations in serum or CSF levels provide a sensitive measure for determining CNS injury at the molecular level before gross changes develop, enabling timely delivery of crucial medical intervention before irreversible damage occurs. S100B serum levels are elevated before seizures suggesting that BBB leakage may be an early event in seizure development.|$|E

5000|$|Homozygous {{deletion}} of the 1p36 locus, {{which contains}} several candidate tumor suppressor genes, occurs in approximately 5% of glioblastoma (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. Deletion {{of this region}} often includes deletion of several passenger genes, including ENO1, which has been identified to confer collateral lethality with subsequent inhibition of its redundant paralogue ENO2. ENO1 encodes the major <b>enolase</b> isoform, accounting for >90% of cellular <b>enolase</b> activity. <b>Enolase</b> is responsible for conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in glycolysis. Cancer cells could be especially sensitized to inhibition of this pathway due to their frequent shift toward glycolysis, known as the 'Warburg effect'. Knockdown of ENO2 by shRNA inhibited growth, survival, and tumorigenic potential of ENO1-null cell lines over ENO1-intact cells. Additionally, the <b>enolase</b> inhibitor PhAH, with half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations around 20 nM, proved to be selectively toxic to ENO1-null cells over ENO1-intact cells or normal human astrocytes. Although this inhibitor did not show selective inhibition of the ENO1 isoform over ENO2, higher toxicity toward ENO1-null cells is explained by the decreased overall <b>enolase</b> expression in these cell lines, which only retain about 10% of their normal <b>enolase</b> activity. [...] SF2312, a natural antibiotic produced by Micromonospora and active against bacteria under anaerobic conditions, was also {{shown to be a}} potent inhibitor of <b>enolase,</b> with (IC50) concentrations ranging from 10-50 nM. This inhibitor exhibited increased potency toward ENO2 over ENO1 at concentrations above its IC50. Further, a strong selective toxicity of SF2312 toward multiple ENO1-deleted cell lines was observed; these effects were not observed in ENO1-rescued cells, were increased after SF2312 treatment compared to PhAH treatment, and were more potent during hypoxia. Cell death and inhibition of proliferation in SF2312 treated ENO1-deleted cells were preceded by a decrease in ATP and other high-energy phosphates, and the conversion of glucose to lactate was inhibited. These effects are consistent with the impacts of <b>enolase</b> inhibition upon glycolysis, and were reversible by ENO1 re-expression or ENO2 overexpression. Thus, pharmacological targeting of ENO2 offers a promising therapeutic target for cancers harboring ENO1 deletions, due to the redundancy and cell-essential function of these genes.|$|E
