This study use quantitative research design and secondary data from manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. By using purposive sampling in the observation period 2013 - 2015, obtained 225 observations. Data were analyzed using multiple linier regression analysis. Criteria for firm are a manufacturing company, company financial statements use rupiah currency, and data supporting the implementation of research. The result of this study showed that financial distress and majority <b>shareholding</b> <b>structure</b> has positively significant effect on tax aggressiveness.

However, up to now, the effect of <b>group</b> <b>structure</b> to crowd behavior has not been widely studied. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that modeling group-related behavior is a challenging task because of the many factors that need to be considered. This paper presents a uniformed framework for modeling different <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> in a pedestrian crowd. Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationships are considered and their effects on the group behavior are modeled. Crowd behavior simulations based on two different <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> are developed and promising results are obtained. I...|$|R
