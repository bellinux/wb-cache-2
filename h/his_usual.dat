However, he remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches.|$|E

5|$|Ian Fleming wrote The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January and February 1964, {{completing}} {{it by the}} beginning of March.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> practice {{elsewhere in the}} Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) {{abandons}} his methodical {{approach to}} life after failing to get a haircut from <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> barber, while Howard (Simon Helberg) has a rough time in his astronaut training.

5|$|Irwin R. Schyster {{remained}} in {{control for the}} majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid. Although the Kid hit several kicks, Schyster regained control every time. Schyster used <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> abdominal stretch while using the ring ropes for leverage before the Kid made a brief comeback by hitting a moonsault. Schyster hit a Write Off, however, and got the pin.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{executives}} {{balked at}} Hitchcock's proposal {{and refused to}} provide <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> budget. In response, Hitchcock offered to film Psycho quickly and inexpensively {{in black and white}} using his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive Joan Harrison.|$|E
5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other {{passages}} are bland and uniform, with some key areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> final overglaze or glossing.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Paris, Custine {{displayed}} <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> , {{which seemed to}} exasperate his political enemies. He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary. He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and shouts of Vive Custine! The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned in the Luxembourg. On 23 July, the news came that Mainz had capitulated; on 28 July came the news of the loss of Valenciennes.

5|$|Although McCool {{also played}} as a {{frontline}} batsman during his career, with a first-class average of 32.85 and 18 centuries, his batting performances during the tour were far below <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> standards, garnering only 306 runs at 20.40 with three half-centuries.

5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} year, Azazel began making demonic pacts with young individuals; {{in exchange for}} a wish, he would be allowed to enter their homes ten years later. Azazel eventually comes across Mary Campbell, the future mother of series protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester. After taking possession of her father (Mitch Pileggi), he kills her mother and stabs himself to kill his host. Mary's fiance, John Winchester, is the demon's next victim. Azazel makes <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> offer, giving her the chance to resurrect John, to produce a child he can use; now orphaned and alone, she reluctantly agrees without knowing his true intentions.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
