500|$|Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated upon Jinnah's death, [...] "How {{shall we}} judge him? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{angry with him}} often during the past years. But {{now there is no}} {{bitterness}} in my thought of him, only a great sadness for all that has been... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, but at what a cost and with what a difference from what he had imagined." [...] Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{added his}} name to an {{advertisement}} that appeared in The Times on 24 July 1967, which called for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma and was signed by sixty-five people, including the Beatles, Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, sixteen doctors, and two members of parliament. Epstein responded to questions about the advertisement by saying, [...] "My opinion is that pot smoking is definitely less harmful than drinking alcohol. I am not addicted to either, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> drunk and very 'high'." [...] In June 1967, after McCartney had admitted to LSD use, Epstein defended him to the media, stating {{that he had taken}} the drug, too.|$|E
500|$|On February4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach {{improved}} sketches {{for both}} sides. Beach {{had been under}} the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates 1775—1925; on February5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words [...] "PILGRIM" [...] and [...] "HUGUENOT" [...] respectively before [...] "HALF DOLLAR", and proposed that the word [...] "PATRIOT" [...] appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April19, the anniversary of both battles, is Patriot Day in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words [...] "THE CONCORD MINUTE MAN" [...] appear even if it was illegible, [...] "the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and so Mr. Stone and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> particular to come to an agreement as to all details." ...|$|E

500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E
2500|$|I {{reviewed}} {{my whole}} work in collecting indemnity and they [...] fully approved and {{are prepared to}} defend the course taken. The correspondents who have written {{were all in the}} dark, and had made no proper inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being done, but they did not come. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter. Dr. Sheffield thinks it better for the work that I return home now than wait a little longer and make my class reunion in 1902.|$|E
2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and stated [...] "Those {{of us who have}} looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. [...] "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E

60|$|This nearly made me drop with amazement. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{only about}} seventy-five dollars left, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> much afraid that I could not buy the mustang, {{let alone the}} pack-pony and saddle.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not in the least.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> {{a beauty}} {{and had never}} thought myself one, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} from this. It was all gone now.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "you {{will enjoy}} it immensely; {{you will find}} it very charming." [...] And just then I came upon a {{photograph}} of some nook in a foreign city which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> fond of, and which recalled tender memories. I discoursed (as I suppose) with a certain eloquence; my companion sat listening, breathless.|$|R

60|$|As I {{walked along}} in the sun I {{remember}}ed old Cotter's words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream.

6000|$|... "Look here, Mr. Sowerby.
