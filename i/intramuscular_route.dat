50|$|Proper {{diagnosis}} {{is essential for}} optimal treatment. Bacterial corneal ulcer require intensive fortified antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled {{at least five times}} a day. Alongside, supportive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of Keratomalacia, where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or <b>intramuscular</b> <b>route</b> is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical corticosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria and will often make the condition much worse.|$|E

The {{present study was}} accomplished in two phases: Phase 1 : Preliminary dose finding pilot study on 10 children.

Both the intranasal and intramuscular groups showed highly significant decrease in crying levels, motor movements and sensory perception levels, post-sedation (P < 0. 001). Though both the routes almost matched each other in their efficacy and safety profiles, the intranasal route showed a significantly faster pharmacodynamic profile in terms of faster onset, peak and recovery times (P < 0. 001).

40|$|International audienceAbstractA live {{attenuated}} Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) {{capable of}} constitutively secreting detoxified double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin (dmLT) was developed. The biologically adjuvanted strain was generated via transformation {{of a highly}} immunogenic SE JOL 1087 with a plasmid encoding dmLT gene cassette; the resultant strain was designated JOL 1641. A balanced-lethal host-vector system stably maintained the plasmid via auxotrophic host complementation with a plasmid encoded aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) gene. Characterization by western blot assay revealed the dmLT subunit proteins in culture supernatants of JOL 1641. For the investigation of adjuvanticity and protective efficacy, chickens were immunized via oral or <b>intramuscular</b> <b>routes</b> with PBS, JOL 1087 and JOL 1641. Birds immunized with JOL 1641 showed significant (P ≤  0. 05) increases in intestinal SIgA production at the 1 st and 2 nd weeks post-immunization via oral and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>routes,</b> respectively. Interestingly, while both strains showed significant splenic protection via intramuscular immunization, JOL 1641 outperformed JOL 1087 upon oral immunization. Oral immunization of birds with JOL 1641 significantly reduced splenic bacterial counts. The reduction in bacterial counts may be correlated with an adjuvant effect of dmLT that increases SIgA secretion in the intestines of immunized birds. The inclusion of detoxified dmLT in the strain did not cause adverse reactions to birds, nor did it extend the period of bacterial fecal shedding. In conclusion, we report here that dmLT could be biologically incorporated in the secretion system of a live attenuated Salmonella-based vaccine, and that this construction is safe and could enhance mucosal immunity, and protect immunized birds against wild-type challenge...|$|R

Since April 1982, the Palliative Care Unit of the Edmonton General Hospital has been using this method for symptom control, titrating the rate of infusion against the severity of the symptoms, when the oral route was no longer available. If incompatible drugs have to be given at the same time, or if two drugs have to be given at different rates, two sites are used simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Gene {{transfer}} to experimental lung grafts {{has been shown}} to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute rejection. The optimal delivery route should produce high lung expression with no inflammation and minimal systemic expression. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the optimal gene transfer route for use in experimental lung transplantation. Methods: F 344 rats were injected with 2. 9 × 1010 plaque-forming units of adenovirus vector encoding β-galactosidase through intratracheal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or <b>intramuscular</b> delivery <b>routes</b> and killed 48 hours later. Gene expression was measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Intratracheal delivery produces significantly greater gene expression in the lung (75, 350 ± 47, 288 pg/ 100 μg of protein, P <. 001 vs intravenous, intraperitoneal, and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>routes)</b> and minimal systemic expression (nonsignificant in serum, kidney, liver, spleen, and muscle vs that seen in control animals, P =. 016 for heart). Immunohistochemistry staining showed β-galactosidase expression in the bronchial epithelium of lungs transfected through the intratracheal route with mild inflammation. Conclusions: Intratracheal gene transfer provides significant expression in the lung with mild to no inflammation and minimal systemic expression. This delivery strategy has tremendous potential in experimental lung transplant models to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute allograft rejection and should be investigated further.
