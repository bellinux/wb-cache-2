These maps display a high level of dependence by these markets on foreign sources as the serial depletion of local fisheries resources forced the fleets in search for new seafood supplies well beyond their domestic waters. The acquisition of foreign (and high seas) seafood by these markets is conducted through two channels: by dispatching <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> that directly exploit foreign stocks; and by importing catch landed elsewhere by local fleets. The results also demonstrate that each of the three major markets occupies a zone of influence within which it is dominant.

40|$|Before the {{adoption}} of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) in 1982, the right of states to fish in the seas was in a remarkable state of flux. States unilaterally and arbitrarily declared for themselves preposterous breadths of the sea as coming under their exclusive <b>fishing</b> jurisdictions. <b>Waters</b> off the coast of developing countries also came under unregulated large scale <b>fishing</b> by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> of developed countries, giving rise to resource over-exploitation. The LOSC {{in a number of ways}} infused stability and certainty in the fishing rights of states and enhanced the chances for the optimum utilisation of world fisheries. This article examines the various ways the LOSC has stabilised and enhanced fishing rights among states. It argues that although the Convention creates opportunities for the protection and optimal utilisation of fishery resources among developing countries of the world, these countries have yet to take advantage of the Convention opportunities due to numerous challenges, endogenous and exogenous, confronting them...|$|R
40|$|Relations between coastal {{countries}} and <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> from non-adjacent countries changed radically in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. This {{was primarily a}} consequence of the declaration of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) by many coastal states in the years leading up to the close of the negotiations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. Most significantly, by recognizing the right of coastal states to determine how their waters were to be exploited, the UNCLOS provided a legal basis and economic motivation for the negotiation of access agreements between coastal states and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets.</b> This paper examines some of the economic issues which arise out of such agreements, particularly as they relate to relations between relatively poor coastal states and <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> from richer non-adjacent countries.

Factors related to the characteristics of the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleet (ie, relative discard rates, fleet infractions, changes in fleet efficiency, and the mobility of the fleet) and the characteristics of the coastal country (ie, public debt and discount rates, capital constraints, access to overseas markets, and national political considerations) are examined in order to cast light on the incentives for signing the agreements.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} a group of eight Pacific Island coastal States in exercising their sovereign rights for the EEZ {{to take control of the}} tuna fishery and reduce dominance of the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets.</b> The group is established under the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries Common Interest, with the membership including the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Known widely as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, the group has adopted a cooperative framework and work together to establish a number of instruments to facilitate the co-ordination and harmonisation the management of the common fish stocks within their EEZs. In doing this, the Parties to the Nauru Agreement were asserting and protecting their sovereign rights, creating economic opportunities for their people, and conserving and managing the tuna fish stock. The thesis argues that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement has taken control of their tuna fishery through the introduction of the instruments such as the minimum terms and conditions for access under the First, Second and Third Implement Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement, the Palau Arrangement for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery to limit fishing effort and the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement for Regional Access which provide preferential treatment for the domestic and/or locally-based vessels.

40|$|Abstract only. Indian Ocean Tuna {{fisheries}} after a {{rapid development}} period from seventies {{to the end}} of the last century are faced with challenges including: the fishing capacity control, the profitability improvement, and the limitation of impacts on high seas biodiversity. In this area, tuna species are exploited by coastal states as well as <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations within and beyond exclusive economic zones (EEZ). This complex system where countries are exploiter or/and owner of migratory resources is also subjected to exogenous forcing factors such as: markets (tuna prices, fuel costs), environment (ENSO effects, climate change), and geopolitical relationships. A better sharing of the fishing rent between both regional and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> countries through counterpart agreements, bargaining and royalties remains to highlight. It looks also important to assess the pertinence and impacts of different management options. Among them, marine protected areas (MPA) implementation within either EEZ or international waters is currently discussed. The management through MPAs is expected to limit failures caused by conventional management tools but it also increases the system complexity because countries that exploit fish stocks make face diverse interests. We model an area basedmanagement system that takes into account to biological, economic and social aspects of tropical tuna fisheries. We shall present and discuss features of a multi-fleets, multi-gears and multi-species bioeconomic model applied to Indian Ocean.

40|$|Research PaperHighly {{migratory fish}} {{stocks in the}} Western and Central Pacific Ocean are an {{important}} source of income for those Pacific island nations through whose economic zones the stocks pass, and for <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations that target the stocks. Although the tropical stocks have been regarded in the past as highly productive, many stocks are now under pressure. A Commission for the management and conservation of the stocks was established late in 2005, under the principles and guidelines laid down in the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. The Secretariat has listed a range of possible conservation and management measures, including: catch and effort reductions; fleet capacity limits; and area, gear and period closures, taking account of stocks classified as overfished by the relevant scientific committee. The paper considers the desirability of these and other measures, such as fees for access to economic zones, and marketable harvesting rights to fishing a stock anywhere within areas where stock levels are not threatened. Criteria include minimum target stock levels, sustainability, economic efficiency and equity. Problems discussed are: increased access fees leading to greater diversion of <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations’ effort to areas just outside economic zones; the extent of discriminatory pricing of harvesting rights systems needed for efficiency where the age distribution of stock, or across-stock interactions, differ spatially; and the likelihood of all interested parties agreeing to a management regime even if it could potentially benefit all parties.

40|$|The massive {{destruction}} of fish stocks during the last 100 years has created an enormous environmental problem with consequences that are poorly understood, both for the fish and for the human populations that depend upon them. Many think of the oceans as the ultimate commons, and believe that fish stocks collapsed because individual fishermen did not restrain their behavior. However, the collapse of world fisheries was not caused by individual fishermen rushing to harvest but {{was the result of}} conscious policies adopted by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations in general, and the U. S., in particular, to promote and expand global fisheries, not only for the fish, but for territorial reasons that were bound with foreign policy concerns during the Cold War. The <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations pushed for a policy of taking fish without restrictions, until critical biological points were estimated, then applying measures to slow or restrict the catch. The practical effect of this policy, known as Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) was that <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations <b>fished</b> unhindered until countries began expanding their territorial limits to 200 miles during the 1970 s. The policy greatly facilitated the rise of an industrial, global fishing system, creating fishing capacity that far exceeded the ability of stocks to reproduce. MSY was promoted as being grounded in conservation and sound science, but its adoption was greatly influenced by American foreign policy during this period. MSY also focused fisheries science on the narrow objective of determining harvest points, thus allowing the world’s <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations, including the U.

However, for migratory stocks, the offshore may serve as a natural marine reserve (i. e., a source) to the inshore (i. e., sink); hence these partnership agreements generate spatial externality. In this paper, we present a bioeconomic model in which a social planner uses a landing tax (ad valorem tax) to internalize this spatial externality.
