5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E

5|$|Although the Germans {{expected}} another Allied {{landing in}} the Mediterranean, the advancing Red Army and the Allied landings in Normandy placed great strains on German resources, so little was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the condition of Army Group G, which was occupying Southern France. Given the advancing Allied forces in northern France, the Germans deemed a realistic defense in the south impossible. Johannes Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern France in July and August with the German High Command, but the 20 July plot led to an atmosphere in which any withdrawal {{was out of the}} question. Blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces, any serious Allied landing attempt would be impossible to ward off. He planned a withdrawal in secret, to include demolition of the ports and proceeding in an orderly manner, covered by the 11th Panzer Division. He intended to establish a new defense line centered on Dijon in central France. German intelligence was aware of the impending Allied landing, and on 13August Blaskowitz ordered the 11th Panzer Division to move east of the Rhône River, where the landing was expected.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{was formed}} in 1920, {{but it was not}} until March 1921 that a number of former Austro-Hungarian vessels were transferred, some of which were already obsolete. The only modern {{seagoing}} warships transferred were twelve torpedo boats. Little was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the fleet during the 1920s, but fleet modernisation was underway from the early 1930s, with a British-made flotilla leader followed by a class of modern French-designed destroyers and German-built MTBs. Almost all of the fleet was captured by the Axis powers during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, but a few vessels escaped to form the KJRM-in-exile, which operated under British supervision. Later in the war, several vessels that had been in Italian service were returned to the KJRM-in-exile, and these were joined by a British corvette. At the end of the war, these vessels were transferred to the fledgling Yugoslav Navy.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutional}} {{party in}} the legislature desired toleration of the nonjuring clergy, {{the repeal of the}} laws against the relatives of the émigrés, and some merciful discrimination towards the émigrés themselves. The directors baffled all such endeavours. On the other hand, the socialist conspiracy of Babeuf was easily quelled. Little was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the finances, and the assignats continued to fall in value until each note was worth less than the paper it was printed on; debtors easily paid off their debts. A series of financial reforms started by the Directory finally took effect after it fell from power.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}} decided {{to concentrate on}} developing agriculture, while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality-control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid the good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on {{the country as a}} whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} pork {{producer}} odor {{survey conducted}} in 2002, {{respondents were asked to}} provide information on things they were <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> neighbor relations. The open-ended question provided a wide range of responses. It was evident that many producers are working with neighbors to better inform them about their pork production operation and when they may be doing activities such as applying manure, etc. Primary items producers are <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> neighbor relations are communication, treating them with respect, and considering weather before applying manure. This would include wind direction, air temperature, etc. Another grouping of items included manure application timing, providing pork/gifts, keeping facilities and landscaping looking nice, and facility location or siting. Producers <b>do</b> things <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> neighbor relations. About 30 percent indicated they check the weather before deciding to apply manure; and/or they communicate with the neighbors informing them when manure will be applied. Another one-in-six respondents indicated they use landscaping around the facility <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> its appearance...|$|R
