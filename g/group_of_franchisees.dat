40|$|Franchisees` often {{complain}} that franchisors {{do not meet}} their needs, and are generally viewed as being unhappy with their franchise agreements. The aim of the paper is to investigate the level <b>of</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>franchisees</b> {{with regard to the}} elements of individual franchise concepts, managed by the franchise agreement. Including details of the standard franchise agreement: terms of the contract, rights and obligations, training programs, operational support provided by the franchisor, products, pricing, promotions, distribution, and franchise fees. Data was collected by means of a self-administrated questionnaire that was sent to the selected population. The data represents two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> the same franchise, namely franchisees operating two years and less as franchisees and franchisees that operate longer than two years as franchisees and consider the extent to which selected contract elements are viewed differently. Findings indicate that both <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>franchisees</b> had a high level of satisfaction with the elements of the franchise contract with the exception of identified opportunities that could be developed in order to increase the <b>franchisees</b> level <b>of</b> satisfaction with the franchise agreement. In general, the franchisor also had a high level of marketing orientation. Further research is needed to ensure that the franchisor’s current product ranges will be more competitive if compared with other franchise concepts. The franchisor should attend to the improvement of product research, new product development, pricing strategies, packaging and product planning. Key words: Franchisee satisfaction, marketing-orientation, franchisee and franchisor, franchise agreement, franchise legislation. ...|$|R

The relationships in the model are expressed with three hypotheses, which were tested with data obtained from nine restaurant franchise companies and 127 <b>of</b> their <b>franchisee</b> owner-managers. The study findings demonstrate that while franchising does offer many of the benefits of independent small business ownership while reducing some of the problems, there are very real differences between satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory franchise systems, at least from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>franchisees...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Canada, Dunkin' Donuts and {{its market}} share {{have all but}} vanished. In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the chain began disappearing from all regions of Canada, with its last {{foothold}} {{in the province of}} Quebec. However its decline is most apparent in Quebec, where the chain once had 210 stores but by mid-2014 had only 4—the last franchisees in the country. Only one Canadian store has the facilities to make donuts fresh on site; the others are merely shopping-mall food-court stands, dependent on the delivery of baked goods. One of the main reasons for Dunkin' Donuts's decline was competition with Tim Hortons, similar to Tim Hortons' own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin' Donuts. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Dunkin' Donuts <b>franchisees</b> won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada.

The goal {{of this paper is}} to empirically examine (1) the relationship between <b>franchisee</b> perceptions <b>of</b> information quality (information dissemination and information search) and the confirmation <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> performance expectations, (2) <b>franchisee</b> characterizations <b>of</b> their relationships with their franchisors in terms of relational sentiments such as trust and relational satisfaction, communication and conflict management, (3) the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and perceived conflict, and (4) the moderating effect <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> experience on the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and <b>franchisee</b> perceptions <b>of</b> conflict. Empirical results, utilizing a sample <b>of</b> 345 <b>franchisees</b> in Australia, present strong evidence for the support of nine of the ten hypotheses drawn from the conceptual model.
