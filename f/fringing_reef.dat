5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
25|$|In 1842 in {{his first}} monograph, The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Charles Darwin set out his theory of the {{formation}} of atoll reefs, an idea he conceived during the voyage of the Beagle. He theorized uplift and subsidence of the Earth's crust under the oceans formed the atolls. Darwin’s theory sets out a sequence of three stages in atoll formation. It starts with a <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> forming around an extinct volcanic island as the island and ocean floor subsides. As the subsidence continues, the <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> becomes a barrier reef, and ultimately an atoll reef.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} equatorial, with little {{rainfall}} and intense sunshine. Temperatures are moderated somewhat by a constant {{wind from the}} east. The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a coral island surrounded by a narrow <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> with a slightly raised central area. The highest point is about six meters above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Many of the Great Barrier Reef's {{components}} are actually <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs.</b> Of the close to 3400 individual reefs, 760 are actually <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{it is hard}} to {{tell the}} {{difference}} between <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs</b> and another type of reef called a barrier reef. One of the ways that these two types of reefs are separated is based on the depth of the lagoon in the back reef which is the area near to shore. Barrier reefs have at least some deep portions; <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs</b> do not. Another major difference is that barrier reefs tend to be much farther away from shore than <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hanauma {{is both a}} Nature Preserve and a Marine Life Conservation District (the {{first of}} several {{established}} in the State of Hawaii). Reflecting changes in attitude, its name has changed over time from Hanauma Bay Beach Park to Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve. Visitors are {{required by law to}} refrain from mistreating marine animals or from touching, walking, or otherwise having contact with coral heads, which appear much like large rocks on the ocean floor (here, mostly seaward of the shallow <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> off the beach). It is always recommended to avoid contacting coral or marine rocks as cuts to the skin can result and neglecting such wounds may bring medical problems.|$|E
25|$|Thick forest once {{covered the}} eastern coastal plain, where the Amerindians built their first {{settlements}} during the Aceramic period, complimenting the ecosystem surrounding the coral reef just offshore. It was the {{easy access to}} fresh water {{on the island and}} the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians to settle this area around 600 BC. With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 percent of the large eastern <b>fringing</b> <b>reef</b> to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it in turn provided less protection for the coastline.|$|E
25|$|While a few {{offshore}} anchorage {{spots are}} marked on maps, Jarvis island has no ports or harbors, and swift currents are a hazard. There is a boat landing {{area in the}} middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon, and another near the southwest corner of the island. The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated, which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century. The island has a tropical desert climate, with high daytime temperatures, constant wind, and strong sun. Nights, however, are quite cool. The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet (7 meters) at its highest point. Because of the island's distance from other large landmasses, the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world. The low-lying coral island has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow <b>fringing</b> <b>reef.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Tubbataha Reef is {{situated}} on the Cagayan Ridge, composing of extinct underwater volcanoes. Being a true atoll structure, {{it is believed that}} the atolls of Tubbataha were formed thousands of years ago as <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs</b> and volcanic islands. This is based on Charles Darwin's theory that atolls are formed when a volcano erupts and afterwards an island is born. When the volcanoes became extinct and the islands subsided over a long time, only the corals remain, growing towards the sunlight. The very big corals seen today surrounding the lagoons are originally the <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the medium-term effects of sediment run-off caused by the construction of a coastal road through rainforested catchments in late 1984 on the coral communities of the Cape Tribulation <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs.</b> In the absence of any pre-construction baseline we relied on surveys of two similar control locations, north and south of the potential impact location adjacent to the new road catchment, to determine the significance of any changes that occurred. The southern control was adjacent to the long-established portion of the road south of Cape Tribulation and the northern control adjacent to a small undisturbed catchment A preliminary three-year study had suggested that the road construction had no effect of the <b>fringing</b> <b>reefs</b> of this region (Ayling and Ayling 1991).

The species composition and dominant species of each zone reflect the environmental conditions.
