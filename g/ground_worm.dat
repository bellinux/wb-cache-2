40|$|Abstract. Collaborative environments {{present a}} happy hunting <b>ground</b> for <b>worms</b> due to {{inherent}} trust present amongst the peers. We present a novel control-theoretic approach {{to respond to}} zero-day worms in a sig-nature independent fashion in a collaborative environment. A federation of collaborating peers share information about anomalies to estimate {{the presence of a}} worm and each one of them independently chooses the most cost-optimal response from a given set of responses. This technique is de-signed to work when the presence of a worm is uncertain. It is unique in that the response is dynamic and self-regulating based on the current en-vironment conditions. Distributed Sequential Hypothesis Testing is used to estimate the extent of worm infection in the environment. Response is formulated as a Dynamic Programming problem with imperfect state information. We present a solution and evaluate it in the presence of an Internet worm attack for various costs of infections and response. A major contribution of this paper is analytically formalizing the problem of optimal and cost-effective response to worms. The second contribution is an adaptive response design that minimizes the variety of worms that can be successful. This drives the attacker towards kinds of worms that can be detected by other means; which in itself is a suc-cess. Counter-intutive results such as leaving oneself open to infections being the cheapest option in certain scenarios become apparent with our response model...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the tenets}} of the Special Theory of Relativity is that nothing may travel faster than light. Humans who dream of {{traveling}} between the stars face the reality that any such trip would require many years to complete. Even if a means of travel at near {{the speed of light}} could be achieved, there would be resulting time dilation effects. These difficulties have convinced some that interstellar travel is unrealistic; others are not so easily dissuaded. First postulated by Einstein, passageways known as wormholes might be used to conduct humanity on its voyages to the stars. This paper will explore the properties of wormholes and how they may, or may not, provide a means for travel in space and in time. Wormholes Predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, a wormhole is a tunnel in space and time. In theory, by entering a wormhole one could travel vast distance in a very short time. As an example, an examination of the apocryphal apple that hit Newton on the head will suffice. As the apple lay on the <b>ground,</b> two <b>worms</b> find it. They agree, as only worms can, to race to the other side. The first worm, Slinky, travels around the outside of the apple to a point on the other side. The second worm, Inchy, takes a path through the apple, a wormhole. If Inchy’s wormhole is straight and true, Inchy should arrive before Slinky. Inchy takes a shortcut, {{in much the same way}} a wormhole may represent not only a shortcut through space, but also perhaps a shortcut through time...|$|R

"A sudden shriek {{would wake}} up the harassed {{soldiers}} and they would see {{in the glow of}} embers one of themselves writhe on the <b>ground</b> like a <b>worm</b> trodden on by an invisible foot. And before the dawn broke he would be stiff and cold. Parties so visited have been known to rise like one man, abandon the fire and run off into the night in mute panic. Or a comrade talking to you on the march would stammer suddenly {{in the middle of a}} sentence, roll affrighted eyes, and fall down with distorted face and blue lips, breaking the ranks with the convulsions of his agony. Men were struck in the saddle, on sentry duty, in the firing line, carrying orders, serving the guns. I have been told that in a battalion forming under fire with perfect steadiness for the assault of a village, three cases occurred within five minutes at the head of the column; and the attack could not be delivered because the leading companies scattered all over the fields like chaff before the wind.|$|R
40|$|Trustee, Sahishnatha Trust who {{conducted}} these initiatives. The authors are thankful to Ms. V. Vidya for the statistical support. A child’s life {{centers around the}} home, school and community. These places should be healthy places where they can thrive, protected from diseases, but in reality these are most often the unhealthiest of places. This is primarily responsible {{for the majority of}} the deaths and the disease burden among children of the developing world. Every year more than 5 million children die due to diseases linked to the poor conditions of the environments in which they live, learn and play – in other words their homes, schools and their community. Degraded environments are the breeding <b>grounds</b> for germs, <b>worms</b> and disease bearing insects. Diseases such as malaria, schistosomasis, dengue fever and cholera debilitate half a billion children every year. Many environmental risks to children’s health are aggravated by persistent poverty, conflicts, and natural and man made disaster and the prevailing conditions of social inequity. These have detrimental effect on the child’s growth and development. The development of the child starts inside the uterus of the mother and advers...|$|R
40|$|The corn crop {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops of the state, and will doubtless remain so for many years to come. It is, therefore, of importance to know something of its insect enemies and the method of treating them. From the nature of the injuries to corn, particularly on account of the difficulty of any direct examination of some forms, and the difficulty of making any exact estimate, their injuries are, I think, very generally under-estimated. Probably the most serious losses come from those working under ground, the injuries of which are to be found simply in the lessened crop, and which consequently pass unnoticed by most farmers. At times the destruction of seed in the <b>ground</b> by wire <b>worms,</b> or injury to the newly sprouted plants by cut worms, wire worms or sod worms, which necessitate replanting, attract general attention. Sometimes, also, the general destruction of the crop by the corn root worm is noted, but when any or all of these insects simply destroy undeveloped plants or parts of plants, or when there is a gradual drain upon the growth of the plant, as occurs from the presence of the root lice in corn fields, it is naturally unnoticed, and the shortage in the crops is. charged to other agents...|$|R
40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a tilted head cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted head cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted head cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the head cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or <b>ground.</b> A <b>worm</b> to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a tilted head cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted head cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{goes down}} to {{the lower levels of}} the plant, where he finds what he has been seeking, Genghis Khan's treasure. Patrick shows up, gun drawn, while his {{associate}} has Alicia at knife point. Daniel has to put his gun down. He distracts Patrick by pointing out Bixler's remains and they get into a wrestling match. Daniel shoots Patrick in the shoulder. The <b>ground</b> shakes and <b>worms</b> begin to emerge from the walls. Patrick's henchman is eaten, and Daniel realizes that this is the queen worm's nest and that the entire place must be destroyed. Timur arrives at the plant to find Daniel and Alicia and discovers Bana's body outside. Daniel discovers the room full of crates holding the treasure from the tomb. He breaks open a crate and artifacts and gold pour out onto the floor. Alicia reminds him that it isn't worth dying for, and he agrees that they must destroy the plant completely. Patrick limps into view, bleeding badly. Timur appears with shotgun in hand. Behind him the queen creeps up and eats Patrick. Daniel and Alicia attempt to make the pressure build up in the generators and pipes. Just as they are about to escape from the building, more worms show up. Timur shoots them, but is eaten by the queen. Daniel and Alicia rush outside as the explosions go off. Daniel returns Alicia to Sepegal and her colleagues. He says he is going back to collect the treasure from the field around the plant, and drives away.|$|R
60|$|Earth-worms must be {{considered}} as terrestrial animals, though they are still in one sense semi-aquatic, like {{the other members of}} the great class of annelids to which they belong. M. Perrier found that their exposure to the dry air of a room for only a single night was fatal to them. On the other hand he kept several large worms alive for nearly four months, completely submerged in water. {10} During the summer when the ground is dry, they penetrate to a considerable depth and cease to work, as they do during the winter when the <b>ground</b> is frozen. <b>Worms</b> are nocturnal in their habits, and at night may be seen crawling about in large numbers, but usually with their tails still inserted in their burrows. By the expansion of this part of their bodies, and with the help of the short, slightly reflexed bristles, with which their bodies are armed, they hold so fast that they can seldom be dragged out of the ground without being torn into pieces. {11} During the day they remain in their burrows, except at the pairing season, when those which inhabit adjoining burrows expose the greater part of their bodies for an hour or two in the early morning. Sick individuals, which are generally affected by the parasitic larvae of a fly, must also be excepted, as they wander about during the day and die on the surface. After heavy rain succeeding dry weather, an astonishing number of dead worms may sometimes be seen lying on the ground. Mr. Galton informs me that on one such occasion (March, 1881), the dead worms averaged one for every two and a half paces in length on a walk in Hyde Park, four paces in width. He counted no less than 45 dead worms in one place in a length of sixteen paces. From the facts above given, it is not probable that these worms could have been drowned, and if they had been drowned they would have perished in their burrows. I believe that they were already sick, and that their deaths were merely hastened by the ground being flooded.|$|R
