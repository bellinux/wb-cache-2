5000|$|He {{bought the}} rights to use an Ashley body on a Leslie Ballamy chassis.

The engine was a Ford 1703 cc. Reliant was authorized to deliver the first 100 cars to the United States market.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 1930s until the mid-1950s Harrington {{employee}} and former Southdown driver Ernie Johnstone constructed 63 quarter-scale road-legal coaches to give novelty rides to young children.

50|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the HP-18's heyday, Schreder also {{spent a great}} deal of time attempting to develop a lightweight jet engine for small aircraft. Schreder envisioned such a powerplant as being ideal for self-launcing sailplanes. His first attempts featured pulsejet <b>engines</b> with their <b>bodies</b> contained within the blades of a propeller, and exhausting through nozzles deflected 90 degrees so as to cause the propeller to spin. Though some success was attained, Schreder found difficulty in containing the internal pressures so as to prevent the <b>engine</b> <b>bodies</b> from reverting to round cross-section. Also, these engines were quite loud and not very fuel-efficient.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{gasoline}} {{crisis of the}} 1970s, many American automakers began offering no-frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the Ford Pinto MPG, and Plymouth Duster [...] "Feather Duster"). As before, these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering); fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (e.g., no cigarette lighter); lighter-weight components (such as aluminum on various <b>engine,</b> <b>body</b> and suspension components); and a manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|The Big Boys are {{articulated}} {{like the}} Mallet locomotive design, though without compounding. They {{were designed for}} stability at 80 mph. They were built with a wide margin of reliability and safety, as they normally operated well below that speed in freight service. Peak horsepower was reached at about 35 mph; optimal tractive effort, at about 10 mph. The locomotive without the tender was the longest <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> of any reciprocating steam locomotive in the world.|$|E

New buses were being produced parallelly with Jelcz PR110's, and till 1986 even with Jelcz 043. In 1990 production of M11 has been finished; about 2600 buses had been produced.|$|E
50|$|A common {{conceptual}} {{error is}} to mistake {{a part of}} relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles {{and it would be}} appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an <b>engine</b> and <b>body,</b> but it would not be appropriate to model <b>engine</b> or <b>body</b> as a subclass of car.|$|R

50|$|During this phase, too, {{there is}} a {{difference}} in action between the very different masses in the intake and tailpipe. The intake air mass is again fairly low, but it now almost totally consists of outside air; therefore, fresh air is available almost immediately to begin re-filling the combustion zone from the front. The tailpipe air mass is also pulled, eventually reversing direction as well. The tailpipe will never be completely purged of hot combustion gases, but at reversal it will be easily able to pull in fresh air from all sides around the tailpipe opening, so its contained mass will be gradually increasing until the next deflagration event. As air flows rapidly into the combustion zone, the rarefaction wave is reflected rearward by the front of the <b>engine</b> <b>body,</b> and as it moves rearward the air density in the combustion zone naturally rises until the pressure of the air/fuel mixture reaches a value where deflagration can again commence.|$|E

50|$|Models were {{attractive}} and well-done {{but this was}} when larger scales were just becoming (along with Polistil) popular as toys for easier rending of details - yet before collector and consumer demand for near perfect rendition occurred through the 1990s (Sinclair's 1976). So, some of the Martoys line simply did not look right. The frames on the opening doors of the FIAT 127 were thick, unrefined and appeared toy-like. The BMW 3.0 CS simply could not capture the delicate fender curves of the real car and grille proportions were squarish. The subtle lines that defined {{the beauty of the}} real machine that Alexander Calder went on to decorate were lost on the Martoys model. The Porsche 911 was very nicely done, both in <b>engine,</b> <b>body,</b> lights and script and logo detail. With a little bit of trim paint the model was stunning (Sinclair's 1976). Nevertheless, the Porsche's roof line and rear quarters do not appear perfectly captured.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{back on the}} 400E series {{today it}} can be seen as an {{important}} link in the chain of Ford van models that have appeared over the years. Compared with the old E83W it represented a massive step forward, notably in its <b>engine,</b> <b>body,</b> gear change, suspension and capacity. It was also an important go between, for it must have provided its designers with a new concept upon which to improve, and improve they did as we shall see when looking at its successor. Unlike the smaller vans, the 400E series changed very little in its lifetime, which was understandable as there was no direct association with a passenger car variant which required constant facelifting to satisfy the car buying public. The range started and finished much the same, although as it went on it gathered more body styles, even the early 8 seater estate car returning {{in the last few years}} of its existence. For deliveries it was most useful, especially with the nearside door to get at the load; also, it was so easy to slip over the offside wheelarch down to the ground in one step when making your exit from the cab.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the XT {{was built}} in 600 {{different}} variants which, however, usually only look different. The most important change of the XT 600 which had only been using a kick starter was in 1990; the 600 E XT was presented as a new model with a more contemporary design, chrome-plated steel wheel instead of aluminum wheels, now without a tachometer, with the exhaust as the supporting frame member, a 13.9-liter tank and an electric starter. In addition, the oil tank, which was previously located under the left side cover, was moved forward behind the steering head between the frame and girder bridge. Due to high demand, the XT 600 K, which featured a kick starter, but was otherwise structurally identical to the XT 600 E model, {{was introduced to the}} market; the series ran until 1995. Due to more stringent emissions requirements, the power of the XT 600 E, which had become the only available model, was reduced by 4 kW to , and a tachometer was reintegrated in the cockpit. The clutch actuation on the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> was moved from the left to the right side, and the muffler was no longer part of the rear frame. The reliability of the XT unit was not harmed, as mileages of over 100,000 km and unopened motor are not uncommon.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of fire apparatus by Crown Coach {{can be traced}} back to World War II. As was the case with other vehicle manufacturers, all production was diverted towards the armed forces following the outbreak of the war. In the case of Crown Coach, the company was asked to produce fire <b>engine</b> <b>bodies</b> for a chassis produced by Ford/Marmon-Herrington. In the postwar era, though Crown Coach concentrated its resources on updating its bus products (on what would become the 1949 Crown Supercoach school bus), the company built a few more chassis-based fire engines in the late 1940s.|$|R
40|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine cooling assembly 20 comprises a primary and secondary flow of coolant. The secondary flow of coolant is injected e. g as a jet into the primary flow of coolant in dependence upon a variable provided by a sensor 32 A, 32 D such as a temperature sensor, which provides {{an indication of the}} temperature of the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> in the region 24 where the secondary flow of coolant mixes with the primary flow of coolant. The secondary flow of coolant may be a pulsed flow having a frequency 0. 2 to 50 Hz. The invention provides controlled cooling at different and variable levels in one or more localised regions of the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> such as cylinder heads. The injected jet is believed to create turbulence in the coolant flow which enhances heat transfer between the coolant and the engine. The invention leads to reduced fuel consumption and reduces engine emissions.; There is also disclosed a method of cooling an {{internal combustion}} engine. In a further embodiment the invention comprises an {{internal combustion engine}} which includes passageways in the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> 20...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the mass ratio of S 1110 diesel engine, {{structural}} intensity and stiffness analysis are performed on the assembly parts of <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> by using the finite element method. Through comparative analysis of more than one calculation scheme, optimization scheme has been got. To ensure the intensity and stiffness of the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> is not reduced under the premise, optimization scheme makes the body mass greatly reduced from the original engine body’s 38 kg to 13. 8 kg and the engine mass ratio is reduced from 13. 2 kg/kW to 11. 81 kg/kW. The results show that, changing the body material from cast iron materials to cast aluminum materials, the body stress distribution trends are similar, but the cast aluminum body deformation increases; increasing the number of cylinder head bolts to 6 can reduce the deformation of the cylinder liner; a reasonable set of stiffeners can reduce the bearing bore deformation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} displacement of a crankshaft axis caused by temperature of marine, slow-speed main engine. Information of thermal displacement {{of a power}} transmission system axis is significant during a shaft line alignment and a crankshaft springing analysis. Warmed-up main engine {{is a source of}} deformations of an <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> as well as a ship hull in the area of an engine room and hence axis of a crankshaft and a shaftline. Engines 2 ̆ 7 producers recommend the model of parallel displacement of the crankshaft axis under the influence of an engine heat. The model gives us the value (one number!) of the crankshaft axis displacement in the hot propulsion system 2 ̆ 7 s condition. This model may be too simple in some cases. Presented numerical analyses are based on temperature measurements of the main <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> and the ship hull during a sea voyage. The paper presents computations of MAN B&W K 98 MC type engine (power: 40000 kW, revolutions: 94 rpm) mounted on 4500 TEU container ship (length: 290 m). Propulsion system is working in nominal, steady-state conditions; it is the basic assumption during the analyses. Numerical analyses were preformed with usage of Nastran software based on Finite Element Method. The FEM model of the <b>engine</b> <b>body</b> comprised over 800 thousand degree of freedom. Stiffness of the ship hull (mainly double bottom) with the foundation was modelled by a simple cuboid.
