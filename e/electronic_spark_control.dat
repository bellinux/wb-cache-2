In response to the recent 1979 energy crisis, the 1981 rework featured several fuel saving techniques {{to help make the}} Rounded-Line C/K-Series pickups more fuel efficient. Again, engineers turned to wind tunnels to resculpt the front end with new sheet metal, reducing areas which could hinder air flow and cause drag. A sleeker front bow-like look emerged, similar to a ship's bow with the front end being gently swept back from the center. New dual tier halogen headlamps became available with the Deluxe Front Appearance package. Mechanical updates included more anti-corrosion techniques, reduced weight, and a new 5.0 L 305 cubic inch V-8 with <b>electronic</b> <b>spark</b> <b>control.</b> The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 was offered in California in place of the new 5.0 L 305 engine with <b>electronic</b> <b>spark</b> <b>control,</b> which did not meet California's emissions requirements.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce fuel cost and CO 2 emissions, modern spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines need to lower {{as much as possible}} fuel consumption. A crucial factor for efficiency improvement is represented by the combustion phase, which in an SI engine is controlled acting on the spark advance. This fundamental engine parameter is currently controlled in an open-loop by means of maps stored in the electronic control unit (ECU) memory: such kind of control, however, does not allow running the engine always at its best performance, since optimal combustion phase depends on many variables, like ambient conditions, fuel quality, engine aging, and wear, etc. A better choice would be represented by a closed-loop <b>spark</b> timing <b>control,</b> which may be pursued by means of combustion phase indicators, i. e., parameters mostly derived from in-cylinder pressure analysis that assume fixed reference values when the combustion phase is optimal. As documented in literature, the use of combustion phase indicators allows the determination of the best spark advance, apart from any variable or boundary condition. The implementation of a feedback <b>spark</b> timing <b>control,</b> based on the use of these combustion phase indicators, would ensure the minimum fuel consumption in every possible condition. Despite the presence of many literature references on the use combustion phase indicators, {{there is no evidence of}} any experimental comparison on the performance obtainable, in terms of both control accuracy and transient response, by the use of such indicators in a <b>spark</b> timing feedback <b>control.</b> The author, hence, carried out a proper experimental campaign comparing the performances of a proportional-integral <b>spark</b> timing <b>control</b> based on the use of five different in-cylinder pressure derived indicators. The experiments were carried out on a bench test, equipped with a series production four cylinder spark ignition engine and an eddy current dynamometer, using two data acquisition (DAQ) systems for data acquisition and <b>spark</b> timing <b>control.</b> Pressure sampling was performed by means of a flush mounted piezoelectric pressure transducer with the resolution of one crank angle degree. The feedback control was compared to the conventional map based control in terms of response time, control stability, and control accuracy in three different kinds of tests: steady-state, step response, and transient operation. All the combustion phase indicators proved to be suitable for proportionalintegral feedback <b>spark</b> advance <b>control,</b> allowing fast and reliable control even in transient operations.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{considerations}} in designing intrinsically safe electronics devices: reducing or eliminating internal <b>sparking,</b> <b>controlling</b> component temperatures, and eliminating component spacing {{that would allow}} dust to short a circuit. Elimination of spark potential within components is accomplished by limiting the available energy in any given circuit and {{the system as a}} whole. Temperature, under certain fault conditions such as an internal short in a semiconductor device, becomes an issue as the temperature of a component can rise to a level that can ignite some explosive gasses, even in normal use. Safeguards, such as current limiting by resistors and fuses, must be employed to ensure that in no circumstance can a component reach a temperature that could cause autoignition of a combustible atmosphere. In the highly compact electronic devices used today PCB's often have component spacing that create the possibility of an arc between components if dust or other particulate matter works into the circuitry, thus component spacing, siting and isolation become important to the design.|$|R
