40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} {{a theory of}} aid as trade. I assume that aid is a payment for an <b>invisible</b> <b>export</b> of strategic services to a large donor country seeking diplomatic goodwill and exclusive strategic use of a small country's territory, oceanic space and airspace. In a formal two countries-two goods model, the strategic service is produced with a higher productivity in the small country/island because of its geographic location (close to a potential enemy of the large country, for example). The other good is a composite manufactured good produced with higher productivity in the large country. There are gains from international trade that {{can be obtained by}} both countries, and divided between them. The citizen of both countries are better off: a lower cost for defense of the large industrial country, and a geostrategic rent for the citizen of the small country, enabling them to finance a deficit of the official balance of goods and services...|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{has been}} an {{important}} South Korean export industry since the early 1960s and remains a critical source of foreign currency and <b>invisible</b> <b>export</b> earnings. By 1981 overseas construction projects, most of them in the Middle East, accounted for 60 percent of the work undertaken by South Korean construction companies. Contracts that year were valued at US$13.7 billion. In 1988, however, overseas construction contracts totaled only US$2.6 billion (orders from the Middle East were US$1.2 billion), a 1 percent increase over the previous year, while new orders for domestic construction projects totaled US$13.8 billion, an 8.8 percent increase over 1987. [...] South Korean construction companies therefore concentrated on the rapidly growing domestic market in the late 1980s. By 1989 there were signs of a revival of the overseas construction market: the Dong Ah Construction Company signed a US$5.3 billion contract with Libya to build the second phase (and other subsequent phases) of Libya's Great Man-Made River Project, with a projected cost of US$27 billion when all 5 phases were completed. South Korean construction companies signed over US$7 billion of overseas contracts in 1989. Korea's largest construction companies include Samsung C&T Corporation, which built some of the highest building's and most noteworthy skyscrapers such as three consecutively world's tallest buildings: Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, and Burj Khalifa.|$|R

50|$|In 1997, the Conservative {{government}} committed {{itself to}} replacing the Royal Yacht if re-elected, while the Labour Party refused to disclose its plans for the vessel. After Labour won the general election in May 1997, it announced the vessel was to be retired and no replacement would be built. The previous government had argued that the cost was justified by its role in foreign policy and promoting British interests abroad, particularly through conferences held by British Invisibles, formerly the Committee on <b>Invisible</b> <b>Exports.</b>|$|E
50|$|British Invisibles itself {{originated}} in the Committee on <b>Invisible</b> <b>Exports,</b> set up in April 1968 by the Bank of England and then became the British <b>Invisible</b> <b>Exports</b> Council. It was largely the idea of Cyril Kleinwort who realised {{that the government was}} paying much attention to the UK's balance of trade in goods, but little to the UK's invisible earnings from services. In 1984 Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick had become Chairman of the organisation by which time invisible earnings were accounting for a third of the UK's earnings. He stayed until 1991. On 19 October 1990 the organisation (registered as a company) became British Invisibles. In January 1998 it merged with CEENET, a company set up by the Corporation of London to promote financial services to Eastern Europe, and re-branded itself as BI. It acquired a new Chief Executive, Jeremy Seddon, and a new Deputy Chief Executive, Henrietta Royle. Charlie Haswell joined the executive team, and later the Board, on secondment from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop links with British Embassies and High Commissions around the world. The company was a membership organisation and focused on running promotional events abroad for its members (primarily in the emerging markets), undertaking research on the performance of the financial services industry and providing the secretariat for financial services lobbying in the WTO. BI became known as IFSL on 1 February 2001. Invisibles historically have consisted of services (financial and legal), investment income and transfers. The organisation has in the past published The City Table, giving the order of financial services companies.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{fraternity}} {{and how to}} organise {{it was one of}} 19th-century Europe's <b>invisible</b> <b>exports</b> to the New World. Fitzpatrick (2005) {{explores the}} international diffusion of the Loyal Orange Institution, with comparative reference to Freemasonry, its main model. Three alternative explanations are discussed for its appeal outside Ireland: that it facilitated the assimilation of emigrants, transmitted 'tribal' Irish animosities to fresh contexts, or adapted itself to preexisting sectarian rivalries abroad. These hypotheses are tested using evidence from South Australia, where Orangeism flourished in the absence of heavy Ulster Protestant immigration. A collective profile of Orange South Australia is derived from lodge records showing age, religious denomination, and occupation, and the appeal of Orangeism is related to local political and religious contexts. In this case, Orangeism was primarily an export of organisational techniques rather than Irish personnel or bigotry.|$|E
50|$|Like the United Kingdom, France had {{initially}} struggled {{to recover from}} the devastation of World War I, trying without much success to recover war reparations from Germany. Unlike Britain, though, France had a more self-sufficient economy. In 1929, France seemed an island of prosperity, for three reasons. First, it was a country traditionally wary of trusts and big companies. The economy of France was above all founded in small and medium-sized businesses not financed by shares. Unlike the English-speaking world and particularly Americans, the French invested little on the stock exchange and put their confidence into gold, which in the crisis of 1929 was a currency of refuge. Gold had played the same role in the first world war, which explained French attachment to it. Finally, France had had a positive balance of payments for some years thanks mainly to <b>invisible</b> <b>exports</b> such as tourism. French investments abroad were numerous.|$|E
50|$|On {{the defeat}} of the Heath {{government}} in 1974, he became President of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce (now the British Chambers of Commerce, the BCC) in succession to Sir Robin Brooke. In that capacity Pat Limerick led the transformation of the ABCC and raised it to a level of national influence at which it was effectively competing with, and sometimes eclipsing, the much younger Confederation of British Industry. At the time the two organisations occupied the same building in Tothill Street / Dean Farrar Street in Westminster. In its original form, the ABCC, often known as 'The 'Parliament of Commerce', dated back to 1860. After his three-year term of office with the Chambers of Commerce was completed, Lord Limerick then became Chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board 1979-1983, as well as being Chairman of the British <b>Invisible</b> <b>Exports</b> Council from 1975 to 1991. He was chairman of the European-Atlantic Group from 1999 to 2001.|$|E

40|$|Bertram and Watters {{defined the}} mirab model (Migration, Remittances, Aid, and Bureaucracy) as a {{development}} process where remittances and foreign aid {{are the main}} resources of small island economies. Bertram suggested {{that it is a}} perfectly “sustainable” development strategy, as long as the “rent” from remittances and international aid continues. But there is a great reluctance on the part of officials and economists to accept the model as valid and sustainable. To them, it does not seem right to live off international aid and migrant remittances. A favorable case can be made for mirab. Pacific Island peoples and governments should not feel guilty about accepting aid and remittances, because such “external resources” may be seen as representing revenues from <b>invisible</b> <b>exports</b> to industrialized countries. By exporting labor and geostrategic services, small Pacific Island states make the best use of the only comparative advantage they may have in international trade. Donor countries and migrant host countries also gain from this arrangement. In this paper, I look at reasons why some people hate mirab, then show why everyone should love mirab...|$|E
40|$|Exporting {{is vital}} for both {{companies}} and a country. In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) data indicates that 135. 2 billion of visible exports and 122. 8 billion of <b>invisible</b> <b>exports</b> were earned in 1994 (see Central Statistics Office data for more details). The government spent nearly 200 {{million in the same}} period for the Overseas Trade Services export promotion. Unfortunately, a large gap exists in the academic literature concerning ways to evaluate export promotion policies and communication. This study addresses this issue and reports on an investigation which has been undertaken to evaluate ways in which government export assistance is promoted to companies and to concentrate on the methods of communication of these services. The proposed methodological approach that was used to undertake this research was in three stages. First, in the desk research stage, information was gathered on existing evaluation procedures. Co-operation had already been obtained from the Joint Directorate of Overseas Trade Services, involving access to certain internal reports. Second, empirical data were collected from a sample of UK companies to determine managers' perceptions towards the effectiveness of government export advertising, whether firms' assistance requirements were being met, and if they were being communicated with effectively. Third, interviews were carried out to obtain opinions from managers in order to add a qualitative dimension to the statistics generated from the postal survey. The findings indicate that the government's advertising of export assistance has not been effective. Conclusions are provided for policy makers together with recommendations for researchers to build on this study...|$|E
40|$|An AHRC funded project titled: Picturing ideas? Visualising and Synthesising Ideas as art (2009 - 10). Outputs including: 4 exhibitions; 4 publications; 3 papers; 2 largescale backlit digital prints; 1 {{commissioned}} print. (See Additional Information) [...] ABSTRACT: Utilising the virtuality {{of digital}} imagery this practice-led project explored {{the possibility of}} the cross-articulation between text and image and the bridging or synthesising potential of the visual affect of ideas. A series of digital images were produced 'picturing' or 'visualising' philosophical ideas derived from the writings of the philosopher Giles Deleuze, as remodellings of pre-existing philosophical ideas; developed through dialogues and consultation with specialists in the fields from which the ideas were drawn (philosophy, psychology, film) as well as artists and theorists concerned with ideas of 'mental imagery' and visualisation. Final images were produced as a synthesis (or combination) of these visualisations and presented in the format of large scale, backlit digital prints at a series of prestigious international exhibitions (see details above). Evaluation took the form of a four page illustrated text in Frieze magazine (August 2009) and three papers delivered at University of Ulster, Goldsmiths College of Art and Loughborough University. The project also included the publication of a catalogue essay (EAST 09) and an illustrated poem (in the Dark Monarch publication). A print version of the image was commissioned by <b>Invisible</b> <b>Exports</b> Gallery, New York and subsequently exhibited in The Devos Art Museum, School of Art & Design at Northern Michigan University and in a publication edited by Cedar Lewisohn for Tate Publishing. The project was funded by an AHRC practice-led grant (17 K) and Arts Council of England award (1. 5 K). The outputs, including high profile, publicly accessible exhibitions, prestigious publications and conference papers ensured the dissemination of the research {{to a wide range of}} audiences, including scholars/researchers across the arts and humanities engaged in practice-based and interdisciplinary theoretical work (in particular in the fields of contemporary art and art theory and those working on the integration of art and theory/philosophy/psychology) but also the wider audience for contemporary art...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. The {{economic}} {{problem of}} Greece {{is basically the}} persistent imbalance between resources and population. Previous attempts to establish the Greek economy on a long-run, sound economic basis by developing the domestic resources of the country fell short of their objective. In the past, the rate of resources utilization through capital investment, technological improvements, and institutional changes has been inadequate to support the growing population at a rising scale of living. Furthermore, post-war population growth may dissipate the economic gains achieved by foreign aid and may lead again to a new economic relapse. In Chapter I a concept of demographic equilibrium is developed which substitutes for the natural subsistence of the Malthusian equilibrium the concept of conventional subsistence and takes into consideration the attitudinal aspects of the people {{with regard to the}} scale of living. The objective of economic development is accepted as the establishment of conditions of demographic equilibrium achieved by a rate of resources utilization higher than the rate of population increase that results in a rising scale of living in accordance with desired standards. The approach in this study is historical and statistical. The objective is to analyze the direction which economic progress has taken in the past and to observe to what extent previous attempts were successful or unsuccessful in altering the course of economic change under a continuously growing population. Present developments are better understood when they are observed through conclusions drawn from past experience. The importance of natural resources is emphasized in Chapter II. The belief held among geographers that Greece constitutes an integral part of a world region termed AEgeis, a region occupying the greatest part of the eastern Mediterranean basin, cannot be explained without the presence of limited domestic resources on the Greek peninsula. These limited resources forced the surplus population to colonize and contributed to an economic prosperity based principally on transport-commerce- service activities. In the long history of Greece, the economic prosperity of the Greek peninsula was externally conditioned, depending on the changing economic significance of the region. In Chapter III a statistical analysis is conducted concerning the extent and nature of Greece's dependence on foreign trade. The propensity to trade and the per capita trade of Greece are the highest in the world. Measurements reveal that most of the increase in trade was necessary for the support of a growing population at an almost stationary scale of living. The persisting imbalance between population and domestic resources is also evidenced by a chronic trade deficit. Increasing visible imports were not met by a corresponding increase in visible exports. The deficit was met by <b>invisible</b> <b>exports</b> and borrowing. Furthermore, the chronic trade deficit indicates that Greece has never passed the borrowing stage. A cyclical trade disequilibrium was superimposed on the secular trade deficit. Measurements show that both visible and invisible export receipts are relatively more elastic than import expenditures. The nature of Greece's trade dependence is further explained by the monocultural character of the economy and the fact that Greece is a small buyer and seller in world trade. Post-war foreign aid has contributed little in moderating this monocultural economy. Furthermore, World War II has created some unfavorable conditions for Greek trade. As the balance of payments is a limiting factor {{on the size of the}} investment program, high trade dependence seriously restricts the prospects for economic development, and the population factor assumes paramount importance. Further evidence of the persistent imbalance between resources and population is offered in Chapter IV. The Greek economy is investigated during the period of free migrations and trade (1828 - 1920). The population of Greece increased from 753, 000 to 5, 017, 000. About two-thirds of the increase came from territorial acquisitions. Excess birth rates and some net immigration account for the remainder. Economic conditions in the domestic economy remained practically stagnant. Limited land, a feudal-like land tenure, primitive methods in production, and lack of capital restricted employment opportunities in agriculture. Manufacturing was largely a household operation. Foreign capital, borrowed by the government on heavy terms, was mostly spent on unproductive undertakings and led the country into default. Close correlation was found between the increase in population and imports. Percentwise, visible exports declined, while emigrant remittances and shipping earnings rose in importance. Migratory movements were almost continuous, especially with Greeks settled along the Anatolian littoral. Extensive emigration, especially overseas, at the turn of the century was more than offset by repatriation and the influx of refugees, even before the compulsory exchange of minorities in the Balkans. It is most likely that the scale of living did not improve after the third default of the country in the 1890 's. This likelihood, together with the extensive overseas emigration, strongly suggests that conditions of demographic equilibrium were not established. The 1920 's witnessed a mass in-migration of refugees and the first inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. This is the subject of Chapter V. Population increased qy about 1, 450, 000 to approximately 6, 472, 000 in 1931. About 300 million 1947 - 49 U. S. dollars of foreign capital entered the country. Yet, this reconstruction scheme was not successful. The refugee settlement, the agrarian reform, and rising excess birth rates resulted in uneconomic parcelation of the land and small-scale subsistence farming. Extensive cultivation accounts for the largest part of the increase in agricultural production. The growing imbalance between capital-resources and population is evidenced by the increase in labor-absorbing lines of farm production. Despite progress, manufacturing fell short of taking care of the large urban underemployment. Furthermore, manufacturing exports comprised a very small fraction of total commodity exports. A balanced budget, a stabilized currency, and a restored monetary and credit mechanism were an economic bonanza. The depression of the 1930 's put an early end to this first scheme. Greece fell into default again. Per capita real income never reached pre-World War I levels during the 1920 's. Even with milder or no cyclical effects at all, it is problematic whether the Greek economy would be able to export an adequate surplus to meet foreign loan obligations, much less maintain a rising scale of living. Chapter VI deals with the policy for economic autarchy of the 1930 's, which constitutes the second inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. Total gross investments, mostly forced savings through bootstrap-like operations, are estimated at between 600 and 700 million 1947 - 49 dollars. Agriculture proper received first and most attention. The weighted index of agricultural production, 1928 : 100, averaged 211 in 1937 - 38. Despite the drive for intensive production, extensive cultivation accounts for most of the increase in output. The animal-vegetable ratio showed marked signs of declining. The gains in greater output were largely the result of high tariffs. An increase in industrial production was not followed by a corresponding increase in employment. During the 1930 's population increased by about 950, 000 to 7, 345, 000 in 1940 because of high excess births. Measurements estimate that Greece had a 1, 424, 000 "surplus" agricultural population. Most likely, per capita income did not reach pre-World War II levels. Deterioration of nutritional standards through a fall in the animal-vegetable ratio at the consumption level and inferior manufactured goods domestically produced behind high tariffs most probably have taken place. International accounts were balanced and employment opportunities increased, but the policy for economic autarchy fell short of establishing conditions of demographic equilibrium. The subject of Chapter VII concerns the third attempt toward economic adjustment through post-war foreign aid. Widespread destruction, guerrilla warfare, and political instability delayed economic recovery. Finally, by 1952 economic conditions were improved, and the first post-war stable government came into power. However, prospects for maintaining conditions of demographic equilibrium are not encouraging. From over 2 billion dollars of foreign aid, only about 450 raillion were invested in long-run developmental projects. The drastic cut in foreign aid for 1953 - 54 and the limited availability of capital from domestic and foreign sources emphasize again the importance of population. In the past, continuous population increase has underscored and aggravated the economic difficulties of Greece. Post-war vital statistics indicate that the population of Greece is increasing rapidly, from 10 to 12 per thousand annual rate on the 1951 population census of 7, 631, 000. Fertility decline depends on the slow process of demographic transition. Emigration on an adequate scale is neither easily attainable nor acceptable on general grounds. At the same time, a higher scale of living is not only socially desirable but regarded as a matter of social justice. The ensuing relative deprivation may result in widely spread social unrest with corresponding political and ideological implications. In the final chapter (VIII) a summary of the findings is made, together with the following concluding remarks: The present rate of resources utilization may prove to be inadequate to support the rapidly increasing post-war population at a rising scale of living. Even prospects brighter than those of the present with respect to availability of capital and the renewal of foreign aid for the continuation of the development program, or to the integration of Greece into a European economy do not justify the absence of attempts on the part of the government to control future population growth...|$|E
