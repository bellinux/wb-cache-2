5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeal</b> and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeal</b> and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{copyrights}} for Bambi, A Life in the Woods were inherited by Anna Wyler, Salten's daughter, who renewed them in 1954. After her death, Wyler's husband {{sold the}} rights to Twin Books, a publishing company which subsequently {{filed a lawsuit against}} Disney, claiming Disney owed it money for the continued licensing {{for the use of the}} book. Disney countered by claiming that Salten had published the story in 1923 without a copyright notice, thus it immediately entered into the public domain. Disney also argued that if the claimed 1923 publication date was accurate, then the copyright renewal filed in 1954 had been registered after the deadline and was thus invalid. The courts initially upheld Disney's view; however, in 1996, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) {{had asked}} on September 17, 2012 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{to place an}} {{emergency}} stay on the permanent injunction made by Judge Forrest on September 12, 2012 The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeal.</b> This request by the DOJ was granted on September 17, 2012 when a single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold on the district court judge's permanent injunction ruling made by judge Katherine Forrest on September 12, 2012. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order by which he granted the Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. Judge Lohier's order further said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. Lohier offered no explanation or rationale for the interim stay. The Lohier order basically a.) temporarily stayed Judge Forrest's 2012-09-12 ruling b.) puts the whole matter i.e. the permanent injunction on hold c.) allows enforcement of the blocked NDAA section pending appeal and d.) means that the interim stay will remain in effect until at least September 28, 2012 when a three judge panel of the Second Circuit {{is expected to begin}} addressing the issue of a longer-term stay(The September 28, 2012 hearing won't go over the merits of the case, but only deal with the U.S. government's motion to stay the permanent injunction throughout its appeal of the permanent injunction.).

The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeal.</b> The DOJ contended that Judge Katherine Forrest's ruling incorrectly interpreted the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Justice Department also said Forrest's decision not only invalidated the NDAA, but went further: rejecting the White House's long-standing interpretation of the President's and the military's authority to detain terror suspects. In a 42-page court filing, the government argued that [...] "the district court expressly invites actions for contempt sanctions if the military exercises detention authority in a manner inconsistent with the court's deeply flawed understanding {{of the scope of}} that authority" [...] and that [...] "the order [...] "threatens irreparable harm to national security and the public interest by injecting added burdens and dangerous confusion into the conduct of military operations abroad during an active armed conflict." ...|$|E
