5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943.

Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E

25|$|During the 2006 British Motor Show in London, Aston Martin Racing {{revealed}} a near stock {{version of the}} V8 Vantage that would compete in the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race. The car, {{now known as the}} V8 Vantage N24, was driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez, development engineer Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24‑hour race. The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> on public roads after the race. While essentially much like the existing coupé, the N24 had a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy. Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone Recaro drivers seat.|$|E

500|$|Nebe {{decided to}} try experimenting by murdering Soviet mental patients, first with {{explosives}} near Minsk, and then with automobile exhaust at Mogilev. The idea of using gas was partly inspired by an incident in Nebe's past. One night after a party, Nebe had <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> drunk, parked in his garage, and fallen asleep with the engine running, thus nearly dying of carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust fumes. To conduct the experiments, he ordered chemist Albert Widmann, {{a member of the}} criminal-technical institute of the RKPA, to come to Minsk with [...] of explosives and exhaust hoses. The next day Widmann, Nebe, and an explosives expert carried out their first experiment in prepared bunkers in the Minsk area. According to testimony presented at Widmann's postwar trial: ...|$|E

500|$|Rory Storm was {{the stage}} name of Alan Caldwell, born 7 January 1938, in Oakhill Park Estate, Stoneycroft, Liverpool to Violet (née Disley) and Ernest [...] "Ernie" [...] George W Caldwell. His {{father was a}} window cleaner by profession, and a {{part-time}} porter at the Broadgreen Hospital, often singing songs to patients. Storm had one sister, Iris Caldwell, who dated George Harrison when she was 12, and Paul McCartney, when she was 17. Iris later married Shane Fenton, later known as Alvin Stardust. Apart from music, Storm was interested in sports, particularly athletics; he ran for an amateur team in Liverpool called the Pembroke Harriers, and set the Pembroke Athletics and Cycle Club steeplechase record. Instead of being <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> after concerts in Liverpool, Storm preferred to run home.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an opening caption that reads [...] "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while {{covering}} herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When {{he is at the}} office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him and}} sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting <b>driven</b> <b>home</b> by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E
