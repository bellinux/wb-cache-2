5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference.

RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score <b>increase,</b> <b>or</b> allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation <b>increase,</b> <b>or</b> both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
5|$|Throne of Fire is {{an action}} {{strategy}} game. Set in the Burning Citadel, located {{around the rim}} of a volcano, the player assumes the role {{of one of the}} three princes of the recently deceased King Atherik: Alorn the Lion Prince, Cordrin the Sun Prince, and Karag the Wolf Prince. As one of the princes, the player can play against two computer players or a second player and a computer player, who play the role of the other two princes. Each prince and their men-at-arms must fight the other princes and their army to the death. The player must also fight against the King's Guard, the protectors of the Throne of Fire. Weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses can be found around the castle, along with magical objects that can <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease a character's strength.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and their scores are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to <b>increase</b> <b>or</b> decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E
