The previous text-based versions used different colors or text color inversions to indicate various markups, and (starting with version 5.0) used a graphic mode only for an uneditable print preview that used <b>generic</b> <b>fonts</b> rather than the actual fonts that appeared on the printed page.|$|R

There is also a Public Image Ltd. tribute album whose cover is designed in homage to the album cover style, titled Tribute.|$|R

The same year Klose filmed a video of herself being slapped hard in the face by a male friend. In 2007 Klose was awarded the Prometheus Visual Arts Award by Brisbane's Institute of Modern Art Director, Robert Leonard for her Film For My Nanna. In the video the artist walks around the streets of Melbourne wearing a white wedding dress, with a cardboard sign around her neck which reads [...] "Nanna I Am Still Alone!".|$|R

50|$|Fox {{is known}} for being the first network to show a scoring banner {{across the top of}} the screen with {{scrolling}} text during NASCAR telecasts. In previous years when ESPN, CBS, and others owned the broadcasting rights, scoring had been displayed in a box on the top left corner. Fox was also the first network to use the unique font/styling for each car number (such as Dale Earnhardt's number 3, Jeff Gordon's 24, the Petty 43) for their on-screen graphics, as opposed to a <b>generic</b> <b>font</b> (however the banner continued to lose just text). Other networks would adopt this innovation and is now commonplace for most American motorsport broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|Recognizing fonts {{has become}} an {{important}} task in document analysis, due to {{the increasing number of}} available digital documents in different fonts and emphases. A <b>generic</b> <b>font</b> recognition system independent of language, script and content is desirable for processing various types of documents. At the same time, categorizing calligraphy styles in handwritten manuscripts is important for paleographic analysis, but has not been studied sufficiently in the literature. We address the font recognition problem as analysis and categorization of textures. We extract features using complex wavelet transform and use support vector machines for classification. Extensive experimental evaluations on different datasets in four languages and comparisons with state-of-the-art studies show that our proposed method achieves higher recognition accuracy while being computationally simpler. Furthermore, on a new dataset generated from Ottoman manuscripts, we show that the proposed method can also be used for categorizing Ottoman calligraphy with high accuracy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London...|$|E
