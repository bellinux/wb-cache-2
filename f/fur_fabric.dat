40|$|Abstract – Much {{research}} has shown the positive health benefits of companion animals. Unfortunately these animals are not always available to patients due to allergies, risk of disease, or other reasons. Recently, this application domain has attracted attention of robotics researchers. The Huggable is {{a new type of}} robotic companion capable of active relational and affective touch-based interactions with a person. It features a high number of somatic sensors (electric field, temperature, and force) over the entire surface of the robot, underneath a soft silicone skin and <b>fur</b> <b>fabric</b> covering. This paper describes the design and early results in recognizing affective content of touch for this robot. Index Terms – “sensitive skin”, robotic companion, human robot interaction, “somatic alphabet”, tactile sensing, social affective touch I...|$|E
40|$|In an imaginative, poetic and performative text, {{the author}} will {{challenge}} the ‘snuff’ moment of fur’s production as {{integral to the}} sublime ecstasy of consumption of the chief fabric of desire. If one’s well-being is bound to absolute somatic and psychic pleasure, then fur’s material fetish - its tactile, visual and olfactory stimulation, coupled with its generous allowance for the fetish-purist’s idealized disavowal – offers precisely the heady mix of sex, sadism, seduction and sensuality that keeps fur both perennially attractive and ascendant in the fashion industry. This paper examines how fur worn on the body dynamically co-joins the fetishistic disavowing pleasure of its rich surface with the overt deliberateness of suffering at its point of production, arguing that <b>fur</b> <b>fabric</b> manages to perform this oscillation between the disclaimer of the fur fetishist and the de-fetishized knowingness of the fur sadist, corrupting both in its insinuation that the deep and complex perversion of Western fur appreciation lies in the fetishist’s obverse acceptance of the ‘attraction of repulsion’, the oftentimes inversion of the traditional male fetishist in the legions of fur-wearing femme fatales, and the Sapphic implications of such femmes’ somatic insertion into the fur that still is inflected as female genitalia. Underpinning the paper’s concern with the ecstatic pleasure of the stroke of soft pelt passing across skin, the paper questions the how knowing acceptance of agony, disavowing desire for the sex-death nexus, critical subordination of emotion and empathy informs the fashioning of a certain form of well-being while peeling the skin off another...|$|E

His demands were so burdensome that some people were forced to negotiate with other pueblos to get the cotton needed in order to manufacture the fabrics required. Workers were paid a very low wage.

To relate vection strength with low-level visual features and with subjective impression of materials, we analyzed spatial frequency and participants’ ratings of adjective pairs that describe impressions of material categories. Although the nine material categories were perceived differently, there was no main effect of material condition on vection strength. However, multiple regression analyses revealed that vection was partially explained by both spatial frequency and principal components extracted from the subjective impression.

Alexander wanted to add that if she wished so herself, Helena could convert, but Ivan III adamantly rejected the amendment. Ivan III left Helena with detailed instructions on how to behave, who to invite for lunch, where to pray (she was prohibited from visiting Catholic churches). Ivan III also requested that Alexander would build an Orthodox church in Vilnius Castle Complex. In January 1495, Helena, accompanied by eighty nobles and servants, departed Moscow towards Vilnius. She reached Vilnius on February 15, 1495, and the same day the couple was married. The marriage ceremony was a complex combination of Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Helena prayed and prepared in the Cathedral of the Theotokos before moving to Vilnius Cathedral. She was dressed in a traditional Russian wedding dress. The wedding ceremony was officiated by Catholic Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius, and Orthodox Foma, priest who accompanied Helena from Moscow. Reportedly Helena did not bring much dowry (jewelry, three icons, silver and gilded dishes, expensive <b>fabrics,</b> <b>furs,</b> a carriage with horses) and Alexander did not gift her with lands after the wedding (he did so only in August 1501).|$|R

40|$|The {{buildings}} of the Great Wardrobe are identifiable on the Agas map of 1561 - 70. They were located within the ward of Baynard's Castle and the parish of St Andrew's by the castle. The plot fronted onto Carter Lane, to the north, St Andrew's to the south, Puddle Dock hill {{to the west and}} Addle Hill to the east. The Great Wardrobe was attached to the royal household and a substantial number of the accounts and warrants subsidiary to the accounts have survived. Most of the accounts are in Latin but by Henry VII’s reign, the first accounts in English appear. The format of the accounts also changed under the first Tudor as the clerks started to record information about who received livery by the name of the recipient rather than listing the suppliers of cloth and furs. The early history of the Great Wardrobe was presented by T. F. Tout in the fourth volume of his definitive work Chapters in the Administrative History of Medieval England, (Manchester, 1928). Tout noted that the fourteenth century Great Wardrobe had five key functions: acquiring raw materials, converting the <b>fabric</b> and <b>fur</b> into clothes, storing of raw materials, distributing the completed garments and accounting for the money received and spent by the keeper. Much less has been written on the Great Wardrobe under the first two Tudor king’s and this volume will demonstrate that the basic function of the Great Wardrobe in the sixteenth century remained unchanged. However, the book will also offer far more. The Great Wardrobe employed a range of craftsmen who lived and worked in the city. The holders of the key posts, such as the king’s tailor and the king’s skinner, were often leading members of their respective livery companies and they were at the centre of a network of other tailors, embroiderers, skinners and tapestry weavers who were employed on a more adhoc basis. The accounts will be used to explore the range of garments were available in Tudor London and the spectrum of techniques that the king’s artificers used to create clothes for the king and his household. They record the charges made for making different garments. The accounts also make it clear that while bespoke clothes were the norm for the king, some ready-made items such as footwear, hats and hose were bought for some members of the household such as the officers of the hunts. The evidence from the accounts will be set in context using material from other sources such as the Book of Rates. The Great Wardrobe bought <b>fabric,</b> <b>furs,</b> passementerie and accessories from a network of suppliers. London was the focal point for this group of suppliers and most of them were Londoners. In addition there was a small group of Italian merchants who supplied a small range of very expensive silks. The accounts provide a view of the range of textiles that were for sale in London, in terms of weave, quality, cost and colour. For those studying the court, the Great Wardrobe accounts provide insights into who received livery from the king, as members of the king’s court, his household and elements of his government. Many of these individuals lived in London or at Westminster and royal pageantry ensured that they would have been seen wearing their livery in and around London. Finally, the Great Wardrobe also derived part of its income from the land and property that it owned in and around the streets where the Wardrobe was based. <br/...|$|R
