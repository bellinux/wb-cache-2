5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern offset {{printing}} press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered {{the construction of a}} new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 inches above the 100-year <b>flood</b> <b>line.</b> This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and even deeper in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake favor by publishing the News-Miner's masthead on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E
25|$|The {{food items}} found allow to {{reconstruct}} {{a sequence of}} food intakes: first a four to five centimetres long fish; secondly a smaller fish of two to three centimetres; next a ten to twelve centimetres long lizard; then a fifteen to forty, depending on the identification, centimetres long lepidosaurian lizard; and finally some indeterminate vertebrate(s). Together they represent a varied diet showing that Scipionyx was an opportunistic generalist. That swift lizards had been caught and sea fish washed ashore had been gathered necessitating a prolonged patrolling of the <b>flood</b> <b>line,</b> both indicate a good mobility. If the prey animal in the stomach really was forty centimetres long, {{it is highly unlikely}} that the equally-sized hatchling had been able to subdue it, indicating parental care.|$|E

25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} <b>flood</b> <b>lines.</b> In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|R
50|$|They are {{normally}} passive in daytime and forage {{in the morning}} and afternoon, but can be strictly nocturnal in areas with many predators. They live in burrows up to 3 m deep, normally with two entrances covered with leaves to hide the burrow and to serve as an early warning system. Burrows are often near water, but always above the seasonal <b>flood</b> <b>line.</b> Predators except humans include jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, jaguarundi, bush dog, boa constrictor, and caiman.|$|E
50|$|After fast {{construction}} {{despite the}} difficulties, Line A opened on 5 November 1910 from Porte de Versailles to Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, despite being postponed {{because of the}} 1910 <b>flood.</b> <b>Line</b> B opened on 26 February 1911 from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen. The new network was technically {{very similar to that}} of its direct competitor, but the stations and rolling stock were more elaborate. The station names were written in porcelain instead of the enamel plates used by CMP, and directions to the trains were set out in tiles in the roofs of the tunnels.|$|E
50|$|The Nari Typhoon brought {{flooding}} {{to large}} portions of Taipei City including the Nankang Software Park in 2001. During that flood, some of the electrical systems {{in the basement of}} the Software Park were damaged. The Taipei City Government has built a large pumping station in along the Jilong River to reduce the risk of flooding. Phase I was retrofitted with flood gates to help reduce the risk of future flooding. In addition, new sections of the park have been designed with protection above the 200-year <b>flood</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|Tourism {{and land}} {{development}} was not permitted until German reunification {{as the entire}} lakeshore range was a restricted area. The GDR had erected a wall, several metres high, along the shore, so the lake could not be seen from East Germany. Entering the prohibited area was possible only with special permission. The border runs along the <b>flood</b> <b>line,</b> so that during normal water levels a narrow strip along the bank belongs to Schleswig-Holstein {{which was part of}} the Federal Republic. Thus, boats could ply the Trave delta without hindrance.|$|E
5000|$|The Badong county seat, {{commonly}} referred to simply as [...] "Badong", is {{in the town of}} Xinling (信陵镇, Xinling Zhen), located on the high southern banks of the Yangtze River channel. The Yangtze valley was flooded during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century after the construction of the Three Gorges Dam to the east, but Badong county seat was mostly above the <b>flood</b> <b>line,</b> and so more of the original town survives than is the case in many other river towns along this section of the Yangtze.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Museum {{and library}} were {{housed in a}} low, glass-walled building designed by Harrison & Abramovitz in 1951. By 1978, the Museum had outgrown its space. [...] Gunnar Birkerts designed a new addition, creating a flowing series of galleries with the library at their core, linked to the old building via light-filled, windowed ramps. With memories of the 1972 hurricane still fresh (see Flood Damage), the new galleries were raised high above the <b>flood</b> <b>line</b> on concrete pillars. The new Museum {{opened to the public}} on May 28, 1980, exactly 29 years after its first opening.|$|E

40|$|Post-tsunami field {{surveys of}} the Maldives Islands where carried out to {{document}} {{the effects of the}} tsunami inundation. The study area was situated in the islands of South Male Atoll that were some of the most heavily damaged islands of the Maldive Islands. The tsunami damaged the natural environment, vegetation, man-made structures, and residents. The maximum tsunami wave height was 3 - 4 m. This level of inundation exceeded the height of most residents. The wave height was greatest on the eastern rim of the South Male Atoll (closest to the tsunami source) and these islands were completely flooded. The islands within the interior of the atoll saw the lowest wave heights, and these were only marginally flooded. Surveys of <b>flood</b> <b>lines</b> left on the exterior and interior of structures were measured but proved to be substantially less than that reported by survivors. It appears that the highest inundation was not preserved as <b>flood</b> <b>lines.</b> We suggest that the turbulence associated with the tsunami inundation erased the highest lines or that they did not form due to an absence of debris and organic compounds that acted as adhesion during the initial flooding. Significant erosion was documented. Deposition took place in the form of sand sheets while only desultory deposition of coral clasts in marginal areas was found. Seasonal erosion, and storms are likely to remove most or all of the traces of the tsunami within these islands...|$|R

50|$|The {{timing of}} {{breeding}} activity {{varies depending on}} location: November to December in western Mexico, March to June in Costa Rica, January in Venezuela, and March in the lowlands of Ecuador. The male's courtship display involves fluffing out his breast feathers and running after the female; the species has no known aerial display. The nest is a bare ground scrape well above the tide or <b>flood</b> <b>line</b> on coasts and river shores or islands, or inland, often next to low cover, such as tufts of grass. The clutch is two pale buff eggs, spotted with brown. Like many ground-nesting species, adults perform a broken-wing display to lure presumed threats away from their nest and young.|$|E

50|$|When the Philippines {{came under}} the American {{sovereignty}} following the Spanish-American War, Malacañan Palace became the residence of the American Governor-General. Gen. Wesley Merritt became the first American Military Governor to reside at the Palace in 1898, while William Howard Taft became the first Civil Governor resident in 1901. They continued to improve and enlarge the Palace, buying more land and reclaiming more of the Pasig River. Left and right wings were added. An azotea facing the river was joined to the existing azotea. A staircase {{was transferred to the}} center of the foyer; and galleries were built around the stairway where the public could circulate during crowded receptions. Ground level was raised above the <b>flood</b> <b>line,</b> replacing wood with concrete, and beautifying the interiors with hardwood panelling and adding magnificent chandeliers.|$|E
