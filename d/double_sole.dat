40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate risk factors associated with foot lesions and lameness in Swiss dairy cows. Potential risk factors were recorded by means of examination of 1 ' 449 Swiss cows and the management systems of 78 farms during routine claw-trimming, and during personal interviews with the associated farmers. Statistical analysis of animal-based and herd level risk factors were performed using multivariate logistic regression models. The risk of being lame was increased in cows affected by digital dermatitis complex, heel-horn erosion, interdigital hyperplasia, Rusterholz' sole ulcer, deep laceration, <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> and severe hemorrhages. Cleanliness, BCS, affection with other foot lesions, breed, importance of claw health to the farmer, frequency of routine claw-trimming, producing according to the guidelines of the welfare label program RAUS, and silage feeding were shown to be associated with the occurrence of some of the evaluated foot lesions and lameness. The identified risk factors may help to improve management and the situation of lameness and claw health in dairy cows in Switzerland and other alpine areas with similar housing and pasturing systems...|$|E
40|$|Objectives- To {{evaluate}} {{the most important}} bovine digital lesions in shahrekord area and its correlation with locomotion scoring. Study Design- Cross- Sectional descriptive study. Animals- five hundred and eighteen cows inspected in two seasons. Methods- Three dairy farms on three scales (1 : Large, approximately 900 milking cows, 2 : Medium, approximately 100 milking cows, and 3 : Small, approximately 20 milking cows) were watched for lameness in 2005 - 2006. Locomotion scoring by Sprecher method (1 - 5 point scale) has been done for detection of lameness. Digital lesions in according to the area have been recorded. Sole ulcer, <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> and digital dermatitis were watched during study. Results were compared in different scores, parities, and days in milk (DIM). Results- Forty eight percent of the inspected hooves affected with different digital lesions in autumn that was lower than spring (58. 8 %). No statistical difference between prevalence of each disease were recorded between autumn and spring (P> 0. 05).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the frequency and distribution of lesions and/or diseases associated with lameness problems in commercial dairy herds with Holstein cows, in Baja California, Mexico, a two stage transverse epidemiological study was carried out in 592 milking cows with frequent lameness. During the first stage, a locomotion scoring method (LS), index that measures the cow?s capacity to walk was used. Cows were observed during milking assigning to each a score of 1 to 5, where LS 1 represents a normal cow and LS 5 represents cases of severe lameness. Results gave a 17. 5 % frequency of evident and severe lameness. During the second stage of this study, 37. 5 % (39 / 104) of the cows that had these scores (LS 4 and LS 5) were randomly selected and carefully inspected in order to detect and classify severe pathologies. In total, 89 lesions were detected; of these, 36 % were linked to white line disease; 27 % to double sole; 15. 7 % to corkscrew claw; 6. 8 % to fissures (vertical and horizontal); the remaining lesions (14. 5 %) were associated with abscess and talon ulcer cases, as well as digital and interdigital dermatitis. In conclusion, the high frequency of white line disease and <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> in the region may be mainly associated to two factors: diet formula and the lack of a routine preventive hoof trimming program...|$|E

40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} infringements of welfare in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between milk yield and foot lesions causing lameness in Chilean dairy cattle with the hypothesis that if we can demonstrate that lameness reduces yield, and so income, from lame dairy cows then we have both economic and welfare arguments for reducing lameness in dairy cattle. For one year, all lame cows from seven farms with Holstein Friesian cattle were treated by their herdsmen. Herdsmen were trained by the researcher and a colour atlas was utilised to assist in diagnosis of lesions. All abnormalities on the foot and the suspected cause of lameness were recorded, and cattle were treated. A two-level hierarchical model with repeated monthly test-day yields within cows was used to investigate the impact of <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> (DS), sole ulcer (SU), white line disease (WLD), digital dermatitis (DD) and all 'other' causes of lameness on milk yield before and after treatment. There were 1, 635 cows with complete data. Cattle with a DS were higher yielding than cattle that were never lame with a reduction in yield from four months before treatment. Cattle lame with DD were higher yielding than non-lame cattle before and after treatment. For all causes of lameness, yield increased the month after treatment. We conclude that lesions causing lameness reduced the milk yield of dairy cows in these seven herds in Chile. We discuss the current evidence base for prevention of lameness in dairy cows and hypothesise that rapid treatment is a feasible current approach to improve cow welfare immediately and probably reduce milk lost; more evidence for effective prevention is required. ...|$|E
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of the microvasculature of the bovine claw, an improved microcorrosion casting technique was developed. The new method was particularly adapted to surmount the difficulties of the examined vascular system, and rendered a complete vascular filling in all segments of the claw. Various injection media and techniques were tested and compared regarding filling degree and quality of the resulting microcorrosion cast. Completeness of vascular filling including the capillary bed was verified by histological examination of serial sections of plastic-injected specimens. Using the improved microcorrosion technique, 46 fore resp. hind limbs of adult cattle and three fore resp. hind limbs of calves aged eight to twelve weeks were cast. The arterial and venous blood supply of the fore and hind claw, particularly the vascular supply of the different segments of the claw and potential haemodynamic bottlenecks, were studied on the resulting microcorrosion specimens. Additionally, postmortal section-angiogramms of healthy and pathologically altered adult hind claws (heel horn erosion, <b>double</b> <b>sole,</b> digital dermatitis) were examined. By systematic scanning-electron-microscopic examination of the microcorrosion casts, the dermal and - if developed in the respective segment - subcutaneous microvascularisation of all segments of the claw was demonstrated for the first time. Special emphasis was laid on demonstrating the angio-architecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae, and differences between main and dew claws resp. between adult and juvenile claws. The results gained by scanning-electron-microscopy and the relation of subepidermal vessels and papillary body were verified by serial sections of all segments of the bovine claw. The angioarchitecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae of the different segments of the claw was closely related to the segment-specific formation of the papillary body. The basic pattern of the papillary vascular supply, comprising a centrally situated A. and V. papillaris which give rise to a segment-specific, subepidermal capillary net and form a peripheral capillary loop {{at the tip of the}} papilla, was confirmed for all segments of the claw. This basic vascular pattern showed segment-related modifications regarding size, form, direction and density of the vascular papillae, occurrence and density of the subepidermal capillary net and regarding length and contortion of the peripheral loop. In the dermal papillae, arteriovenous anastomoses could be demonstrated only sporadically. The marked two-dimensional laminar angioarchitecture was demonstrated in all areas of the wall segment. It consisted of centrally situated, axially orientated Aa. and Vv. lamellares, which branched in an arcadiform fashion and gave rise to a dense capillary and venular net at the base and ridge of the lamellae. At the base of the lamellae, direct and indirect arteriovenous anastomoses were demonstrated, but no regularity in their occurrence was detected. Arteriovenous anastomoses apparently do not play such an important role in the microcirculation of the pododerma as suggested in the literature. On six fore resp. hind limbs, histamine or lactate was administered before injection of the polymerising methacrylates. The influence of these vasoactive substances on the ungular vessels was studied on the resulting microcorrosion casts. In the papillae of all segments, only the central vascular loop of the dermal papillae is perfused under the influence of either histamine or lactate, whereas the circulation of the lamellae remains unaltered. But due to a dilation of the anastomosis between the dorsal branch of the arcus terminalis and the coronary vessels, the blood volume is partly shunted away from the wall segment. Comparing the results on main and dew resp. juvenile and adult claws, a relation between burdening of the claw and density and differentiation of the dermal papillary and lamellar blood vessels was detectable. Additional microcorrosion casts of five adult hind claws showing pathological alterations (heel horn erosion, <b>double</b> <b>sole,</b> white-line-disease, haemorrhages, wax-like consistency and yellow discoloration of the horn shoe, horn rings, digital dermatitis) were examined by scanning-electron-microscopy. The pathologically altered specimens featured an enlargement of the papillary surface by further partitioning of the papillary body, presumably as compensational adaptation to local ischaemia caused by improper or over-burdening of the claw. <br...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Claw {{disorders}} are important traits relevant to dairy cattle breeding from an economical and welfare point of view. Selection for reduced claw disorders can {{be based on}} hoof trimmer records. Typically, not all cows in a herd are trimmed. Our objectives were to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations for claw disorders and investigate the effect of selecting cows for trimming. The data set contained 50, 238 cows, of which 20, 474 cows {{had at least one}} claw trimming record, with a total of 29, 994 records. Six claw trimmers scored 14 different claw disorders: abscess (AB), corkscrew claw (CC), (inter-) digital dermatitis or heel erosion (DER), <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> (DS), hardship groove (HG), interdigital hyperplasia (IH), interdigital phlegmon (IP), sand crack (SC), super-foul (SF), sole hemorrhage (SH), sole injury (SI), sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), yellow discoloration of the sole (YD), and a combined claw disorder trait. Frequencies of the claw disorders for trimmed cows ranged from 0. 1 % (CC, YD, HG) to 23. 8 % (DER). More than half of the cows scored had at least one claw disorder. Heritability on the observed scale ranged from 0. 02 (DS, SH) to 0. 14 (IH) and on the underlying scale from 0. 05 to 0. 43 in trimmed cows. Genetic correlations between laminitis-related claw disorders were moderate to high, and the same was found for hygiene-related claw disorders. The effect of selecting cows for trimming was first investigated by including untrimmed cows in the analyses and assuming they were not affected by claw disorders. Heritabilities on the underlying scale showed only minor changes. Second, different subsets of the data were created based on the percentage of trimmed cows in the herd. Heritabilities for IH, DER, and SU tended to decrease when a higher percentage of cows in the herd were trimmed. Finally, a bivariate model with a claw disorder and the trait “trimming status” was used, but heritabilities were similar. Heritability for trimming status was relatively high (0. 09). Genetic correlations of trimming status with claw disorders were generally moderate to high. To conclude, the effect of selecting cows for trimming on the heritability for claw disorders is negligible. Selecting herds with a high fraction of cows being trimmed tended to decrease heritability. Trimming status, as such, is a heritable trait and correlated with claw disorders and is therefore an interesting trait to include in the genetic evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Performing a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWAS) {{might add}} {{to a better}} understanding of the development of claw disorders and the need for trimming. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to perform a GWAS on claw disorders and trimming status and to validate the results for claw disorders based on an independent data set. Data consisted of 20, 474 cows with phenotypes for claw disorders and 50, 238 cows with phenotypes for trimming status. Recorded claw disorders used in the current study were <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> (DS), interdigital hyperplasia (IH), sole hemorrhage (SH), sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), a combination of infectious claw disorders consisting of (inter-) digital dermatitis and heel erosion, and a combination of laminitis-related claw disorders (DS, SH, SU, and WLS). Of the cows with phenotypes for claw disorders, 1, 771 cows were genotyped and these cow data were used for the GWAS on claw disorders. A SNP was considered significant when the false discovery rate = 0. 05 and suggestive when the false discovery rate = 0. 20. An independent data set of 185 genotyped bulls having at least 5 daughters with phenotypes (6, 824 daughters in total) for claw disorders was used to validate significant and suggestive SNP detected based on the cow data. To analyze the trait “trimming status” (i. e., the need for claw trimming), a data set with 327 genotyped bulls having at least 5 daughters with phenotypes (18, 525 daughters in total) was used. Based on the cow data, in total 10 significant and 45 suggestive SNP were detected for claw disorders. The 10 significant SNP were associated with SU, and mainly located on BTA 8. The suggestive SNP were associated with DS, IH, SU, and laminitis-related claw disorders. Three of the suggestive SNP were validated in the data set of 185 bulls, and were located on BTA 13, BTA 14, and BTA 17. For infectious claw disorders, SH, and WLS, no significant or suggestive SNP associations were detected. For trimming status, 1 significant and 1 suggestive SNP were detected, both located close to each other on BTA 15. Some significant and suggestive SNP were located close to SNP detected in studies on feet and leg conformation traits. Genes with major effects could not be detected and SNP associations were spread across the genome, indicating that many SNP, each explaining a small proportion of the genetic variance, influence claw disorders. Therefore, to reduce the incidence of claw disorders by breeding, genomic selection is a promising approach...|$|E

Claw disorders affect cow welfare and profitability of farms {{and as such}} are important traits relevant to dairy cattle breeding. Aim of this thesis was to increase {{our understanding of the}} genetic {{background of}} claw disorders to enable selection for reduced claw disorder incidence. The claw disorders were: abscess, corkscrew claw, (inter-) digital dermatitis or heel erosion (DER), <b>double</b> <b>sole</b> (DS), hardship groove, interdigital hyperplasia (IH), interdigital phlegmon, sand crack, super-foul, sole hemorrhage (SH), sole injury, sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), and yellow discoloration of the sole. Data was collected on Holstein cows kept in dairy herds in France. Individual claw disorder frequencies ranged from 0. 1 % to 23. 8 % {{and more than half of}} the trimmed cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2012. Heritabilities were estimated for DER, DS, IH, SH, SU, and WLS, and ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 14. Repeatabilities ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 33. The need for trimming (“trimming status”) was found to be heritable as well with a heritability of 0. 09. A high need for trimming the claws of cows is unfavorable and therefore trimming status is an interesting trait to include in genetic evaluation. Most claw health traits had similar heritabilities and were genetically the same trait in different parities, lactation stages and herds with different trait frequencies. Claw disorder frequency in Montbeliarde cows ranged from 9. 4 % to 41. 1 % and 73 % of the cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2013. Heritabilities ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 09. Heritability for trimming status was 0. 06, confirming that trimming status is a heritable trait. To identify genomic regions associated with claw disorders and trimming status, a genome wide association study was performed. In total, 11 significant and 46 suggestive SNP were detected. Three of the suggestive SNP could be validated using a dataset of genotyped bulls. The detected SNP were spread across the genome and a major gene was not found. In the general discussion, alternative ways of measuring claw disorders were discussed. Accuracy of progeny testing and genomic selection for claw disorders was compared and a breeding program to reduce claw disorders was simulated in order to estimate selection response. Reducing the incidence of claw disorders is achievable with selection, but at a cost of a decrease in production.  ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} part of a {{cross-sectional}} project on freestall housing, and the aim was to compare locomotion and claw disorders in freestall dairy cattle herds with slatted concrete, solid concrete, or solid rubber flooring in the alleys. The final population for studying claw disorders consisted of 66 dairy herds with 2, 709 dry or lactating cows, whereas the population for studying locomotion consisted of 54 herds with 2, 216 cows. All herds used Norwegian Red as the main breed. The herds were visited by 15 trained claw trimmers one time during the period from the beginning of February to summer let-out onto pasture in 2008. The trimmers assessed locomotion scores (LocS) of all cows before trimming. At trimming, claw disorders were diagnosed and recorded in the Norwegian Claw Health Card. Estimates describing locomotion and claw disorders in the hind feet were identified by use of multivariable models fit with LocS and each claw disorder as dependent variables, respectively. Herd nested within claw trimmer was included in the model as random effects. The odds ratio (OR) of having LocS > 2 and LocS > 3 was 1. 9 and 2. 1, respectively, on slatted concrete compared with solid concrete. Fewer cases of dermatitis were found on slatted than solid concrete (OR= 0. 70) and a tendency was observed for fewer heel horn erosions on slatted concrete than solid rubber (OR= 0. 47). Hemorrhages of the white line and sole were more prevalent in herds housed on slatted and solid concrete than in those housed on solid rubber (OR= 2. 6 and OR= 2. 1, respectively). White line fissures were also more prevalent in herds housed on slatted and solid concrete than in those housed on solid rubber (OR= 2. 1 and OR= 2. 0, respectively). <b>Double</b> <b>soles</b> were more prevalent on solid concrete than solid rubber (OR= 4. 4). However, sole ulcers were less prevalent in herds with slatted and solid concrete than solid rubber (OR= 0. 39 and OR= 0. 53, respectively). Fewer corkscrewed claws were found on slatted concrete than both solid rubber and solid concrete (OR= 0. 60 and OR= 0. 44, respectively). More white line crossing fissures were recorded on slatted and solid concrete than solid rubber (OR= 3. 6 and OR= 3. 1, respectively). This shows that solid rubber flooring was favorable when most laminitis-related lesions were considered, whereas slatted concrete was favorable for infectious claw lesions and corkscrewed claws but not for locomotion...|$|R

40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{performed}} on 150 HF X Black Pied crossbred dairy cattle in order to compare the effects of rubber flooring and solid concrete floors on claw horn quality, horn growth and wear, net growth, lameness and claw health. To this end on a dairy farm with 628 dairy cattle one of two identical buildings was established with rubber flooring (KURA P®, Gummiwerk Kraiburg Elastik GmbH, Tittmoning/ Obb.). After calving the animals were either assigned to the group housed in the building with rubber flooring or the building with solid concrete floors. No differences existed {{between the two groups}} with respect to hygiene management and food and water supply. Approximately two weeks before calving heifers were transported to the dairy farm from a rearing farm, where the latter animals had been kept solely on straw bedding. In contrast, the dairy cows of the second and higher lactations on the farm already had a history of being kept alternately on free stalls with concrete flooring or straw bedding. The observation period lasted 15 weeks for single animals being kept either on rubber flooring or solid concrete floors. It started with functional claw trimming. At claw-trimming {{and at the end of}} the observational period documentation of claw lesions using the DLG-Score took place and horn samples were obtained from the sole segment of the right lateral hind claw, which were examined by light microscopy. The number of horn tubules per mm², the diameter of the horn tubules as well as the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules were determined. In addition net horn growth was determined from wear and growth characteristics of the claw horn at the dorsal wall. Lameness scoring (Sprecher et al., 1997) took place in two-week intervals. Claw health was evaluated by recording new cases of claw disorders that had occurred during the observation period and the cure rate. The number of horn tubules per mm² of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 22 to 28, 34 to 40, 39 to 44, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 31 to 33, 33 to 39, 35 to 46, respectively on solid concrete floors. At the end of the observation period the number of horn tubules for calved heifers kept on rubber flooring was lower than for the same group of animals kept on solid concrete floors. As the number of horn tubules is genetically fixed, the lower number of horn tubules in the group housed on rubber was thought to be the consequence of a higher water content of the horn located between the tubules leading to larger distances between the single horn tubules. The latter effect was not observed in animals with lactation numbers of two and higher. Horn from the sole segment of animals of the first lactation belonging either to the group kept on rubber or on solid concrete floors had lower numbers of horn tubules than cattle of lactation two and higher. The diameter of horn tubules of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 76 µm to 78 µm, 58 µm to 62 µm, 62 µm to 62 µm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 61 µm to 63 µm, 51 µm to 51 µm, 47 µm to 50 µm, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the diameter of horn tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. In addition there were no significant changes in the relation between the areas of the marrow zone to the cortex of the horn tubules between the two groups. The diameter of horn tubules being larger for cattle of the first lactation in either group suggests that the animals have also larger dermal papillae. The relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules ranged from 1. 74 to 1. 90, 1. 91 to 1. 87, 1. 69 to 1. 77, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 1. 93 to 2. 00, 1. 96 to 2. 14, 1. 91 to 2. 00, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. The monthly horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 4. 4 mm, 3. 9 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 4. 7 mm, 4. 1 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. The monthly horn wear of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 1. 8 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 5 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 6 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. This results in a monthly net horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle of 2. 5 mm, 3. 5 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 2 mm, 3. 4 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. Animals of the first lactation showed slightly smaller amounts of horn growth and horn wear compared to older animals. However, net horn growth did not differ between animals kept on rubber flooring versus solid concrete floors. The small amount of horn wear on solid concrete floors might be related to a lack of exercise of the animals due to the slippery solid concrete floors. The latter is also reflected in the net growth rates of claw horn of animals on concrete flooring being more than 3 mm/month. Net horn growth of the bulb of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 2. 0 mm, 2. 2 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 1. 5 mm, 1. 6 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. There were no differences observed with respect to the flooring types. The prevalence of lameness ranged from 14 % to 31 % (rubber floors) and 28 % to 42 % (solid concrete floors). They did not differ in the two groups at any date of observation. In addition, no differences were observed with respect to lactation numbers. The prevalence of laminitis-associated disorders were already high at the start of the observational period (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd or higher lactation: 71 %, 87 %, 87 % (rubber floors); 90 %, 99 %, 99 % (solid concrete floors). After 15 weeks laminitis-associated disorders were observed in nearly all claws. Defects of the white line (WLD), <b>sole</b> haemorrhages and <b>double</b> <b>soles</b> were the most prominent lesions observed in this context. There was no difference found with respect to the occurrence of new cases of defects of the white line and sole haemorrhages between the two groups, however the cure rate of the latter diseases was higher for animals of the third and higher lactation that were kept on rubber floors. In addition, the latter effect was also observed for defects of the white line and haemorrhages of animals of the first lactation kept on rubber flooring. Based on the latter findings the conclusion can be drawn that the type flooring does not lead to a reduction in cases of subclinical laminitis which might have been caused by fermentation disorders, but rubber flooring seems to enhance the process of recovery. The occurrence of new cases and the cure rates of <b>double</b> <b>soles,</b> slurry heel, digital dermatitis and interdigital dermatitis were not affected by the type of flooring. Animals of the first lactation that were kept on rubber floors had a smaller number of lesions related to dermatitis digitalis. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the study: Claw horn quality of rubber flooring dairy cattle does not differ from cattle kept on solid concrete floors. Net growth of dairy cattle kept on rubber floors is not higher as net growth of dairy cattle kept on slippery solid concrete floors. Prevalence of lameness does not differ between cattle kept on rubber or solid concrete floors. Keeping cattle on rubber floors does not lead to a better claw health if management based problems such moisture of alleys, bad stall comfort or feeding are not previously solved...|$|R
50|$|Lugosi {{suffered}} exhaustion at {{some point}} during the filming, and his absence from the set, combined with his physical limitations at age sixty, required the liberal use of stand-ins. Stuntman Gil Perkins allegedly portrayed the Monster in the character's first scene (thirty-five minutes into the film) and during much of the monsters' fight (conclusive documentation needed). Although a still exists of Lugosi in the ice, when viewers see the Monster for the first time (including closeups), it is actually the stunt double Perkins. Stuntman Eddie Parker is usually credited as Lugosi's <b>sole</b> <b>double,</b> but his primary stunt role was thought to be that of the Wolf Man. However, he does appear as the Monster in at least one shot, and yet a possible third stuntman also stands in for Lugosi in two brief sequences. The edited result unfairly suggests that Lugosi had to be doubled even in non-strenuous scenes, and the multiple use of alternating stuntmen in both closeups and medium shots damages the continuity of Lugosi's characterization. As an example, the doubles in the fight scene stiffen their arms, even though that was a cautious habit of the previously-blind Monster; for instance, a medium shot shows Lugosi pulling down a cabinet with his arms naturally bent at the elbows, but the next shot is of a double completing the task with straightened arms.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIM: The {{impact of}} basal core {{promoter}} (BCP) and precore (PC) mutants of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) on liver disease severity remains controversial. The {{aim of the}} present study was to screen BCP and PC mutations in 252 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive carriers in France and to assess relationships between these mutations and severe fibrosis. METHODS: Direct sequencing of the precore/core gene was used to detect A 1762 T/G 1764 A and G 1757 A mutations in the BCP and G 1896 A and G 1899 A mutations in the PC region. RESULTS: The prevalences of A 1762 T/G 1764 A, G 1757 A, G 1896 A, and G 1899 A mutations were 34. 1 %, 38. 7 %, 54. 9 %, and 29. 3 % (P /=F 3 Metavir) were older age (P < 0. 001), male gender (P = 0. 012), elevated alanine aminotransferase (P < 0. 001), and the double A 1762 T/G 1764 A mutant with no other mutations (P = 0. 011). Interestingly, the association of the G 1899 A mutation with the double A 1762 T/G 1764 A mutant significantly counteracted the deleterious effect of the <b>sole</b> <b>double</b> A 1762 T/G 1764 A mutant (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 28 vs. OR = 3. 55, respectively, P = 0. 028). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the A 1762 T/G 1764 A mutation have a higher risk of severe fibrosis. The G 1899 A mutation is a protective factor against severe fibrosis that counteracted the deleterious effect of the A 1762 T/G 1764 A mutation. Finally, host phenotypic and HBV genotypic markers independently predict fibrosis severity...|$|R
40|$|Selection of {{appropriate}} varieties of component crops {{is important to}} maximize the productivity of double intercropping. Field experiments were conducted at Alemaya in 2003 and 2004 and at Hirna in 2004, eastern Ethiopia, to evaluate the agronomic performance of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties in double intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.), select suitable common bean varieties for double intercropping and assess the productivity of the system. Common bean varieties were double intercropped with maize in Belg (short rainy season) and Meher (long rainy season). The common bean varieties on the average matured 15 days earlier during the Belg compared with the Meher season. Bean variety MAM- 25 matured at the earliest while TY 3396 - 12 was late and produced {{the highest number of}} nodules (78. 3) per plant. Bean varieties grown in intercropping with maize showed significant differences in seed yield (kg ha - 1) in Belg. Sole cropped bean showed significantly higher leaf area index during Meher season in 2004 and higher number of nodules, pods and seed yield (kg ha - 1) than intercropped bean. The common bean varieties had no significant effect on LAI, height, number of ears and grain yield (kg ha - 1) of the associated maize, but harvest index at Alemaya in 2003. The total LERs indicated 25 to 66 % yield advantage of <b>double</b> intercropping over <b>sole</b> cropping at Alemaya and 6 to 46 % at Hirna. Double intercropping of common bean variety Gofta with maize gave the highest gross monetary value (6054. 8 ETB ha - 1 at Alemaya, 8097. 1 ETB ha - 1 at Hirna). The study proved the agronomic and economic feasibility of double intercropping of common bean with maize under smallholder farming system of eastern Ethiopia...|$|R
