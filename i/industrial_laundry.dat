5|$|Preservation of {{elements}} of Portland's <b>industrial</b> <b>laundry</b> era, {{and its relation}} to the women’s labor movement {{and the rise of the}} middle class in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center.|$|E

5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines.

40|$|The <b>laundry</b> <b>industrial</b> {{processes}} are great water consumers and generate high volumes of aggressive wastewaters to the environment. This work presents a laboratory scale {{evaluation of a}} combination of coagulation-flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and ozonation process stages for laundry wastewater treatment in order to reuse the treated water in the original productive process. The wastewaters were obtained from two <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> with a washing capacity of 1 – 3 ton/day. The coagulation-flocculation processes were evaluated for two coagulants (aluminum sulfate and aluminum polychloride), both in doses between 25 and 150 mg/L, and pH values between 5 and 10. In the filtration stage, sand, anthracite, both combined in a multistage filtration, and filtration through activate carbon were evaluated at different filtration rates.

30|$|The {{statutory}} {{minimum wage}} regulation for <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> affects laundries which achieve more than 80  % of their turnover with commercial clients. The impact could only be explored by descriptive analysis and qualitative research (company survey, company case studies and expert interviews) which is mainly due to a severe lack of data. The findings of the evaluation suggest that the minimum wages have had a remarkable impact on wages. About {{one third of the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> which are principally covered by the minimum wage regulation (and even two thirds in eastern Germany) had to increase wages after the implementation of the minimum wages. More than 31  % of these companies increased the wages of employees in higher pay levels as well. Effects of the minimum wage regulation on employment and competition could not be detected. In company case studies, we found that other factors are assessed as more relevant for competition. The representative company survey among laundries indicated that there is a twilight zone relating to the area of application of the minimum wage regulation. Some companies assessed that they had to pay the minimum wages even though their turnover with commercial clients was at or below 80  %. Other companies with more than 80  % turnover with commercial clients did not regard themselves as being covered by the minimum wage regulation. These uncertainties may be related to ambiguous criteria of classification or a lack of information. Difficulties with the classification which may hamper the identification of non-compliance were also mentioned by the control authorities.|$|R
5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{affecting}} the productivity of workers in industry is quality of air in the working ambience. The quality of air can be characterized by means of microbial contaminants, chemicals, gases, allergen, odour or any mass or energy stressor that can induce health issues. This study {{is concerned with the}} presence of excessive detergent odour in <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries.</b> Odours are basically chemicals dissolved in air which we may be perceived by the sense of olfaction and always referred to as unpleasant smell. As for the case of <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries,</b> the effect of detergent odour becomes significant as cleaning processes simultaneously discharge high detergent concentration to the surrounding air which may lead to serious health issues apart from reducing workers’ performance. Therefore, a design of liquid spray gas scrubber had been proposed in this work as a means to overcome the problem. A prototype has been designed and developed to prove the working principle of the scrubber. By taking that the scrubbing efficiency is independent of the chemical specie, a solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) was used as a source of odour as alternative to detergent. This is due to the unavailibity of tools to measure detergent odour while concentration of NH 4 OH in the scrubbing liquid, i. e. water can be easily determined. From the tests conducted, scrubbing efficiency up to 36 % is obtained in a single stage, which is encouraging considering that the scrubber head was a simple shower nozzle. With improved designs of the spray, the scrubber unit may be used to improve indoor working environments...|$|R

This characteristic was used to apply derivatives as auxiliary coagulation with tannin in wastewater treatment for <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries.</b> The results showed that the association of tannin and cationic hemicelluloses (3, 200 mg L- 1) is important because the turbidity removal was greater than 95 % in all range of pH, including alkaline regions.

5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of these assessments has been toward reducing the contaminants and wastes {{at the source}} as opposed to cleaning up waste water after the fact. In order to run your shop as economically and efficiently as possible, you should reduce all types of wastes including hazardous wastes, solid wastes, air emissions, and water discharges. It has become apparent that there are shortfalls in the command and control end-of-pipe regulations. The sources of pollution within <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries</b> must be identified and solutions found which reduce or eliminate the generation of the wastes through source reduction, reuse and recycling.

Methods: The survey consisted of two phases; (i) identification of activities with potential exposure to antineoplastic drugs by literature review, interviews, questionnaires and workplace visits, (ii) exploratory measurements of exposure and surface contamination in selected sectors. Results: Eight sectors were identified with potential exposure to antineoplastic drugs: phar-maceutical industry, pharmacies, universities, veterinary medicine, nursing homes, home care, laundry facilities, and waste treatment. Four sectors were of primary concern: veterinary medicine, home care, nursing homes and <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries.</b> The populations potentially exposed in these sectors vary considerably (from several tens to thousands of workers), as do their levels of exposure.

40|$|The {{undesired}} redeposition of indigo {{during the}} enzymatic ageing of denim garments with cellulases {{is a problem}} widely known in <b>industrial</b> <b>laundries.</b> Today, the usual procedure carried out to reduce the undesired side-effect is post-washing, but so far little information {{can be found in}} literature about efficient methods to achieve a maximum blue-white contrast in denim garments.

Different chemical reaqents and textile auxiliaries were tested and compared, Up to 80 % of the initial colour could be easily removed with one-component washing-solutions and under conditions of high mechanical agitation. Ethoxylated linear fat alcohols and a modified poly acrylic acid were found to be the most efficient chemical reagents at low concentrations to desorb indigo from cotton. Non-ionic surtactants desorbed more indigo-with a decreasing degree of ethoxytation. With non-ionic surfactants the desorption at indigo improved with a decreasing degree of ethoxylation.
