40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Humpback {{whales are}} a major {{predator}} in Sitka Sound, possibly consuming {{as much as a}} half-ton of Pacific herring per day. These large migratory baleen whales congregate in Sitka Sound to feed on schools of Pacific herring which spawn in April. In recent decades humpback whale abundance has increased tremendously in Sitka Sound after recovering from near extinction due to commercial whaling. In order to assess the long-term impact on <b>herring</b> by humpback <b>whales,</b> I estimated humpback whale abundance from 1981 to 2011. To do so I developed a Bayesian mark-recapture method for small sample sizes. I also modified a multi-strata Hilborn model to account for sporadic availability of whales in Sitka Sound. The multi-million dollar sac roe fishery in Sitka Sound is managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) with an Age-Structured Assessment model (ASA). I modified the standard ASA model by including the humpback whale abundance estimates as a covariate for herring natural mortality. I found that there is no significant effect of humpback <b>whales</b> on <b>herring</b> mortality. In fact, both Pacific <b>herring</b> and humpback <b>whale</b> abundance have increased together, reaching their maximum values in 2011. This suggests that some other factor, perhaps better marine survival for both species, is driving their upwards trend...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to investigate the}} seasonal occurrence of photoidentified killer whale pods {{in relation to the}} distribution of Norwegian spring-spawning herring and whether or not pod-specific differences in the occurrence or diet of killer whales could be demonstrated. In a 4 -year study, the killer whales occurred in different areas during the summer and the fall–winter, and these areas coincided with the distribution areas of <b>herring.</b> Killer <b>whales</b> were encountered most frequently during October–January when the whole adult and part of the adolescent stock of spring-spawning herring wintered in the study area. Thirty-nine killer whale pods were identified, and generally the same pods were encountered each year of the study. Differences in the timing and areas of occurrence of pods could be demonstrated. Adult and adolescent herring seemed to be the main prey of the killer whales during both fall–winter and summer. Six new species were added to the list of known prey species of Norwegian killer whales. The present pattern of seasonal occurrence of killer whales in the coastal waters of northern Norway is expected to change as a result of growth in the Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock...|$|R
40|$|In a {{model with}} four species ± cod, capelin, <b>herring</b> and minke <b>whales</b> ± the ®sh populations are age and length distributed, while the minke whale is {{age and sex}} distributed. The time step is one month, {{and there are two}} areas (The Barents Sea and parts of the Norwegian Sea). There is a food-web with minke whales as top predators, {{consuming}} herring, capelin and cod according to a non-linear consumption function in available prey abundance. The consumption function for minke whales is roughly estimated. The opportunistic minke whale may forage on plankton and other ®sh than cod, capelin or herring, and is thus, modelled as having carrying capacity and demographic parameters independent of the status of the ®sh stocks in the model. The ®sh-®sheries are managed by ®xed VPA-based ®shing mortalities (cod and herring) and Captool (capelin), while minke whaling is managed according to the RMP of the IWC. The model is stochastic in ®sh recruitment and in survey indices for minke whales. The model is simulated over 100 -year periods in a number of scenarios spanned by nine experimental factors. The core of the experimental design is an orthogonal array with 27 points. The primary study variable is the tuning of the RMP, and the response variables are catches and stock sizes of cod, <b>herring</b> and minke <b>whale.</b> The responses are taken as yearly means over the last 90 years of the period. When the tuning of the RMP is changed from the current level of targeting the ®nal stock at 72 % of carrying capacity to 60 %, the annual catch of whales increases with some 300 animals, while the annual catch of cod increases with some 0. 1 million ton on the average.

25|$|A similar great {{migration}} of herrings occurs each {{year during the}} summer plankton bloom {{along the coast of}} British Columbia and Alaska. The migration is featured in the final episode of the 2009 BBC wildlife documentary Nature's Great Events. In winter, the coastal fjords and inlets are relatively lifeless, and the resident Steller sea lions must dive deeper and further from the coast to catch the widely-dispersed <b>herring.</b> Humpback <b>whales</b> overwinter in the warm Pacific waters off Hawaii, where new mothers suckle their calves. They begin their 3,000 mile journey north in early spring, when the sea lions also give birth to their young. Spring storms disturb nutrients in the water which, together with the strengthening power of the sun, act as the catalysts for the plankton bloom. Huge shoals of herring arrive to spawn, turning the shallows milky white. The herring sift plankton from the water. In their wake come larger predators, including Pacific white-sided dolphins and killer whales. Common murres dive under the herring shoals and pick off the fish from below, pinning them to the surface. Their defence is to form a bait ball, but gulls gathering on the surface attack them from above. The finale to the programme features unique underwater footage of humpbacks engulfing whole bait balls, and reveals their co-operative hunting behaviour called bubble-netting.|$|R
40|$|Management of {{a marine}} {{ecosystem}} {{is regarded as}} a game played by the Government Agency against Nature. The quality of the management strategy is evaluated using models for the strategy taken by Nature. These models should be sufficiently realistic and also practical to implement and investigate on a computer. Whaling and sealing in the Barents Sea are of little economic interest of themselves, but might impact some other fisheries positively. Our model to evaluate strategies for whaling and sealing includes cod, herring, capelin, harp seals and minke whales, and emphasizes interactions between these populations caused by predation. For proposed management strategies, the stochastic system is repeatedly simulated over 100 years, and the strategies are evaluated by the resulting cod, capelin and herring TACs that are calculated from fixed rules. Our line of study was first pursued in the 1990 s with an emphasis on management strategies for cod, <b>herring</b> and minke <b>whales.</b> It is now extended and refined with harp seals included, and with improved modelling of how predation mortality in the fish species is non-linearly linked to the abundances of all the modelled species...|$|R
40|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{occurred}} in March 1989 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, {{and was one}} of the worst environmental disasters on record in the United States. Despite long-term data collection over the nearly three decades since the spill, tremendous uncertainty remains as to how significantly the spill affected fishery resources. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and some wild Pacific salmon populations (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Prince William Sound declined in the early 1990 s, and have not returned to the population sizes observed in the 1980 s. Discerning if, or how much of, this decline resulted from the oil spill has been difficult because a number of other physical and ecological drivers are confounded temporally with the spill; some of these drivers include environmental variability or changing climate regimes, increased production of hatchery salmon in the region, and increases in populations of potential predators. Using data pre- and post-spill, we applied time-series methods to evaluate support for whether and how herring and salmon productivity has been affected by each of five drivers: (1) density dependence, (2) the EVOS event, (3) changing environmental conditions, (4) interspecific competition on juvenile fish, and (5) predation and competition from adult fish or, in the case of <b>herring,</b> humpback <b>whales.</b> Our results showed support for intraspecific density-dependent effects in herring, sockeye, and Chinook salmon, with little overall support for an oil spill effect. Of the salmon species, the largest driver was the negative impact of adult pink salmon returns on sockeye salmon productivity. Herring productivity was most strongly affected by changing environmental conditions; specifically, freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska was linked to a series of recruitment failures-before, during, and after EVOS. These results highlight the need to better understand long terms impacts of pink salmon on food webs, as well as the interactions between nearshore species and freshwater inputs, particularly as they relate to climate change and increasing water temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The whale-watching {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of the New England regional economy with about one million tourism visitors. Humpback whales are the most popular whale-watching targets, whose primary activity in this area is feeding that mainly on herrings. Meanwhile, the value of herring fisheries is more than $ 20 M annually and it is the major supply for canneries and lobster bait. According to the historical document, over-harvesting of herrings may cause the dramatic depletion of humpback whale stock. This research investigates the economic benefits and losses of the ban on the harvesting for herring in the New England area. I compare the revenue of herring fisheries and whale-watching under different herring harvest levels through integrated economic-ecological analysis. The marine ecosystem side will be modeled through EMAX food web. The socio-economical analysis focuses on the <b>herring</b> fisheries and <b>whale</b> watching market price and quantity. By comparing the two-sided benefits, this research evaluates if herring should be left in the marine ecosystem or harvested. The result indicated that the decrease of herring harvest would not cause dramatic increase of the whale stock,, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the decline of herring landing would not significantly or equally increases the revenue from the whale watching tourism. The result suggests that the current herring fisheries landing might not have a significant impact on the whale population...|$|R
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small <b>herring</b> and sprats; <b>whale</b> carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|R
40|$|Cetacean {{observations}} obtained during sighting surveys for abundance estimation {{can also}} be used to investigate cetacean habitat and prey selection, the principal processes underlying cetacean distributions. In this paper, we investigate habitat and prey selection of minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), fin (B. physalus) and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales and Lagenorhynchus (Atlantic white-sided L. acutus and white-beaked L. albirostris) dolphins observed along predetermined cruise tracks along the Barents Sea shelf edge in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The observations were combined with simultaneously collected data on habitat (depth, sea surface temperature, and temperature gradients) and prey (plankton, 0 -group fish, capelin and herring) distributions in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to investigate habitat and prey selection. Minke whales were associated with cold waters and herring, and capelin in years with low <b>herring</b> abundance. Fin <b>whales</b> were mainly associated with northern cold and deep waters, as well as capelin, 0 -group fish and plankton. Lagenorhynchus dolphins were associated with capelin. Finally, sperm whales were associated with deep waters and 0 -group fish. Sperm whales were probably indirectly attracted to 0 -group fish through preying on predatory fish such as Sebastes spp. and the squid Gonatus spp. The cetacean species responded differently to annual variation in habitat and prey distributions. Minke and fin whale distributions and abundances remained similar between years within the study area, suggesting that these species are generalists responding to environmental changes by switching between prey species. Conversely, Lagenorhynchus dolphins shifted northwards, likely due to tracking the shifting capelin distributions. The results are discussed in light of how such cetacean habitat and cetacean prey relationships can be valuable for the proper assessment of population sizes and trends, both through guiding the design of sighting surveys and assessing whether changes in abundances within fixed surveyed areas are due to distribution shifts or changes in population sizes. </div...|$|R
