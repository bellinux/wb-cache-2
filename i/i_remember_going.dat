25|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> out to bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts {{had just}} taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw {{decision}} when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with Walt Shepperd, Lewis said:My {{mother was a}} worker, worked in the garment trades. My mother was an indomitable spirit. My grandfather had no sons. He had six daughters. They lived in Poland or Russia, every five years it would change. My mother being the oldest daughter, they saved their money, {{and when she was}} about sixteen they sent her to the United States, not knowing a word of English. She went to work in the garment center, worked her back and rear-end off and brought over to the United States her five sisters and two parents. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> on picket lines with my mother. My mother wouldn't back down to anyone.|$|E

500|$|... "My mother {{growing up}} was really, really close friends with an Indian woman. She {{ended up having}} an {{arranged}} marriage oddly enough and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to her wedding {{and it was one}} of the only weddings that I've EVER been to, besides my own mother's, and it was the biggest party, the most fun ever. So when I was doing 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... and it made me think of that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding! And I wanna do it in India! And I wanna do it properly...and I put an elephant in there for good luck." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E

"Mr. Quatermain," [...] she said, [...] "I {{suppose that}} I {{must have been}} ill, for the last thing <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is <b>going</b> {{to sleep on the}} night after you started for the {{hippopotamus}} hunt.

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> once <b>going</b> to see {{him when}} he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an {{unfavorable}} omen. [...] "No", he replied, [...] "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." ...|$|R

My father was German-Jewish and had a very heavy German accent, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> home with a black boyfriend and being lambasted by my parents. [...] I’ve grown up with the notion that immigrants very quickly become settled and turn their anger and hostility on the following wave. I get that in Barking." ...|$|E
2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I {{thought he looked}} a bit weird after the show—I didn't know that he'd taken a whole bloody bottle of weird-looking {{psychiatric}} pills. It was a bad time. Ray suddenly {{announced that he was}} going to end it all ... I think he took the pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a bit crazy. I didn't know what happened—I suddenly got a phone call saying he was in the hospital. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to the hospital after they'd pumped his stomach and it was bad.|$|E

'Yes,' said Elizabeth, 'I {{remember}} {{some things}} as well {{as if they had}} happened yesterday, and others are all confusion in my mind; <b>I</b> quite <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to kiss her, the last day, and how strange and silent and sad all the room looked, and Aunt Anne keeping quite calm and composed in the room, but beginning to cry as soon as she had led me out. I shall never forget the awful mysterious feelings I had then.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> my {{brother-in-law}} <b>going</b> {{for a short}} sea trip once, {{for the benefit of}} his health. He took a return berth from London to Liverpool; and when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket.|$|R

We were due to play 2 days later. Our first-ever big arena gig, it's called Sheffield Arena now. At the sound check, I was strumming away on the acoustic guitar, and our kid (Liam Gallagher) said, 'What's that you're singin'?' I wasn't singing anyway, I was just making it up. And our kid said, 'Are you singing 'So Sally can wait'.' And I was like – that's genius! So I started singing, 'So Sally can wait.' <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> back to the dressing room and writing it out. It all came really quickly after that." [...] Noel claims that the character [...] "Lyla", from Oasis' 2005 single is the sister of Sally. In the interview on the DVD released with the special edition of Stop the Clocks, Noel also revealed that a girl approached him {{and asked him if}} Sally was the same girl as in the Stone Roses' track [...] "Sally Cinnamon". Noel replied that he'd never thought of that but thought it was good anyway.|$|E

5000|$|According to his {{grandson}} Simon Tolkien, Tolkien {{in the last}} years of his life was disappointed by some of the liturgical reforms and changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council: <b>I</b> vividly <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything but that," [...] {{said the}} gentleman. [...] "People {{never talk about}} their own trades.

60|$|Old ladies, not {{accustomed}} to the river, are always intensely nervous of steam launches. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> up once from Staines to Windsor—a stretch of water peculiarly rich in these mechanical monstrosities—with a party containing three ladies of this description.

50|$|Writing in 2008 of the 1940s, Elis White {{said that}} the well, spring, or spoot had the purest, clearest water {{and as far as}} I know came when Scott’s Loch up around Knadgerhill was drained to run into the river at various places. In any case, it was a popular drink for invalids and it was a common sight for us to see people walking away from it {{carrying}} a bottle of the water from it. Even a jug in earlier days, and <b>I</b> well <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to it as a wee lassie along with my father to take some to my Granny in Townhead.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>going,</b> {{as a young}} person, to {{a lecture}} by Auguste Forel, whose book The Sexual Question was a {{sensation}} {{at the time and}} which impressed me greatly. I also met Magnus Hirschfeld very early on through a girl friend, who knew the police official Kopp, who was in charge investigating of sexual offenses. He, in turn, was a friend of Hirschfeld's, and so I met both men. That was around 1907. They repeatedly took me along on their rounds through the homosexual bars in Berlin. <b>I</b> especially <b>remember</b> the 'Eldorado' with its drag shows, where also many of the customers appeared in the clothing of the other sex. The word [...] "transvestite" [...] had not yet been invented. Hirschfeld coined it only in 1910 in his well-known study.|$|R

Otherwise, I am feeling all the better for last night's festivity. But I cannot understand {{how it is that}} I did not meet Charles Sadler when I so fully intended to do so.
