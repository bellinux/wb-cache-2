5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought <b>hard,</b> <b>they</b> were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought <b>hard,</b> <b>they</b> were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E

5|$|The action {{came about}} as a direct {{consequence}} of the Battle of Grand Port three weeks earlier, in which a British squadron had been destroyed in a failed attack on Grand Port harbour on Isle de France. This gave the French forces on the island a significant regional advantage, outnumbering the British frigate on the recently captured Île Bourbon, commanded by Commodore Josias Rowley, by six to one. British reinforcements were hastily despatched to the area but the French were blockading Île Bourbon in force and the arriving reinforcements were in constant danger of attack by more powerful French units. Africaine was the first ship to reinforce Rowley's squadron, but within three days of her arrival in the region was engaged by two French ships while attempting to drive them away from Saint Denis on Île Bourbon. Corbet was severely wounded in the opening exchanges and subsequently died. Although his crew fought <b>hard,</b> <b>they</b> were overwhelmed by the French frigates and forced to surrender, only for Rowley to arrive in HMS Boadicea and drive off the French warships, recapturing Africaine.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} {{of support for}} rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (T'owd Tin Pot) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams {{found it difficult to}} play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.|$|E

She explained: [...] "Sometimes, when you work with producers who are artists, it’s very <b>hard,</b> <b>They</b> are doing their thing … and things got a little chaotic.” Derrick G.

500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E

500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. [...] In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show", for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> had cleaned. [...] Sylvester states that this is true in much of Angelou's poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. [...] Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in which understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. [...] Hagen connects this poem with the final scene in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, which describes her encounter with her friend, a drug addict who shows her the effects of his drug habit. [...] According to Hagen, the poem is full of disturbing images, such as drugs being a slave master and the junkie being tied to his habit like a monkey attached to the street vendor's strap.|$|E
500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show" [...] in Diiie, for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> had cleaned. Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
