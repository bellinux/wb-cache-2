5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> dark and large-toothed, regillus <b>is</b> <b>large</b> and dark, and albiventer <b>is</b> <b>large</b> and relatively pale.|$|E

Example: five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than four, and four <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three, therefore five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three. But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than three.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} diurnal {{variation}} of the air-pressure system in the urban Tokyo. In summer, the pressure drop in the morning <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the suburban Tokyo, and in the afternoon <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the downtown Tokyo. After sunset, firstly the pressure rise <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the downtown Tokyo, thereafter <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the suburban Tokyo. In winter, the diurnal variation is almost opposite. Commonly, while the area-averaged air-pressure drops, the pressure drop <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the downtown; while rises, the pressure rise <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the suburban. The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides also contribute to these diurnal variations...|$|R

5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble <b>is</b> <b>large</b> enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant <b>is</b> <b>large</b> with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E

5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient <b>is</b> <b>large</b> and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
