500|$|Respondents {{argued that}} finding {{employers}} liable for factual mistakes would place substantial costs upon employers. The Court rejected this argument, saying that an employee would {{still need to}} prove the employer acted out of an <b>improper</b> <b>motive.</b> Referring to Heffernan's case and those like it, the Court said that [...] "the employee will, if anything, find {{it more difficult to}} prove that motive, for the employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer's intent".|$|E

Does such an appointment as that of Munny Begum, in the most barefaced evasion of his orders, appear to your Lordships a matter that contains no just presumptions of guilt, so that, when a charge of bribery comes upon it, you are prepared to reject it, as if the action were so clear and proper that no man could attribute it to an <b>improper</b> <b>motive?</b> And as to the man,--is Mr. Hastings a man against whom a charge of bribery is improbable? Why, he owns it. He is a professor of it. He reduces it into scheme and system. He glories in it. He turns it to merit, and declares it is the best way of supplying the exigencies of the Company. Why, therefore, should it be held improbable?--But I cannot mention this proceeding without shame and horror.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, where the {{defendant}} is contrite and admits an <b>improper</b> <b>motive</b> (something no jury will take lightly), or {{there is evidence to}} support such a finding, the defendant’s liability risk is reduced to declaratory relief, attorneys’ fees and costs if the defendant proves it would have taken the same action even without considering the protected trait. The quid pro quo for this reduced financial risk is the lesser standard of liability (the challenged employment action need only be a motivating factor).|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute <b>improper</b> <b>motives</b> to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 March 2002, {{speaking}} in the Senate under parliamentary privilege, Heffernan made accusations against a serving judge.

Senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray (Labor) and Aden Ridgeway (Australian Democrats) each alleged that Heffernan had deliberately structured his speech this way in order to conceal the fact that he was violating parliamentary standing orders.

25|$|MPs must confine their {{observations}} {{to the subject}} being discussed and may not talk about irrelevant matters, and will be ruled out of order if they use offensive and insulting language about other MPs.

5000|$|Statements {{published}} in the discharge of a duty, the exercise of a right or the furtherance of a legitimate interest. There is no closed list; public policy determines what should be included. Usually the right to give has a corresponding duty, legal or moral or social, to receive the information. If not, {{there must be a}} corresponding interest, and the interest must be legitimate. The test is objective and guided by public policy. Malice or <b>improper</b> <b>motive,</b> or the pursuit some illegitimate purpose, will lead to the forfeiture of the defence.|$|E
50|$|The {{allegedly}} <b>improper</b> <b>motive</b> was {{the hotel}} owner's underlying purpose of compelling plaintiff {{to pay a}} bill owed for plaintiff's alleged rental of a room in defendant's hotel. It was claimed that through the unlawful use of the warrant and threat of arrest, the defendant was able to obtain the sum of money allegedly owed by plaintiff. In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court admonished that it was sufficient to show that regularly issued process {{had been used to}} accomplish an improper purpose in order to set forth a cause of action for abuse of process.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, a case {{properly}} analyzed under U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (what {{some commentators}} {{refer to as}} pretext cases) involves the plaintiff alleging an <b>improper</b> <b>motive</b> for the defendant’s conduct, while the defendant disavows that motive and professes only a non-discriminatory motive. On the other hand, a true mixed motive case under U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m) involves either a defendant who [...] [...] [...] admits to a partially discriminatory reason for its actions, while also claiming {{it would have taken}} the same action {{were it not for the}} illegitimate rationale or [...] [...] [...] is otherwise credible evidence to support such a finding.|$|E
5000|$|Equitable {{principles}} {{can also}} limit {{the granting of}} equitable remedies.

The most important limitation relating to equitable remedies is that an equitable remedy will not lie against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.|$|R

The Inspector can deal with complaints about the conduct of the ICAC or its officers which concern abuses of power, impropriety, misconduct of any kind, lengthy delays in investigation and maladministration.

50|$|It is {{the conduct}} of the hearing which underlines that the judge had become too {{personally}} involved in the decision he was being asked to make to guarantee the necessary judicial objectivity which would be required in the trustee proceedings. I identify three particular features. First, the witness who supported the application was in effect cross-examined by the judge in something of the style of an advocate instructed to oppose the application. Second, the submission by counsel for the applicant that the judge had given evidence was in the circumstances unsurprising, and the concerns he expressed on this topic were validly made. Finally, the judge impugned the good faith of the application, a conclusion repeated in the strongest terms in his judgment when there is no shred of evidence to suggest some ulterior or <b>improper</b> <b>motive</b> behind the application.|$|E

In this the law, under the influence of equity, has developed from the old common law conception of duress - threat to life and limb - and it has arrived at the modern generalisation expressed by Holmes J - 'subjected to an <b>improper</b> <b>motive</b> for action' (Fairbanks v Snow [...] ) ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike court {{proceedings}} where legal standards govern changes and judgments bring closure to issues, the PC process is open ended and continuous. For example, Massachusetts {{law requires that}} the party requesting a change to the visitation schedule show a material and substantial change in the circumstances and also that the requested change is necessary {{in the best interests}} of the child. No similar standards and limits apply to the PC process. As a result, one of the parents can repeatedly request meetings to change the schedule without satisfying any legal standards and to otherwise use the PC process to engage the other parent in unnecessary and constant conflict for <b>improper</b> <b>motives</b> and over the same resolved matters. The PC may not be motivated to stop such abuse because escalation and prolonging of the conflict would benefit the coordinator financially.|$|R
6000|$|The Swiss {{listened to}} all this attentively, and remarked that America had been much {{misrepresented}} in Europe, and that the opinion was then getting to be general in his country, from <b>improper</b> <b>motives.</b> He told me that a great deal had been said about the proceedings {{in the case of}} Rowland Stephenson, and he frankly asked me to explain them; for, being a commercial man, he admitted that injurious impressions had been made even on himself in relation to that affair. This was the third Swiss who had alluded to this subject, the other two instances occurring at Rome. In the latter cases, I understood pretty distinctly that there were reports current that the Americans were so desirous of obtaining rich emigrants, that they had rescued a criminal in order to reap the benefit of his gold! ...|$|R
2500|$|Svyret opposed {{proposals}} for the Limited Liability Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1997, which {{was sponsored by}} two UK accountants firms. During the debate, Syvret stated [...] "Senator Jeune has, {{in his capacity as}} President of the Policy and Resources Committee, used his influence to speed up the Law Drafting process and get this matter brought through. He has spoken on this matter in the House and at Committee meetings, even though he has a financial interest in this matter". Reginald Jeune was a founding partner in one of Jersey's largest law firms Mourant, du Feu & Jeune. [...] That firm was engaged by two accounting firms from the UK to assist them in getting this controversial law on the Statute book. Reginald Jeune had stood down as a partner for the law firm several years previously. It was not disputed that he was engaged as a Consultant by the law firm, and continued to have an office and secretary in the firms headquarters. He claimed {{that he did not know}} that his law firm was acting for Price Waterhouse, that his position in the law firm was an honorary one, and that his office and secretarial support from that law firm were to assist him in his States work. These claims were never investigated. The Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache, as presiding officer of the States assembly, subsequently wrote to Syvret, referring to the standing order which stated [...] "No Member shall impute <b>improper</b> <b>motives</b> to any other Member", saying [...] "you have not provided me with any evidence to justify those imputations", inviting Syvret to discuss the matter, and giving notice that matter would be put to the States assembly after the summer recess. At the States assembly on 3 September 1996, Syvret refused to withdraw his statement, and was not allowed to speak. Members voted by 36 to 3 (with 4 abstentions) in favour of the proposition [...] "That Mr. Syvret be suspended from the service of the States until he has withdrawn, by notice in writing to the Greffier, his imputations of <b>improper</b> <b>motives</b> against Senator Jeune". In an interview shortly afterwards, Syvret told The Observer, [...] "I was not allowed to defend myself. This is like something out of George Orwell's 1984.... I was not allowed to defend myself, to speak on my behalf". UK MP Austin Mitchell described the States of Jersey's conduct in the matter as that of a [...] "legislature for hire" [...] and he sponsored an Early Day Motion in the UK Parliament critical of Syvret's suspension. The States of Jersey subsequently agreed to set up a committee of inquiry into procedural matters relating to the drafting of the legislation. On 4 March 1997, Svyret returned to address the States assembly and stated that he alleged only that Senator Jeune had breached Standing Orders 43 and 44 of the States of Jersey. As Syvret had not alleged <b>improper</b> <b>motives</b> against Senator Jeune he therefore could not withdraw an allegation which he had not made; Syvret left the States meeting and the States then resolved to censure him but to lift his suspension. In April 1998, Michael Beloff QC, sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court, struck out legal proceedings brought by Syvret challenging the legality of his suspension from the States assembly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the legislature's internal procedures.|$|R
