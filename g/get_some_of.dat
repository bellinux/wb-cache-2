5|$|When {{the news}} of their plight reached the Parsis, who by this time had become quite prosperous, Parsi funds were set up to help the Iranian Zoroastrians and emissaries were {{dispatched}} to Iran. A Parsi philanthropist, Maneckji Limji Hataria, was sent to help them. He found only 7711 Zoroastrians in Kerman, Yazd and Tehran (now the capital of Iran). Using his influence with the British government he managed to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the repression against Zoroastrians removed. Jizya was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1882, when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.|$|E
5|$|When Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) demands £4000 {{for some}} goods he asked Anthony and Tyler to sell, Anthony says he only has £3000 as {{he needed to}} pay some bills. He agrees to sell a {{necklace}} to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the money, but instead, he gives it to Amira. He then gambles the rest but loses it. Derek then asks Anthony and Tyler to either pay up or steal cable from the railway, otherwise he will break their legs. Anthony goes to Michael for financial help but Michael locks Anthony {{in his office and}} calls the police, who arrest Derek and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who offered to help the brothers. They are released without charge, but Derek then accuses Anthony and Tyler of calling the police, and increases their debt to £8000. They realise Michael called the police and confront him, and his partner Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) discovers what is going on. She pays off the debt, but Michael takes a beating from Derek.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

Rangiaowhia riding was formed as one of 5 ridings in Waipa county in 1876, with Puniu River as its southern boundary. A state school near the hall ran from 1874 to 1939, when several schools were amalgamated into an expanded Te Awamutu school. The school house of about 1900 remains, as does the hall, built on the domain in 1907.|$|E
25|$|In the Chinese Market Mary meets Klarion the Witch boy, {{who tries}} to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her power. After Eclipso {{attempts}} to corrupt Mary, the Shadowpact take notice of Mary's activities, and attack Mary and Eclipso, who are overwhelmed and escape. Eclipso takes Mary to meet Darkseid, who offers to show her true darkness. Upon observing his treatment of people as mere puppets, Mary attacks him. An interruption by Desaad allows Mary to escape. Eclipso talks Mary into returning to Darkseid and submitting to his authority, suggesting that she can usurp his powers if she grows strong enough. The asteroid on which Mary and Eclipso are standing is destroyed by a stray shot from the Dominators and Monarch's armies. After Eclipso teleports her to safety, Mary blasts Eclipso with her own black diamond after realizing that Eclipso was only interested in selling her to Darkseid as a concubine in exchange for power. Eclipso manages to wrest the diamond from Mary's grasp, and leaves, telling her that she is once again alone. Eclipso then attempts to kill Mary, but finds that she is too strong. During their battle, Mary calls down the lightning, which strikes the two of them, causing Mary {{to fall into the}} ocean and wash up on the shores of Themiscyra.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E

Team-mate Ken Barnes described him as a player who was [...] "more about power than guile", and called him a [...] "born leader" [...] who was [...] "brilliant in the air". Paul's approach to captaincy was to ensure that every player gave as much effort as possible, mixing the respect of his colleagues with the occasional attempt to frighten them into action; in the tunnel prior to the 1956 FA Cup Final his last action before leading out his team was to hold up his fist and shout [...] "If we don't fucking win, you'll <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> this".|$|E

500|$|Bannon was 22years {{old when}} she began writing her first pulp novel. She was {{influenced}} by the only lesbian novels she had read, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall from 1928 and Vin Packer's Spring Fire from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel, but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of Spring Fire. Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them.

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{had first}} played Fillmore East in December 1969, opening for Blood, Sweat & Tears for three nights. Promoter Bill Graham enjoyed {{the band and}} promised to have them back soon. In January 1970, the band opened for Buddy Guy and B.B. King at San Francisco's Fillmore West, and one month later at Fillmore East {{supporting}} the Grateful Dead. According to biographer Alan Paul, [...] "these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts." [...] Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, [...] "You know, we get kind of frustrated doing the [...] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be... a live recording, to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> that natural fire on it." [...] "We were not intentionally trying to buck the system, but keeping each song down to 3:14 just didn't work for us," [...] remembered Gregg Allman.

500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where you <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E

Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named , the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue (the Draconequus statue that stood in the sculpture garden). But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony (as they previously did to defeat Nightmare Moon) to defeat Discord.
