It {{is based}} on an early work on fault-tolerant routing in dynamic 2 -D meshes [9] and 3 -D meshes [10] where faults occur during a routing process. Unlike many traditional models that assume all the nodes know global <b>fault</b> <b>information,</b> our approach {{is based on}} the concept of limited global <b>fault</b> <b>information.</b> First, a fault model called faulty block is used in which all faulty nodes in the system are contained in a set of disjoint faulty blocks. Then, the information of faulty block needs to be distributed to a limited number of nodes at the boundaries of faulty block to avoid a message entering a detour area. When new faults occur, faulty blocks need to be reconstructed and their <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> needs to be redistributed. In this case, the update of <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> and the routing process proceed hand-in-hand. During the converging period, the routing process may experience more detours with inconsistent information. We study the limited distribution of <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> in ¡-D meshes with dynamic faults. Our study shows that <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> can be distributed quickly to help the routing process. Therefore, the performance of routing process degrades gracefully in such a dynamic system...|$|E

The logical expressions of output signals of inverter power tube open-circuit faults is put forward and interrelated hardware circuit design is also elaborated. Delaying the rising edge of inverter power tube's pulse signal can effectively avoid the diagnosis error caused by the power tube's switching on/off.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a su cient {{condition}} for minimal routing in 3 -dimensional (3 -D) meshes with faulty nodes. It is based on an early work of the author on minimal routing in 2 -dimensional (2 -D) meshes. Unlike many traditional models that assume all the nodes know global fault distribution or just adjacent <b>fault</b> <b>information,</b> our approach is based on the concept of limited global <b>fault</b> <b>information.</b> First, we propose a fault model called faulty cube in which all faulty nodes in the system are contained in a set of faulty cubes. <b>Fault</b> <b>information</b> is then distributed to limited number of nodes while it is still su cient to support minimal routing. The limited <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> collected at each node is represented by avector called extended safety level. The extended safety level associated with a node can be used to determine the existence of a minimal path from this node to a given destination. Speci cally, we study the existence of minimal paths at a given source node, limited distribution of <b>fault</b> <b>information,</b> minimal routing, and deadlock-free and livelock-free routing.

First, each node {{collects}} precise <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> within distance-, and then <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> about nodes {{that are more}} than distance- away is coded in a special way. Specifically, in our approach, each node in a cube-based multicomputer of dimension is associated with an extended safety vector of bits. In the extended safety vector model, each node knows <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> within distance- 2; <b>fault</b> <b>information</b> outside distance- 2 is coded in a special way based on the coded information of its neighbors. The extended safety vector of each node can be easily calculated through I rounds of information exchanges among neighboring nodes. Therefore, each extended safety vector is an approximated measure of the number & distribution of faults in the neighborhood. Optimal unicasting between two nodes is guaranteed if the th bit of the safety vector of the source node is one, where is the Hamming distance between the source & destination nodes. In addition, the extended safety vector {{can be used as}} a navigation tool to direct a message to its destination through a minimal path.
