50|$|South African governments {{since the}} eighteenth century had enacted {{measures}} to restrict the flow of black South Africans into cities. Pass laws intended to control and direct their movement and employment were updated in the 1950s. Under the country's National Party government, black residents in urban districts were subject to influx control measures. Individuals over sixteen were required to carry passbooks, which contained an identity card, <b>employment</b> and influx <b>authorisation</b> from a labour bureau, name of employer and address, and details of personal history. Leading up to the Sharpeville massacre, the National Party administration {{under the leadership of}} Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd used these laws to enforce greater racial segregation and, in 1959-1960, extended them to include women. From the 1960s, the pass laws were the primary instrument used by the state to detain and harass its political opponents.|$|R
