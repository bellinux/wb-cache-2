We show that such a game with a discount factor has optimal value function and both players will have their optimal stationary strategies. The same result is proved for the case of a nondiscounted Markov game under some additional conditions, that is a reward rate function is nonnegative and the first time τ (<b>entrance</b> <b>time)</b> of the game process going to the stopped set is finite with probability one (i. e., p(τ < ∞) = 1).

In this paper we consider practical stabilization strategies of scalar linear systems by means of quantized feedback maps which use a minimal number of quantization levels.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} model assumed {{to govern the}} mobility of nodes in a mobile ad hoc network {{have been shown to}} significantly affect the network’s coverage, maximum throughput, and achievable throughput-delay tradeoffs. In this paper, we compare several mobility models, including the random walk, random waypoint and Manhattan models, {{on the basis of the}} number of states visited in a fixed time, the time to visit every state in a region, and the effect of the number of wandering nodes on the time to first entrance to a set of states. These metrics for a mobility model are useful for assessing the achievable event detection rates in surveillance applications where wireless-sensor-equipped vehicles are used to detect events of interest in a city. We also consider mobility models based on Correlated Random Walks, which can account for time dependency, geographical restrictions, and nonzero drift. We demonstrate that these models are analytically tractable by using a matrix-analytic approach to derive new, closed-form results in both the time- and transform-domains for the probability that a node is at any location at any time for both semi-infinite and finite one-dimensional lattices. We also derive first <b>entrance</b> <b>time</b> distributions for these walks. We find that a correlated random walk (i) covers more ground in a given amount of time and takes a smaller amount of time to cover an area completely than a random walk with the same average transition rate; (ii) has a smaller first <b>entrance</b> <b>time</b> to small sets of states than the random waypoint and random walk models and (iii) leads to a uniform distribution of nodes (except at the boundaries) in steady state.

The tracking device has constrained processing power and hence has to choose (1) a subregion to be observed out of a larger region in which the target motion takes place and (2) a finite resolution scale. As a consequence the variance of the best prediction of the location of the target becomes a random process. The tracking is satisfactory if the expected time it takes the variance process to enter a finite strip is finite. We determine the optimal choice of subregion and resolution and give conditions on the model that insure a satisfactory tracking procedure for this choice. In addition, using large deviation estimates for Bernoulli random walks, we obtain exponential bounds for the tail probabilities of the expected <b>entrance</b> <b>time</b> of the variance process...|$|E
