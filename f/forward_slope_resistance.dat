50|$|A {{defending}} unit {{usually does}} not conduct a reverse-slope defence along its entire front, as positioning {{troops on the}} <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> is necessary to control the region {{in front of the}} hill. However, when enemy forces are known to have superior long-range direct-fire or indirect-fire weapons, the majority of the defending force can use the hill to limit enemy observation and reduce the effectiveness of said long-range enemy fire. This tactic may even succeed in deceiving the enemy as to the true location and organisation of the main defensive positions. Typically, a smaller unit is still posted on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> to perform observation and delay attackers if the defending force needs to relocate its main body onto the <b>forward</b> <b>slope.</b> Otherwise, when the attacker advances and passes {{over the top of the}} hill, they may be ambushed by short-range fire from the defender on the reverse slope and perhaps on the counterslope (the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of a hill facing the reverse slope).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the effect of a <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seat on posture and muscular activity of the trunk and lower limbs. To this aim, twelve asymptomatic participants were tested in six conditions varying seat slope (0 °, 15 ° forward) and height (high, medium, low). Angular position of head, trunk and pelvis was assessed with an inertial orientation system, and muscular activity of 11 superficial postural muscles located in the trunk and lower limbs was estimated using normalized EMG. Results showed that a <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seat, compared to a flat seat, induced a greater activity of the soleus (p< 0. 01), vastus later-alis (p< 0. 05) and vastus medialis (p< 0. 05), as well a lower hip flexion (p< 0. 01). In contrast, no significant variation of head, trunk and pelvis angular position was observed according to seat slope. It was concluded that <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seats increase the load sustained by the lower limbs, without a systematic improvement of body posture...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The dark-adapted current-voltage (I-V) {{curve of}} a ventral {{photoreceptor}} cell of Limulus, {{measured by a}} voltage-clamp technique, has a high slope-resistance region more negative than resting voltage, a lower sloperesistance region between resting voltage and zero, and a negative sloperesistance region more positive than 0 v. With illumination, we find no unique voltage at {{which there is no}} light-induced current. At the termination of illumination, the I-V curve changes quickly, then recovers very slowly to a darkadapted configuration. The voltage-clamp currents during and after illumination can be interpreted to arise from two separate processes. One process (fast) changes quickly with change in illumination, has a reversal potential at + 20 mv, and has an I-V curve with positive <b>slope</b> <b>resistance</b> at all voltages. These properties are consistent with a light-induced change in membrane conductance to sodium ions. The other process (slow) changes slowly with changes in illumination, generates light-activated current at + 20 my, and has an I-V curve with a large region of negative <b>slope</b> <b>resistance.</b> The mechanism of this process cannot as yet be identified...|$|R
