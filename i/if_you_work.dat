James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that, Andy's Play' {{was the kind}} of strong, character driven episode I've missed from the show—not just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode, period." [...] Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode was a reminder of [...] "what has always been great about this show". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode [...] "worked largely because it embraced [...] idea" [...] that [...] "the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> with people long enough they can feel like your family." [...] He ultimately concluded that the episode was one that [...] "makes me happy [...] I spent an evening in the company of these goofballs." ...|$|E

In 2007, Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small {{recording}} studio in Queens, New York. Gaga was writing [...] "what would later become" [...] her debut studio album The Fame (2008) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists. Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train together {{to get to the}} studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became the first of several songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career. He states that he and Akon became good friends and writing partners. Akon gave Kelly a CD of working tracks as a basis for composition. From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ("Forgive Me"), Whitney Houston ("Like I Never Left", [...] "I Got You") and Michael Jackson ("Hold My Hand"). According to Kelly, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a [...] "symbol of how dreams come true <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> hard, and a constant reminder of how far I've come. I'm still extremely grateful for all that I've achieved".|$|E

500|$|Benfica began March with a {{visit to}} Estádio José Gomes, home of Estrela da Amadora. The local team scored first through Paulo Machado in the first half, but Benfica scored two goals in the second half; the latter in the 91st minute. On 8 March, Benfica played the return trip of the Champions League against Liverpool. The Rafael Benítez-led side needed to recoup a 1–0 {{disadvantage}} but Benfica won the match. A long-range shot from Simão in the 36th minute and a volley from Miccoli in the 89th minute put Benfica into the quarter-finals {{for the first time}} in 11 years, eliminating the reigning Champions League title holders in the process. Koeman was thrilled with the win, saying, [...] "This is why football is so nice—you can win against a bigger team, and anything is possible <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> for it". Four days later, on the same day they were drawn with Barcelona in the Champions League, Benfica hosted Naval at home. They failed to break Naval's resistance despite several attempts from Simão and dropped two points in a 0–0 draw. The draw threatened the hopes for a title renewal, as Porto and Sporting had distance themselves in the first two spots. On 15 March, Benfica suffered another setback at home. In the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal against Vitória de Guimarães, Benfica was surprised by the visitors and lost 1–0; the match's only goal was scored by Dário Monteiro. On 19 March, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Arcos to play Rio Ave. As with Estrela da Amadora, Benfica only secured the win in overtime, when Mantorras beat Mora with a 93rd-minute goal. Simão later told the press Benfica were still in the title race. Almost a week later, on the 25 March, Benfica hosted the fourth-place team Braga. The home team scored in their second attempt through Nuno Gomes and retained their slim lead until the end. Koeman was happy Benfica resolved the game so early, because in three days they met Barcelona. In the final game of March, Benfica faced Barcelona for the Champions League. Both goalkeepers were instrumental in securing a goalless draw; Moretto had the most work. Koeman was satisfied with the stalemate, predicting the second leg would be similar.|$|E

[...] "They use the giant corporate press rather than saying anything directly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as The New York Times saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA."

2500|$|After the June 5 sentencing, Walton {{said he was}} {{inclined}} to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Walton ordered Libby to report to prison while his attorneys appealed the conviction. [...] Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby {{that he would have}} 10 days to appeal the ruling. In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: [...] "Everyone is accountable, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general." [...] The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal. His [...] "order grant the [...] scholars permission to file their brief..." [...] contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion ... It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant. The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar questions arise in the cases that come before it." [...] Moreover, when the hearing started, [...] "in the interest of full disclosure," [...] Walton informed the court that he had [...] "received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages. Some wishing bad things on me and my family... hose types of things will have no impact... I initially threw them away, but then there were more, some that were more hateful... hey are being kept." ...|$|E
