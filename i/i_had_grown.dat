25|$|This time, {{however, the}} Bulgarians {{had decided to}} change the {{approach}} towards the Serbs. They summoned all Serbian župans {{to pay homage to}} Časlav, had them arrested and taken to Preslav. Serbia was annexed as a Bulgarian province, expanding the country's border to Croatia, which at the time had reached its apogee and proved to be a dangerous neighbour. The annexation was a necessary move since the Serbs had proved to be unreliable allies and Simeon <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> wary of the inevitable pattern of war, bribery and defection. According to Constantine VII's book De Administrando Imperio Simeon I resettled the whole population to the interior of Bulgaria and those who avoided captivity fled to Croatia, leaving the country deserted.|$|E
500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E

60|$|But at {{last the}} morning comes, and I find that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> into myself.|$|R
60|$|ALEEL. No, but you must. Seeing it cannot {{help her}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> tired of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Keswick, [...] "my {{parents died}} when I {{was quite a}} little fellow, and my aunt had charge of me until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up." ...|$|E
60|$|He turned {{towards me}} with a look upon his face which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to hate--a look calm and gentle enough, but full of {{resolution}} as unchanging as the mountains which towered above us.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was really}} grieved, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{to like the}} urbane old gentleman, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like the cantankerous old lady. In spite of his fussiness and his Stock Exchange views on the {{interpretation}} of Scripture, his genuine kindliness and his real liking for me had softened my heart to him; and my face must have shown my distress, for the pea-green young man added quickly with an afterthought: 'But you needn't be afraid, yah know. It's all right for Harold Tillington. You ought to know {{that as well as}} anyone--and bettah: for it was you who drew up his will for him at Florence.' ...|$|E
60|$|HE. Oh, I don't mind. I am past minding anything. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{too fast}} this evening.|$|R
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. How <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> {{hated her}} twenty minutes ago! But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{out of that}} now.|$|R

60|$|This offer did not {{altogether}} please me; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{very fond of}} Crowder, but the confidences of friends are often very embarrassing. At this moment the study door was gently opened, and Mrs. Crowder came in.|$|E
60|$|This {{tangle of}} my {{personal}} life, however, had {{not in the least}} affected my loyalty and duty to Vaughn Steele. Day by day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> more attached to him, keener in the interest of our work.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew that}} there was a {{discussion}} about the identity of the author of the Iliad. When at school I had been made to take down notes on the subject until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to loathe the very name of Homer.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth paused; 'possibly,' said she, 'in eyes, nose, and mouth; but, Helen, I do {{not think}} there ever could be anyone really like our mother; I was much {{too young to know}} all that she was whilst she was alive, but as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> older, and {{compared}} what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen of other people with what I recollect of her, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> certain that she must have been the most excellent, sensible, clever, kind, charming person that ever lived.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Our new {{acquaintance}} {{looking from}} one to the other of us declared: [...] "Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> so desperate that I'd have gone boldly up to the devil himself on the mere hint that he had a second mate's job to give away." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> accustomed, {{since my}} arrival at Sanstead House, {{to a certain}} {{quickening}} of the pace of life, but tonight events succeeded one another with a rapidity which surprised me. A whole cinematograph-drama was enacted during the space of {{time it takes for}} a wooden match to burn.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me a little doubtfully. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{into the habit of}} {{consulting}} her about my work, of reading most of it to her. Sometimes, too, she acted as my secretary. Perhaps she saw something of the trouble in my face, for she answered me very softly.|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Oh no. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> out of that. I {{love her}} now because she loved you, {{and because you}} love her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was most}} {{fortunate}} {{to get the}} house," [...] she answered. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to love it. Sometimes {{it seems as though}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always lived here." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{coloured}} {{slightly and}} pulled away her hands, laughing. [...] "Oh, indeed <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> old. The twilight is so kind it hides that, {{but it is}} true. Come into the house, Cuthbert. Father and Mother {{will be glad to}} see you." ...|$|R
60|$|We had no {{real need}} of a guide but I {{was glad to have}} Wolf Voice riding with me, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like him and welcomed any {{opportunity}} for conversing with him. He {{was one of the few}} full-bloods who could speak English well enough to enjoy a joke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never married, for all {{my heart}} was in the business, and I thought of nothing else. But a while ago a big {{consolidation}} of the canning industries was effected, and the active management I resigned to other hands, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> old, and had too much money already.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{speaking}} of the sea, if I remember," [...] he continued, like a man that was suddenly awakened from a deep reverie. [...] "Ay, I know it was of the sea; for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> boastful in my panegyrics: I had told you that this ship was faster than"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{call myself}} an Englishman," [...] Mr. Draconmeyer went on. [...] "I have made {{large sums of}} money in England, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to love England and English ways. Yet I came, as you know, from Berlin. The {{position}} which I hold in your city is still the position of president of the greatest German bank in the world. It is German finance which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> directed, and with German money <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made my fortune. To be frank with you, however, after these many years in London <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to feel myself very much of an Englishman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{rather more}} sensible. David set {{me to do}} stories for his lads, and, as he is dreadfully critical, it was very improving.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} along finely," [...] the Black Sheep would answer, [...] "for not one sheep {{in the pasture}} has so much wool as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{that man}} another man, {{who refused to}} see any one but Mr. Clemens, came to make me write to Washington about something. I saw him. I saw a third man, then a fourth. By {{this time it was}} noon. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> tired of keeping the list. I wished to rest.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} altogether mysterious about him--his connection with Mr. Ravenor and his manner towards myself. I was puzzled {{and more than}} half inclined to decide against the man whom personally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to detest. But, on the other hand, I was young and still an optimist with regard to my fellow-men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! At Blakely we were {{on terms}} of the most {{intimate}} friendship. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like and respect him more than any man I had ever met. I don't know exactly why I should take you so far into my confidence, but I am inclined to do so. Our friendship seemed likely to develop into--other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|ARJILLAX. Do you? Unfortunately for you, I am {{not still}} a child. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> out of cuddling. I can only {{appreciate}} your figure. Does that satisfy you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may think}} what you choose. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never implied to you by word or deed that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to think {{otherwise}} of him, and I never will. And I shall marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> lazy," [...] said Margaret, [...] "for I don't mind {{those things}} now. I am never sorry {{for a quiet}} time to {{recollect}} and consider." ...|$|R
