40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} in both psychology and economics documenting mistaken perceptions of randomness.

We further show that this <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> retail-game <b>sales</b> initially reflects an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> total <b>sales</b> at the retail and zip code level. Second, we show that the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> is persistent at the winning retailer. However, the data no not provide clear evidence that the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> at the zip code level is persistent. It thus appears that in the long run, consumers are persistent in their habit of buying lottery tickets at the "lucky" store; however, as the shock to total gambling dissipates, {{there is no evidence that}} lottery gambling itself is habit forming or addictive. ...|$|R
