5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could {{be used to make}} a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency,</b> such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} socio-technical systems {{approach}} {{is taken to}} examine how airline operational efficiency can be enhanced from a human factors perspective. Four case studies are examined from this viewpoint: <b>increasing</b> operating <b>efficiency</b> on the airport ramp; <b>increasing</b> <b>efficiency</b> through flight crew rostering; <b>increasing</b> <b>efficiency</b> by promoting direct routing; and <b>increasing</b> <b>efficiency</b> through greater flight deck automation. It is argued that the <b>increases</b> in operational <b>efficiency</b> (which is taken to be almost synonymous with cost) taking solely a human factors perspective will be minimal. To truly enhance operating efficiency the human component in any system cannot be examined in isolation from all other components...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{question}} of whether a refund <b>increases</b> <b>efficiency</b> in threshold public good games. New experimental evidence is presented on the effect of endowment size. We demonstrate that a refund <b>increases</b> <b>efficiency</b> if and only if the endowment is small relative to the threshold. We also propose a novel way to analyze the effect of a refund. Specifically, we argue that a refund <b>increases</b> <b>efficiency</b> only if significantly many groups converge towards zero contributions {{in the absence of a}} refund...|$|R

5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E
