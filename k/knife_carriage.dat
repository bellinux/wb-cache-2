40|$|A {{review of}} the recent Australian data {{indicates}} {{an increase in the}} use of knives for homicide offences, while their use decreased or remained steady in relation to robbery, sexual assault and kidnapping/ abduction. The limited academic research on this issue reveals two discrete groups—young people who carry knives and generally ‘grow out of it’; and an older cohort who are evidenced in crime and hospitalisation data. There were also differences between the <b>knife</b> <b>carriage</b> and use patterns of ‘school’ and ‘street’ youth. A detailed analysis of recent and proposed legislative and policy responses to knife crime in each Australian jurisdiction is presented; this demonstrates a diversity of approaches, especially in relation to penalties. By way of international comparison, the responses in the United Kingdom are considered and the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at tackling knife crime reviewed. The limited information available on the nature, extent, cause, motivation and possible growth of <b>knife</b> <b>carriage,</b> highlights the need for improved data collection, along with the development of clearer evidence for what works to reduce knife carrying and knife offences. Accordingly, the paper concludes by calling for better data collection, program evaluation and education campaigns.  ...|$|E
5000|$|Article 3, §1 of the 2006 Weapons Act {{lists the}} switchblade or {{automatic}} knife (couteaux à cran d’arrêt et à lame jaillissante), {{as well as}} butterfly knives, throwing knives, throwing stars, and knives or blades that have the appearance of other objects (i.e. sword canes, belt buckle knives, etc.) as prohibited weapons. [...] In addition to specifically prohibited knives, the police and local jurisdictions have broad authority to prohibit the carrying or possession {{of a wide variety}} of <b>knives,</b> to include <b>carriage</b> inside a vehicle, if the owner cannot establish sufficient legal reason (motif légitime) for doing so, particularly in urban areas or at public events. [...] This discretion extends to even folding knives without a locking blade.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to describe the prevalence and correlates of past-year weapon involvement among adolescents seeking care in an inner-city emergency department (ED). This cross-sectional study administered a computerized survey to all eligible adolescents (age 14 – 18 [*]years), 7 [*]days a week, who were seeking care over an 18 -month period at an inner-city Level[*] 1 ED. Validated measures were administered, including measures of demographics, sexual activity, substance use, injury, violent behavior, weapon carriage, and/or weapon use. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models were used to identify correlates of the occurrence and past-year frequency of these weapons variables. Adolescents (n[*]=[*] 2069, 86 % response rate) completed the computerized survey. Fifty-five percent were female; 56. 5 % were African American. In the past year, 20 % of adolescents reported <b>knife</b> or razor <b>carriage,</b> 7 % reported gun carriage, and 6 % pulled a knife or gun on someone. Although gun carriage was more frequent among males, females were as likely to carry a knife or pull a weapon in the past year. One-fifth of all adolescents seeking care in this inner-city ED have carried a weapon. Understanding weapon carriage among teens seeking ED care is a critical first step to future ED-based injury prevention initiatives.

6000|$|To {{the river}} Willems turned his eyes like a captive that looks fixedly {{at the door}} of his cell. If there was any hope in the world it would come from the river, by the river. For hours {{together}} he would stand in sunlight while the sea breeze sweeping over the lonely reach fluttered his ragged garments; the keen salt breeze that made him shiver now and then under the flood of intense heat. He looked at the brown and sparkling solitude of the flowing water, of the water flowing ceaseless and free in a soft, cool murmur of ripples at his feet. The world seemed to end there. The forests of the other bank appeared unattainable, enigmatical, for ever beyond reach like the stars of heaven--and as indifferent. Above and below, the forests on his side of the river came down to the water in a serried multitude of tall, immense trees towering in a great spread of twisted boughs above the thick undergrowth; great, solid trees, looking sombre, severe, and malevolently stolid, like a giant crowd of pitiless enemies pressing round silently to witness his slow agony. He was alone, small, crushed. He thought of escape--of something to be done. What? A raft! He imagined himself working at it, feverishly, desperately; cutting down trees, fastening the logs together and then drifting down with the current, down to the sea into the straits. There were ships there--ships, help, white men. Men like himself. Good men who would rescue him, take him away, take him far away where there was trade, and houses, and other men that could understand him exactly, appreciate his capabilities; where there was proper food, and money; where there were beds, <b>knives,</b> forks, <b>carriages,</b> brass bands, cool drinks, churches with well-dressed people praying in them. He would pray also. The superior land of refined delights where he could sit on a chair, eat his tiffin off a white tablecloth, nod to fellows--good fellows; he would be popular; always was--where he could be virtuous, correct, do business, draw a salary, smoke cigars, buy things in shops--have boots [...] . be happy, free, become rich. O God! What was wanted? Cut down a few trees. No! One would do. They used to make canoes by burning out a tree trunk, he had heard. Yes! One would do. One tree to cut down [...] . He rushed forward, and suddenly stood still as if rooted in the ground. He had a pocket-knife.|$|R
