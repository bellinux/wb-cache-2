50|$|Expression (21) is the {{classical}} {{transformation of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> and current densities. Since no length contraction of space itself is assumed, a finite volume element retains its numerical value of volume under a Galilean transformation, and since charge is assumed as an invariant quantity as well, charge density is invariant under a Galilean transformation. Currents result from charge densities in motion. Currents can arise even if the charge density is zero, since a charge density of one sign can move within a stationary charge density of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Thus {{it is necessary to}} include two charge densities (one positive, subscript P, the other negative, subscript N) in the calculation of the current density with each charge density having its own velocity (V) as measured from the rest frame of the ether.|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} decades, Kelvin probe force {{microscopy}} (KPFM) developed from a sidebranch of {{atomic force microscopy}} to a widely used standard technique. It allows to measure electrostatic potentials on any type of sample material with an unprecedented spatial resolution. While {{the technical aspects of}} the method are well understood, the interpretation of measured data remains object of intense research. This thesis intends to prove an advanced view on how sample systems which are typical for ultrahigh resolution imaging, such as organic molecular submonolayers on metals, can be quantitavily analysed with the <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> density model. In the first part a brief introduction into the Kelvin probe experiment and atomic force microscopy is given. A short review of the theoretical background of the technique is presented. Following, the <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> density model is introduced, which is used to further explain the origin of contrast in Kelvin probe force microscopy. Physical effects, which cause the occurence of local <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> densities, are reviewed for several sample systems that are of interest in high resolution atomic force microscopy. Experimental evidence for these effects is presented in the second part. Atomic force microscopy was used for in situ studies of a variety of sample systems ranging from pristine metal surfaces over monolayer organic adsorbates on metals to ferroelectric substrates both, with and without organic thin film coverage. As the result from these studies, it is shown that the <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> density model accurately describes the experimentally observed potential contrasts. This implies an inherent disparity of the measurement results between the different Kelvin probe force microscopy techniques; a point which had been overseen so far in the discussion of experimental data. Especially for the case of laterally strong confined <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> densities, the results show the opportunity as well as the necessity to explain experimental data with a combination of ab initio calculations of the <b>differential</b> <b>charge</b> density and an electrostatic model of the tip-sample interaction...|$|E

Potential barriers can be formed by <b>differential</b> <b>charging</b> on the spacecraft or by the presence of space charge. The stringent electrostatic cleanliness specifications imposed on ISEE made the presence of <b>differential</b> <b>charging</b> seem unlikely, if these precautions were effective. Modeling of the event to determine if the barrier was produced by the presence of space charge suggested that this could not explain the observed barrier.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of spacecraft charging in sunlight. The daylight photoelectron flux emitted from spacecraft surfaces normally exceeds the ambient electron flux. As a result, charging of spacecraft surfaces to positive voltage is expected to occur in sunlight. Indeed, spacecraft are often observed to charge to low positive voltages in sunlight. However, spacecraft can charge to high-level (kiloelectronvolts) negative voltages in sunlight. Why do spacecraft charge negatively in sunlight? One chief reason concerns <b>differential</b> <b>charging</b> between the sunlit and dark sides. For a satellite with dielectric surfaces, an electric field builds up on the shaded surfaces and then wraps around to the sunlit side to form a potential barrier that suppresses the photoemission. A monopole–dipole (for zero spin) or monopole–quadrupole model (for fast spin) describes the <b>differential</b> <b>charging</b> potential distribution due to blocked photoelectrons.
