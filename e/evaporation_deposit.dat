40|$|Observations {{of stellar}} kinematics, gas {{dynamics}} and masers around galactic nuclei have now firmly established that many galaxies host central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses {{in the range}} 10 ^ 6 ∼ 10 ^ 9 M_. However, how these SMBHs formed is not well understood. One reason for this situation {{is the lack of}} observations of intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs), which could bridge the gap between stellar-mass BHs and SMBHs. Recently, this missing link (i. e., an IMBH) has been found in observations made by the ASCA and the Chandra of the central region of the starburst galaxy M 82 MT 99, PG 99, MT 01, Ka 01. Subsequent observations by SUBARU have revealed that this IMBH apparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. Based on these findings, we suggest a new formation scenario for SMBHs. In this scenario, IMBHs first form in young compact star clusters through runaway merging of massive stars. While these IMBHs are forming, the host star clusters sink toward the galactic nucleus through dynamical friction, and upon <b>evaporation</b> <b>deposit</b> their IMBHs near the galactic center. The IMBHs then form binaries and eventually merge via gravitational radiation, forming an SMBH. Comment: 12 pages 2 figuresm submitted to Astrophysical Journal, Letter...|$|E

The microscopy also shows a homogeneous morphological surface of the PVD film at macro and micro scales, with molecular aggregates at nanoscale. Besides, the PVD film roughness does not follow substrate roughness. The X-ray diffraction indicates a crystalline structure for PhPTCD powder and an amorphous form for PhPTCD PVD film.

It also may be due to domestic waste discharge and effluents that may be coming out through the Wadies channel. The salts of sodium, potassium and calcium contribute chloride in water. The large contents of chloride in freshwater is an indicator of pollution (Venkatasubramani and Meenambal 2007). The high chloride concentration levels in water contribute to deteriorate on the domestic plumbing, water heaters and municipal water words equipment. Sulphate may enter natural waters through weathering of sulphide-bearing or by direct dissolution of <b>evaporation</b> <b>deposits.</b> Another significant source to water systems is airborne pollutants containing oxides of sulphur, which convert to sulphuric acid in precipitation. Sulphate is of great importance in public water supplies because of its cathartic effect upon humans when it is present in excessive amounts.

River biofilms {{are the first}} aquatic non-target organisms which interact with pesticides. Therefore, ecotoxicological experiments were performed at laboratory scale under controlled conditions to investigate the community-level responses of river biofilms to a chloroacetanilide herbicide (alachlor) and organic solvent (methanol) exposure through the development referenced to control. Triplicate rotating annular bioreactors, inoculated with river water, were used to cultivate river biofilms {{under the influence of}} 1 and 10  μg L− 1 of alachlor and 25  mg L− 1 of methanol. For this purpose, functional (thymidine incorporation and carbon utilization spectra) and structural responses of microbial communities were assessed after 5  weeks of development. Structural aspects included biomass (chlorophyll a, confocal laser scanning microscopy) and composition (fluor-conjugated lectin binding, molecular fingerprinting, and diatom species composition). The addition of alachlor resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial biomass at 1  μg L− 1, whereas at 10  μg L− 1, it induced a significant reduction of exopolymer lectin binding, algal, bacterial, and cyanobacterial biomass. However, there were no changes in biofilm thickness or thymidine incorporation. No significant difference between the bacterial community structures of control and alachlor-treated biofilms was revealed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses. However, the methanol-treated bacterial communities appeared different from control and alachlor-treated communities. Moreover, methanol treatment resulted in an increase of bacterial biomass and thymidine incorporation as well. Changes in dominant lectin binding suggested changes in the exopolymeric substances and community composition. Chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial biomass were also altered by methanol. This study suggested that the concentration-dependent effect of alachlor mainly remains limited to biomass and growth inhibition without apparent changes of structural and functional characteristics measured.

Here the oxidation behavior of ZrB 2 -SiC composites at temperatures between 1500 - 1900 ºC is studied. The {{structure and composition}} of complex oxide scales, formed at these temperatures, are characterized using microstructural and elemental analysis. A novel method, called the Ribbon Method, was developed for testing UHTCs at high temperatures, rapidly at low cost. Self-supported UHTC ribbon specimens are resistively heated with a table-top apparatus to achieve temperatures from 900 - 2000 ºC. The Ribbon Method is a novel method for rapid oxidation characterization of UHTC at xxi high temperatures and a valuable alternative to the current high temperature facilities for UHTCs. Oxidation studies with the Ribbon Method showed that a SiO 2 rich borosilicate surface layer forms during the oxidation of the ZrB 2 -SiC composite and acts as a protective barrier at lower temperatures by hindering oxygen diffusion through the surface layer. The SiO 2 -rich surface layer starts to volatilize extensively at temperatures above 1700 ºC resulting in a decreases in the oxidation resistance of the composite. A novel mechanism is proposed for the high temperature oxidation of ZrB 2 -SiC based composites. This mechanism is based on liquid transport of oxide liquid solution formed during oxidation at temperatures around 1550 ºC. Patterns in borosilicate surface layer of oxidized ZrB 2 -SiC composites were discovered, showing evidence of liquid flow in the oxide film.

In this work, the formation of deposits during the drying of nanoliter colloidal drops on a flat substrate is investigated numerically and experimentally. A finite-element numerical model is developed that solves the Navier-Stokes, heat and mass transport equations in a Lagrangian framework. The diffusion of vapor in the atmosphere is solved numerically, providing an exact boundary condition for the evaporative flux at the droplet-air interface. Laplace stresses and thermal Marangoni stresses are accounted for. The particle concentration is tracked by solving a continuum advection-diffusion equation. Wetting line motion and the interaction of the free surface of the drop with the growing deposit are modeled based on criteria on wetting angles. Numerical results for evaporation times and flow field are in very good agreement with published experimental and theoretical results. We also performed transient visualization experiments of water and isopropanol drops loaded with polystyrene microsphere evaporating on respectively glass and polydimethylsiloxane substrates. Measured <b>evaporation</b> times, <b>deposit</b> shape and sizes, and flow fields are in very good agreement with the numerical results. Different flow patterns caused by the competition of Marangoni loops and radial flow are shown to determine the deposit shape to be either a ring-like pattern or a homogeneous bump...|$|R
40|$|Chalcogenide glasses have {{a variety}} of unique optical {{properties}} due to the intrinsic structural flexibility and bonds metastability. They are desirable materials for many applications, such as infrared communication sensors, holographic grating, optical imaging, and ultrafast nonlinear optic devices. Here, we introduce a novel electron-beam <b>evaporation</b> process to <b>deposit</b> the good quality arsenic trisulfide (As 2 S 3) films and then the As 2 S 3 films were used to fabricate the As 2 S 3 waveguides with three approaches. The first method is photoresist lift-off. Because of the restriction of thermal budget of photoresist, the As 2 S 3 film must be deposited at the room temperature. The second one is the silicon dioxide lift-off process on sapphire substrates, in which the As 2 S 3 film could be evaporated at a high temperature (> 180  °C) for better film quality. The third one is the plasma etching process with a metal protective thin layer in the pattern development process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ArF {{excimer laser}} {{is the main}} light {{resource}} for the microlithography technology. In the laser cavity, the optical components with lowest absorption and scattering loss are necessary. As a consequence only a few materials are promising candidates for 193 nm coatings with high transmittance or high reflectance. Fluoride films exhibit relatively low optical loss as well as high laser induced damage thresholds. The potentiality of LaF 3 and MgF 2 is evaluated in respect of the production of improved optical coatings for applications. For this purpose, single layer is prepared by thermal <b>evaporation</b> at the <b>deposited</b> temperatures of 523 K on Fused Silica. A first order bulk inhomogeneity model for extracting the optical constants of weak absorbing film is applied, {{which is based on}} spectrophotometry. Refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of the optimal LaF 3 film are 1. 678 and 2. 24 × 10 - 3 at 193 nm. In the case of the optimal MgF 2 film, n and k are 1. 44...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: LiFePO 4 /C-Ge {{electrodes}} {{were prepared}} with vacuum thermal <b>evaporation</b> deposition by <b>depositing</b> Ge films on as-prepared LiFePO 4 /C electrodes. The effect of Ge {{film on the}} electrochemical performances of LiFePO 4 /C cells was investigated systematically by charge/discharge testing, cyclic voltammograms and AC impedance spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that Ge-film-surface modified LiFePO 4 /C showed excellent electrochemical performances {{compared to that of}} the pristine one in terms of cyclability and rate capability. At 60 ℃, LiFePO 4 /C-Ge film exhibited outstanding cyclability with less than 5 % capacity fade after 50 cycles while the pristine one suffers 15 %. Analysis from the electrochemical measurements showed that the presence of Ge film on the LiFePO 4 /C electrode would protect active material from HF generated by the decomposition of LiPF 6 in the electrolyte and stabilize the surface structure of active material during the charge and discharge cycle. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicated that Ge film mainly reduced the charge transfer resistance Rct of LiFePO 4 /C electrode, resulting from the suppression of the solid electrolyte interfacial (SEI) film...|$|R
