The Lunar Prodigy® system uses a bilateral foot-positioning tool with a fixed <b>interpedal</b> width. The aim of this study was to determine whether the small degrees of femur abduction and adduction introduced by a fixed <b>interpedal</b> width-positioning tool influences the femur bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Two-hundred patients had the total femur (FTot), femoral neck (FN), femoral shaft (FS), and femoral trochanter (FT) BMD, and angles of femoral abduction and adduction measured. Of all subjects, 26. 5 % had an absolute difference in femur angulation of # 1 °, 77. 5 % had # 5 ° and 97 % had # 10 °. There was no significant correlation between the right-to-left differences in femur angles and the absolute right-to-left differences in FTot, FN, FS, and FT BMD. The introduction of small degrees of femur angulation with the fixed <b>interpedal</b> width bilateral foot positioner does not significantly affect the measured BMD at the various femur region...|$|E

Our analyses involved a detailed examination of Epiperipatus biolleyi from Costa Rica, Eoperipatus sp. from Thailand, and a new onychophoran species and genus from Costa Rica, Principapillatus hitoyensis gen. et sp. nov [...] Scanning electron microscopy on embryos and specimens of varying age revealed novel morphological characters and character states, including the distribution of different receptor types along the antennae, the arrangement and form of papillae on the head, body and legs, the presence and shape of <b>interpedal</b> structures and fields of modified scales on the ventral body surface, the arrangement of lips around the mouth, the number, position and structure of crural tubercles and anal gland openings, and the presence and shape of embryonic foot projections. Karyotypic analyses revealed differences in the number and size of chromosomes among the species studied. The results of our phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial COI and 12 S rRNA gene sequences are in line with morphological and karyotype data. However, our data show a large number of unexplored, albeit informative, characters in the Peripatidae. We suggest that analysing these characters in additional species would help unravel species diversity and phylogeny in the Onychophora, and tha...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first of two {{describing}} how soil macromorphological and chemical data can be combined with a minimum of hydrological data to distinguish between, and to quantify, past and present hydrological processes. These processes are relevant to both waterlogging and dryland salinity. The purpose of this first paper is to establish a methodological framework. It also describes the initial interpretation of the macromorphological features of the toposequence studied at Gatum on the Dundas Tablelands in western Victoria. A modified version of the soil feature¿system¿domain grouping method was used. Macromorphological data combined with only limited piezometric data showed that: (1) The soil feature¿system¿domain grouping method makes it possible to distinguish between the effects of past and present hydrological processes on soil macromorphology at Gatum. (2) Waterlogging of the surface horizons at Gatum is often caused by perching of soil water within the B-horizon (as opposed to on top of the B-horizon). Changes in soil structure and in colour of cutans and mottles can be an indicator of this first restricting layer. (3) It is likely that <b>interpedal</b> cracks and old tree root holes act as preferred paths for water to flow through this first restricting layer. (4) A second fresh perched water table can occur on top of the pallid zone. Where the pallid zone reaches close to the surface the two perched water tables may merge and cause a local increase in waterlogging, as indicated by local soil morphology. When this occurs, hillside seeps can occur quite high up on the slopes, even when there is no apparent irregularity in surface topography. 5) The permanent saline water table occurs on top of the bedrock and causes salting problems where it comes too close to the soil surface. Salting problems {{at the bottom of a}} slope are more severe where fresh perched water tables increase waterlogging On the basis of these findings the suitability of various management options to reduce waterlogging and salinisation is discussed. Further findings regarding restricting layers, flow paths through the soils, and relations between duration of saturation and soil morphological features, are discussed in a companion paper (by J. Brouwer and R. W. Fitzpatrick, pp. 927 - 946 in this issue) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second of two {{describing}} how soil macromorphological and chemical data can be combined with soil hydrological data to distinguish between, and to quantify, past and present hydrological processes relevant to waterlogging and dryland salinity. The first paper provides a methodological framework for the study, and describes the initial interpretation of the macromorphological features of the toposequence studied, using the soil feature-system-domain grouping method. This second paper deals with the added value of extensive piezometric and other hydrological observations relative to soil macromorphological studies, and with quantitative relationships between soil colour and duration of waterlogging. As with the first paper, this paper focuses on a soil toposequence at Gatum on the eastern Dundas Tableland in western Victoria. For the the broad crest with yellow gradational soils or Dermosols (Plinthoxeralfs), the hydrological data confirmed the conclusion from macromorphological observations that: (1) There are three levels at which downward flow of water is restricted: {{at the top of}} the largely unaltered mottled zone, that is at 0. 8 - 1. 0 m depth, well below the top of the yellow Bt 1 -horizon (fresh water); {{at the top of the}} pallid zone, at about 3 - 3. 5 m depth (fresh water); and on top of the unweathered ignimbrite (saline water). (2) Below about 30 mm depth, down at least as far as 2. 0 m and sometimes even more, the major pathways for downward movement of water are indeed root channels, with or without live roots, and not <b>interpedal</b> cracks. The 3 -dimensional spacing of the rootholes above and through the less-permeable mottled zone, and the (horizontal) conductivity, storage capacity, and thickness of overlying horizons determine the extent of ponding, runoff, and deep infiltration taking place. In addition, the hydrological observations showed that: (3) If rainfall is regular, well-spaced, and not excessive, ponding is unlikely to take place even where there is a rainfall surplus and there are layers restricting downward flow of water. Furthermore, along the toposequence with yellow duplex soils or Dermosols, Chromosols, and Hydrosols, (4) There were generally good correlations between duration of saturation at the bottom of the E-horizon and colour aspects of the E-horizon (value and chroma of the matrix) and of the B 2 -horizon (hue, value, and chroma of the matrix). Based on these findings additional suggestions are made for improving identification and management of water logging and salinisation processe...|$|E
40|$|Soils often {{exhibit a}} variety of {{small-scale}} heterogeneities such as cracks, inter-aggregate (or structural) pores, decayed root channels {{and other types of}} macro- and coarse micropores. Due to these local-scale heterogeneities, a non-ideality known as ‘Preferential Flow’ generally occurs, creating localscale non-equilibrium conditions in pressure head and solute concentrations between regions of faster and slower flow. According to Gerke (2006), “preferential flow comprises all phenomena where water and solutes move along certain pathways, while bypassing other volume fractions of the porous soil matrix. ” Preferential flow is not only a theoretical challenge, but also has practical significance in that it enhances the leaching of pollutants from the surface to deeper layers and into the saturated groundwater zone. The reason is that the buffer capacity, as well as biological activity, that are found in the organic-rich upper soil horizons and that are vital to the degradation of pollutants, are generally weaker or absent altogether in the deeper layers. Thus the danger of groundwater contamination is increased due to preferential flow. The theoretical foundation for the phenomenon of preferential flow was laid half a century ago by Barenblatt et al. (1960). The theory was initially formulated in terms of the seepage of liquids in fissured rocks. The profound importance of cracks and fissures was highlighted by Freeze and Cherry (1979), who found that “the hydraulic conductivity through crack network is often 10 to 104 times higher than that of the adjacent rock matrix. ” The theory was later expanded by soil physicists to apply to porous media containing cracks or macropores. The first step was the introduction of the concept of mobile and immobile water in a porous medium by Gaudet et al. (1977). This was followed by Beven and Germann (1981, 1982), who formulated the theory of flow in soils containing macropores. The fundamental problem of disequilibrium due to macroporosity was discussed by Baveye and Sposito (1984). The theorywas later extended, using numerical approaches, to the concept of dual porosity (Moench, 1984; Arbogast, 1987), and specialized for soils by Gerke and van Genuchten (1993). Nkedi-Kizza et al. (1983) studied ion-exchange and miscible displacement in aggregated soils. Othmer et al. (1991) demonstrated that for soils with bimodal porosity, the numerical simulation improved when both hydraulic functions, soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, were included into separate pore domains of the model. Another advance was the dual permeability concept by Šimůnek et al. (2003). Recent advances in preferential flow research were reviewed by Jarvis (1998) and Gerke (2006). Accounting for themechanismsinvolved,we distinguish the following types of preferential flowat the ‘pedon scale’ (i. e. the scale of larger units of soil particles formed by aggregation) : 1. Preferential flowin realmacropores (or non-capillary pores). At least in principle, Richards' equation is not applicable. Instead, the kinematic wave equation or the simple Hagen– Poiseuille equation can be applied. Fluxes are significantly accelerated compared to those in the pores. 2. Preferential flow in inter-aggregate pores, denoted also as <b>interpedal</b> or structural pores. Sometimes inter-aggregate pores are described as macropores, but this terminology neglects the principal difference between non-capillary and capillary pores. Richards' equation is applicable since the pores are in the category of capillary pores. The fluxes are accelerated compared to those in the intrapedal pores of the matrix when infiltration and redistribution are considered, but less accelerated compared to the fluxes in Type 1. Some authors question the applicability of Richards' equation in those coarser micropores. 3. Fingering due to the instability on the wetting front. This occurs most frequently at the interface of a less permeable layer above a more permeable one. In numerical models, apparent fingering can be induced by numerical instabilities. Fluxes are comparable to those of Type 2. 4. Preferential flow due to spatial irregularities or temporal dynamics in soil wettability (or water repellency). This type of preferential flow is often assumed to occur when the initial soilwater content is belowa critical value. Fluxes are comparable to those of Type 2. Local-scale heterogeneities and non-equilibrium preferential flow are obviously expected to be strongly related, but the quantification of this relationship remains a challenge. Given the important effects of preferential flow on water and solute transport, a large body of literature can be found dealing with the description of preferential-flow pore networks and the mechanisms of macropore flow, especially at the pedon scale. The use of morphometric data in combination with soil physical characteristics is recognized as particularly relevant. Recent advances allow the complex geometry of the pore space to be quantified by means of tomography, magnetic resonance and image analysis. New devices and measurement techniques are now available, such as time domain reflectometry and disc permeametry, allowing better observations of preferential flow at the pedon scale. Additionally, insight into the physical influence of local-scale heterogeneities on soil processes can now be gained by appropriately modelling water and solute transport behavior in natural soils with different structures. Accordingly, the body of knowledge on preferential flow available at present, both theoretical and experimental, is extensive. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps still exist. The purpose of this Special Issue is to fill some of these gaps. The papers selected for the Special Issue address a range of issues, from the basic principles governing the generation of preferential flow at the pore scale, to the flow mechanisms and the microscale properties of the porous soil system, and to the problem of upscaling. The papers show that better observations using new devices, and analyzed using innovative analytical and predictive approaches, may bring us toward a better understanding and prediction of preferential flow in structured soils. The Special Issue starts with a comprehensive two-paper overviewon model applications in preferential flow/transport in structured soils by Koehne et al., one paper on water flow and tracer transport, and the other on pesticide transport. These papers describe the present state of the art. Preferential flow in real macropores (or non-capillary pores), and preferential flow in <b>interpedal</b> (inter-aggregate) pores is investigated in two papers, one by Kutílek and Germann, and another by Hincapié and Germann. The limits of applicability of Richards' equation as a function of pore size, and the fluxes involved, are investigated in these papers. Recent mechanistic approaches for interpreting transport in heterogeneous soils are presented in four papers: Coppola, Comegna et al.; Kutílek et al.; Gerke and Badorrek; and Kodešová et al. All of these authors make use of experimental evidence for testing the validity and assessing {{the pros and cons of}} the various alternative approaches. In the papers by Coppola, Comegna et al. and by Kutílek et al., the simpler but approximate composite porosity (bimodal porosity) approaches are discussed. Although composite porosity approaches can account for a fast propagation of the wetting front, they implicitly assume instantaneous equilibrium between pore systems. Non-equilibrium flow is accounted for in the paper by Gerke and Badorrek, as well as in that by Kodešová et al., where the more complex double-permeability models are applied. The first paper analyzes the effects of local heterogeneities on preferential flow in a lignitic mine. The second paper investigates the relationships between preferential flow and soil properties at the soil profile scale, as well as the influence of solute characteristics and soil management practices on preferential pore flow. Two papers, one by Sander and Gerke, and the other by Rosenbom et al., present new advances in the understanding of preferential flow that have resulted from the use of novel experimental techniques, as well as two-dimensional modelling that also takes horizontal flow/transport into account. The latter uses a powerful 3 D model for variably saturated flow and transport. Finally, in the last paper, Coppola, Basile et al. consider the important applied research issue of upscaling by investigating the influence of physical heterogeneities and preferential pathways on flow and transport processes across spatial scales and related scale-dependent parameterizations in laband field-scale transport experiments. Although the work presented here is far from comprehensive, and although many more questions remain, we hope the reader will enjoy reading this modest volume and will agree that it has advanced the general understanding of preferential flow in a significant way...|$|E
