40|$|Wind power {{parallel}} operation {{is an effective}} way to realize the large scale use of wind power, but the fluctuations of power output from wind power units may have great influence on power quality, hence a new method of power smoothing and capacity optimized allocation based on hybrid energy storage technology is proposed in terms of the uncontrollable and unexpected characteristics of wind speed in wind farms. First, power smoothing based on a traditional <b>Inertial</b> <b>Filter</b> is introduced and the relationship between the time constant, its smoothing effect and capacity allocation are analyzed and combined with Proportional Integral Differential (PID) control to realize power smoothing control of wind power. Then wavelet theory is adopted to realize a multi-layer decomposition of power output in some wind farms, a power smoothing model based on hybrid energy storage technology is constructed combining the characteristics of the Super Capacitor (SC) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) technologies. The hybrid energy storage system is available for power fluctuations with high frequency-low energy and low frequency-high energy to achieve good smoothing effects compared with a single energy storage system. The power fluctuations filtered by the Wavelet Transform is regarded as the target value of BESS, the charging and discharging control for battery is completed quickly by Model Algorithm Control (MAC). Because of the influence of the inertia and the response speed of the battery, its actual output is not completely equal to the target value which mainly reflects in high-frequency part, the difference part uses SC to compensate and makes the output of battery and SC closer to the target value on the whole. Compared with the traditional <b>Inertial</b> <b>Filter</b> and PID control method, the validity of the model was verified by simulation results.

The latter filter is far more advanced, where the estimated state includes the 3 D attitude, 3 D position and 3 D velocity as well as the accelerometer and gyroscope offsets for each sensor axis. For the TC EKF architectures one also includes the receiver clock offset and offset rate to the filter state to be estimated. As the measurements we employ C/A L 1 code and Doppler shift, where for loosely-coupled approaches, the solutions from external to KF snapshot solvers (position or velocity) are used as a direct observation of the state.

40|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} {{statistics}} of both individual inertial particles and inertial particle pairs in direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence {{in the absence}} of gravity. The effect of the Taylor microscale Reynolds number R_λ on the particle statistics is examined over the largest range to date (from R_λ = 88 - 597). We first explore the effect of preferential sampling on the single-particle statistics, and use our understanding of preferential sampling to provide a physical explanation for many of the trends in the particle velocity gradients, kinetic energies, and accelerations at low St. As St increases, <b>inertial</b> <b>filtering</b> effects become more important, causing the particle kinetic energies and accelerations to decrease. We then consider particle-pair statistics, and focus our attention on the relative velocities and radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the particles. The relative velocity statistics indicate that preferential-sampling effects are important for St ≲ 0. 1 and that path-history/non-local effects become increasingly important for St ≳ 0. 2. The lower-order relative velocity statistics are only weakly sensitive to changes in Reynolds number at low St. We find that the RDFs peak near St of order unity, that they exhibit power-law scaling for low and intermediate St, and that they are largely independent of Reynolds number for low and intermediate St. We also observe that at large St, changes in the RDF are related to changes the scaling exponents of the relative velocity variances. The particle collision kernel is found to be largely insensitive to the flow Reynolds number, suggesting that relatively low-Reynolds-number simulations may be able to capture much of the relevant physics of droplet collisions and growth in the adiabatic cores of atmospheric clouds.

The (2) systems provide hourly surface currents, with 5 km spatial resolution and a radial coverage lying close to 180 km. The detailed and quantitative description of the spatial patterns observed by the HF radar offers new evidence on the main ocean processes, at different time scales, affecting a study area where surface currents show marked temporal and spatial variability. A clear seasonality in terms of sea surface currents and along-slope circulation is observed, with cyclonic and anticyclonic patterns during the winter and summer months, respectively. From the analysis of low-pass filtered currents, {{a key component of}} this seasonal variability is associated with the surface signature of the slope current (Iberian Poleward Current (IPC)). Clearly intensified over {{the upper part of the}} slope, this current circulates eastward off the Spanish coast and northward over the French shelves in winter.
