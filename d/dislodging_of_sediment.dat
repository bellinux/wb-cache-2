40|$|The {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> by a fluid {{along the}} surface is responsible for dune formation, dust entrainment and for a rich diversity of patterns {{on the bottom of}} oceans, rivers, and planetary surfaces. Most previous models <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> transport have focused on the equilibrium (or saturated) particle flux. However, the morphodynamics <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> landscapes emerging due to surface transport <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> is controlled by situations out-of-equilibrium. In particular, it is controlled by the saturation length characterizing the distance it takes for the particle flux to reach a new equilibrium after a change in flow conditions. The saturation of mass density of particles entrained into transport and the relaxation of particle and fluid velocities constitute the main relevant relaxation mechanisms leading to saturation <b>of</b> the <b>sediment</b> flux. Here we present a theoretical model for sediment transport which, for the first time, accounts for both these relaxation mechanisms and for the different types <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> entrainment prevailing under different environmental conditions. Our analytical treatment allows us to derive a closed expression for the saturation length <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> flux, which is general and can thus be applied under different physical conditions...|$|R

In addition, because the source <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> (i.e. land, ocean, or organically) is often correlated with how coarse or fine sediment grain sizes that characterize an area are on average, grain size distribution <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> will shift according to relative input of land (typically fine), marine (typically coarse), and organically-derived (variable with age) sediment.
