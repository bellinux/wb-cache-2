He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the <b>European</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> in 1973.|$|E

At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the <b>European</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market,</b> which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E

Enlargements also entails the adoption of <b>common</b> <b>market</b> institutions and legislation for the new entrants.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects on pricing {{behavior}} of firms in a transition economy resulting from integration into the <b>European</b> Union's <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> and changes in ownership. We use a semiparametric model with a rich panel of manufacturing firms in Romania from 1995 to 2003 to estimate firm-level markups. We find that markups are higher in more concentrated industries and less exposed to foreign competition. Trade integration appears to generally increase competitive pressure on markups. Industries exposed to more international competition experience a larger change in markups following integration into the <b>European</b> Union's <b>Common</b> <b>Market.</b> However, as the initial impact of tariff reduction fades away, higher markups become {{an important element in}} firms' pricing strategies. We also find that foreign firms and private domestic firms charge significantly higher markups on average than state-owned enterprizes. Tariff barriers Markups Transition Semiparametric...|$|R
