40|$|We {{found that}} mannitol- 1 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (MtlD), {{a component of}} the mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system, is required for <b>glucitol</b> assimilation in addition to GutR, GutB, and GutP in Bacillus subtilis. Northern hybridization of total RNA and microarray studies of RNA from cells cultured on glucose, mannitol, and <b>glucitol</b> indicated that mannitol as the sole carbon source induced hyperexpression of the mtl operon, whereas <b>glucitol</b> induced both mtl and gut operons. The B. subtilis mtl operon consists of mtlA (encoding enzyme IICBAmt 1) and mtlD, and its transcriptional regulator gene, mtlR, is located 14. 4 kb downstream from the mtl operon on the chromosome. The mtlA, mtlD, and mtlR mutants disrupted by the introduction of the pMUTin derivatives MTLAd, MTLDd, and MTLRd, respectively, could not grow normally on either mannitol or <b>glucitol.</b> However, the growth of MTLAd on <b>glucitol</b> was enhanced by IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). This mutant has an IPTG-inducible promoter (Pspac promoter) located in mtlA, and this site corresponds to the upstream region of mtlD. Insertion mutants of mtlD harboring the chloramphenicol resistance gene also could not grow on either mannitol or <b>glucitol.</b> In contrast, an insertion mutant of mtlA could grow on <b>glucitol</b> but not on mannitol in {{the presence or absence of}} IPTG.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{region of}} the Bacillus subtilis <b>glucitol</b> dehydrogenase (gutB) gene was divided into three subregions: a promoter, an upstream positive regulatory region, and a downstream negative regulatory region. Data from primer extension, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis analyses were consistent with two possible models for the gutB promoter. It is either a rA_type promoter with an unusually short spacer region (15 bp) or a special e 4 promoter which requires only the hexameric- 10 sequence for its function. Sequence carrying just the promoter region (from- 48 to + 6) failed to direct transcription in vivo. An upstream regulatory sequence was essential for <b>glucitol</b> induction. When this sequence was inserted in a high-copy-number plasmid, an elfect characteristic of titration of a transcriptional activator was seen. Downstream from the promoter, there is an imperfect, AT-rich inverted repeat sequence. Deletion of this element {{did not lead to}} constitutive expression of gutB. However, the induced gutB expression level was enhanced three- to fourfold. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that Bacillus subtilis has a unique pathway for <b>glucitol</b> catabolism (2, 4, 11).

40|$|The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent {{phosphorylation}} of <b>glucitol</b> {{has been}} shown to require four distinct proteins in Salmonella typhimurium: two general energy-coupling proteins, enzyme I and HPr, and two glucitol-specific proteins, enzyme IIgut and enzyme IIIgut. The enzyme IIgut was solubilized from the membrane and purified about 100 -fold, free of the other protein constituents of the phosphotransferase system. Enzyme IIIgut was found in both the soluble and the membrane fractions. The soluble enzyme IIIgut was purified to near homogeneity by gel filtration, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography on butylagarose. It was sensitive to parital inactivation by trypsin and N-ethylmaleimide, but was stable at 80 degrees C. The protein had an approximate molecular weight of 15, 000. It was phosphorylated in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, enzyme I, and HPr, and this phosphoprotein was dephosphorylated in the presence of enzyme IIgut and <b>glucitol.</b> Antibodies were raised against enzyme IIIgut.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity was greatly reduced in cells expressing high levels of the cloned gutB gene but was nearly normal in cells expressing high levels of the gutA gene. A chromosomal mutation in the gutR gene, which gave rise to constitutive expression of the chromosomal gut operon, also gave rise to growth inhibition on gluconeogenic substrates as well as reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity. Phosphoenolpyruvate synthase activity in general varied in parallel with that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

40|$|Expression of the <b>glucitol</b> {{dehydrogenase}} gene (gutB) {{is suggested}} {{to be regulated}} both positively and negatively in Bacillus subtilis. A mutation in the gutR locus results in the constitutive expression of gutB. The exact nature of this mutation and the function of gutR are still unknown. Cloning and characterization of gutR indicated that this gene is located immediately upstream of gutB and is transcribed {{in the opposite direction}} relative to gutB. GutR is suggested to be a 95 -kDa protein with a putative helix-turn-helix motif and a nucleotide binding domain at the N-terminal region. At the C-terminal region, a short sequence of GutR shows homology with two proteins, Cyc 8 (glucose repression mediator protein) and GsiA (glucose starvation-inducible protein), known to be directly or indirectly involved in catabolite repression. Part of the C-terminal conserved sequence from these proteins shows all the features observed in the tetratricopeptide motif found in many eucaryotic proteins. To study the functional role of gutR, chromosomal gutR was insertionally inactivated. A total loss of <b>glucitol</b> inducibility was observed. Reintroduction of a functional gutR to the GutR-deficient strain through integration at the amyE locus restores the inducibility. Therefore, GutR serves as a regulatory factor to modulate <b>glucitol</b> induction. The nature of the gutR 1 mutation was also determined.

In strains depleted of phosphoenolpyruvate {{and unable to}} metabolize the internal hexitol phosphate, internal mannitol- 1 -phosphate stimulated uptake of extracellular [14 C]mannitol, whereas external mannitol stimulated release of [14 C]mannitol from the intracellular [14 C]mannitol- 1 -phosphate pool. The stoichiometry of mannitol uptake to mannitol release was 1 : 1. <b>Glucitol</b> did not promote release of [14 C]mannitol from the mannitol phosphate pool but stimulated release of [14 C]glucitol from internal <b>glucitol</b> phosphate pools when the <b>glucitol</b> enzyme II was induced to high levels. In E coli cells and membrane vesicles, both vectorial and nonvectorial transphosphorylation reactions of hexitols and hexoses were demonstrated. The nonvectorial reactions, but not the vectorial reactions, catalyzed by the mannitol and glucose enzymes II, were inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent which inactivates enzymes II. Similarly, glucose- 6 -sulfate, an inhibitor of the glucose enzyme II-catalyzed transphosphorylation reaction, specifically inhibited the nonvectorial reaction. This compound was {{shown to be a}} noncompetitive inhibitor of methyl alpha-glucoside phosphorylation employing phospho-HPr as the phosphate donor. It apparently exerts its inhibitory effect by exclusive binding to the sugar phosphate binding site on the enzyme II complex.

The products of the decomposition have been examined by chromatography, ionophoresis and carrier dilution analysis, and found to be mainly oxidation products. The fact that the actual rate of self-decomposition was ca. ten times that of the theoretical rate suggested the participation of a secondary effect in the decomposition. A similarity between the products of self-decomposition and the products of hydroxyl radical attack on D-glueose was noted. It was inferred that water in the glucose sample enhanced self-decomposition by absorbing some of the B-radiation and yielding hydroxyl radicals in situ. PART II. The products of the oxidation of D-glucitol with a deficiency of periodate were identified and measured. The results were explained on a stereochemical basis assuming the formation of a 5 -membered cyclic intermediate in the periodate reaction. Periodate oxidation of the glucitol-borate complex in solution at pH 10 was attempted and compared with a similar oxidation of <b>glucitol</b> in phosphate buffer. The increased yield of L-xylose in the borate buffered oxidation was explained by the complexing of borate with <b>glucitol.</b> Certain anomalous results in both borate and phosphate were noted and are discussed.

The main methods used, alone or in combination, for solving the structures have been chemical degradation procedures, mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In the studies of Hafnia alvei it was established that the O-deacetylated O-specific polysaccharide isolated from LPS from H. alvei strains 1200 and 1203 possess the same composition and sequence as the O-deacetylated H. alvei strain 1205, i. e. a glycerol teichoic acid-like polymer having a repeating unit composed of a pentasaccharide unit. Serological tests revealed immunochemical similarities between the LPS of the Hafnia alvei strains PCM 1200, 1203 and 1205.

When the S 46 A mutation in HPr was reverted to give S 46 wild-type HPr, expression of gluconate kinase and <b>glucitol</b> dehydrogenase regained full sensitivity to repression by PTS sugars. These results suggest that phosphorylation of HPr at Ser- 46 is directly or indirectly involved in catabolite repression. A strain deleted for the ptsGHI genes was transformed with plasmids expressing either the wild-type ptsH gene or various S 46 mutant ptsH genes (S 46 A or S 46 D). Expression of the gene encoding S 46 D HPr, having a structure {{similar to that of}} P-ser-HPr according to nuclear magnetic resonance data, caused significant reduction of gluconate kinase activity, whereas expression of the genes encoding wild-type or S 46 A HPr had no effect on this enzyme activity.

IIB Gat is composed of a central four-stranded parallel beta sheet flanked by alpha helices on both sides. NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with IIAGat allowed the identification of the binding interface and preliminary modeling {{of the structure of the}} IIB Gat - IIAGat heterodimer. IIAGat was also phosphorylated in-vitro, producing several large chemical shift changes, but no changes to the overall structure...|$|E
40|$|The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent {{carbohydrate}} {{transport system}} (PTS) couples uptake with phosphorylation {{of a variety}} of carbohydrates in prokaryotes. In this multienzyme complex, the enzyme II (EII), a carbohydrate-specific permease, is constituted of two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and a transmembrane channel IIC domain. Among the five families of EIIs identified in Escherichia coli, the galactitol-specific transporter (II(gat)) belongs to the <b>glucitol</b> family and is structurally the least well-characterized. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to solve the three-dimensional structure of the IIB subunit (GatB). GatB consists of a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices on both sides; the active site cysteine of GatB is located at the beginning of an unstructured loop between beta 1 and alpha 1 that folds into a P-loop-like structure. This structural arrangement shows similarities with other IIB subunits but also with mammalian low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (LMW PTPase) and arsenate reductase (ArsC). An NMR titration was performed to identify the GatA-interacting residuesPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The kps locus for polysialic acid capsule {{expression}} in Escherichia coli K 1 {{is composed of}} a central group of biosynthetic neu genes, designated region 2, flanked on either side by region 1 or region 3 kps genes with poorly defined functions. Chromosomal mutagenesis with MudJ and subsequent complementation analysis, maxicell and in vitro protein expression studies, and nucleotide sequencing identified the region 1 gene, kpsE, which encodes a 39 -kDa polypeptide. Polarity of the kpsE::lacZ mutation suggests an operonic structure for region 1. KpsE is homologous to putative polysaccharide-translocation components previously identified in Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis group B. An open reading frame upstream of kpsE encodes a 35 -kDa polypeptide with homology to GutQ, a putative ATP-binding protein of unknown function encoded by gutQ of the <b>glucitol</b> utilization operon. Whether expression of the gutQ homolog as the potential first gene of region 1 is required for polysialic acid synthesis or localization is presently unknown...|$|E
40|$|Starch may be {{determined}} by hydrolysis with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase followed by specific measurement of glucose using glucose oxidase. However biological samples to be analysed for starch often also contain glucose, maltose and higher oligosaccharides derived from the hydrolysis of starch. These sugars {{may be difficult to}} remove quantitatively by solvent extraction. We have found that reduction with sodium borohydride followed by evaporation with 2, 2 dimethoxypropane removed interference from glucose, maltose and the two reducing terminal residues from higher oligosaccharides. The specific glucose test was not sensitive to <b>glucitol</b> produced by reduction of free glucose. Maltitol was not hydrolysed significantly by the amyloglucosidase, removing interference from maltose and the two reducing terminal residues from higher polymers. The method has potential for monitoring the hydrolysis of starch especially in the mobilisation of starch reserves in plant tissues such as in the endosperm of germinating cereal grains. A reduction ratio based upon the method is proposed for use in characterising starch hydrolysates...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} epitope {{specificities}} {{associated with the}} group antigen (group B polysaccharide) of group B streptococci {{have been identified in}} a polyclonal antiserum induced in rabbits by a nonencapsulated variant strain of group B streptococci. This was achieved by using a series of oligosaccharide inhibitors, obtained by both synthetic and degradative procedures, to inhibit the binding of the group B polysaccharide to the polyclonal antiserum. While the dominant epitope expressed in the antiserum was alpha-L-Rhap(1 [...] 2) alpha-L-Rhap(1 [...] 2) alpha-L-Rhap, specificities associated with alpha-L-Rhap and alpha-L-Rhap(1 [...] 3) alpha-D-Galp(1 [...] 3) beta-D-Glcp-NAc(1 [...] 4) alp ha-L-Rhap were also identified. The dominant expression of the former epitope is consistent with its terminal location on the group antigen and also with highly branched multiantennary structure of this antigen. Antibodies specific for the alpha-L-trirhamnopyranoside epitope were purified by affinity chromatography, using the synthetic trisaccharide <b>glucitol</b> as the hapten. Oligosaccharide inhibition studies indicate that the specificity of these antibodies is identical to that of a murine monoclonal antibody induced by the same nonencapsulated strain of group B streptococci...|$|E

Fen-Daqu is a saccharifying agent and fermentation starter in this fermentation process and in Fen traditional vinegar. To investigate the changes of biochemical components in Fen-Daqu during the incubation, samples at seven incubation stages were analyzed by H- 1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and principal component analysis (PCA). This revealed clear separation of the samples obtained from different incubation stages in the principal component plots by combining PC 1 and PC 2, which cumulatively accounted for 93. 27 % of the variance. The major compounds that contributed to discrimination were acetate/alanine, arginine, ascorbate, betaine, choline, ethanol, fructose, galactose, glucose, <b>glucitol,</b> glycerate, lactate, maltose, mannitol, phenylalanine, proline, propylene glycol, threonine and tryptophan. These compounds were regarded as the representative metabolites or biomarkers characteristic for each incubation stage and were related with microbiological changes of importance for quality control in Fen-Daqu production...|$|E

Mutants with defects in ptsH, galK, or the tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway were isolated either by positive selection using 2 -deoxyglucose or 2 -deoxygalactose or by an enrichment procedure with streptozotocin. ptsH mutations abolish growth on lactose, cellobiose, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, fructose, mannitol, <b>glucitol,</b> and ribitol, while growth on galactose continues at a reduced rate. Growth on galactose is also reduced, but not abolished, in galK mutants. A mutation in galK {{in combination with}} a mutation in the tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway results in sensitivity to galactose and lactose, while a galK mutation in combination with a mutation in ptsH completely abolishes galactose metabolism. Transport assays, in vitro phosphorylation assays, and thin-layer chromatography of intermediates of galactose metabolism also indicate the functioning of a permease/Leloir pathway and a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) /tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway. The galactose-PTS is induced by growth on either galactose or lactose, but the induction kinetics for the two substrates are different...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{information}} on the pathway(s) of assimilation of glucose by the wheat stem rust fungus (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), axenically grown mycelia were incubated with the glucose analog 2 -deoxy-d-[U- 14 C]glucose (2 dG), and the kinetics of movement of label into intracellular metabolites was determined. During the first 5 minutes after adding substrate, free 2 dG was transported into the cell, followed by phosphorylation. Further incubation over 5 h resulted in the accumulation of large pools of phosphorylated derivatives of 2 dG and 2 -deoxygluconate, and the accumulation of free dideoxytrehalose, 2 -deoxyglucitol, 2 -deoxygluconate, and traces of 2 -deoxygalactose. A lag in the accumulation of 2 -deoxyglucitol, without the prior accumulation of 2 -deoxyglucitol phosphates, supports the view that <b>glucitol</b> is synthesized by direct reduction of free hexoses(s). The kinetics of labeling indicates that the major route of metabolism was oxidation of 2 dG phosphate(s) to 2 -deoxygluconate phosphate(s), from which free 2 -deoxygluconate was released as a major end product; {{this is the first}} demonstration of this pathway of metabolism of 2 dG in a fungus...|$|E
