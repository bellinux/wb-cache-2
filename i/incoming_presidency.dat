25|$|On January 10, 2017, Dion was {{replaced}} as Minister of Foreign Affairs by Chrystia Freeland in a cabinet shuffle, with the move being seen {{in part as}} a response to United States President-elect Donald Trump's <b>incoming</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{detailed}} scrutiny work on EU documents is {{conducted by the}} sub-committees, each dealing with a separate policy area. The main committee oversees {{the work of the}} sub-committees and approves their reports and scrutinises proposals that cross subject areas, such as the Treaty of Lisbon and the multiannual financial framework. In addition, the main committee takes evidence on the EU presidency from each <b>incoming</b> <b>Presidency</b> country, and on meetings of the Council of the European Union from the Minister for Europe.|$|E
2500|$|The Institute's {{shift to}} {{environmental}} skepticism {{began with the}} publication of a report on global warming by William Nierenberg. During the 1988 United States presidential election, George H. W. Bush had pledged to meet the [...] "greenhouse effect with the White House effect." [...] Nierenberg's report, which blamed global warming on solar activity, had a large impact on the <b>incoming</b> Bush <b>presidency,</b> strengthening those in it opposed to environmental regulation. In 1990 the Institute's founders (Jastrow, Nierenberg and Seitz) published a book on climate change. The appointment of David Allan Bromley as presidential science advisor, however, saw Bush sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, despite some opposition from within his administration.|$|R
40|$|On June 17, 2011, the Center for Transatlantic Relations – {{together}} with the Center for European Policy Analysis, the Polish Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw, and the Embassies of Hungary and Poland – hosted authors writing on the theme “A Strong Europe in a Globalized World,” and who offered in-depth, substantive reflections about how the United States and Europe can work together more closely in meeting global challenges. Drawing on the agendas of the outgoing and <b>incoming</b> EU <b>Presidencies</b> of the Council of the European Union – Hungary and Poland respectively – authors focused {{on the importance of}} a strong US-EU partnership in the face of mounting global challenges, from the current financial and economic crisis through the insecurities of energy markets and the promise of the Arab Spring. Authors explored in depth four key areas of shared interests: A Global Perspective (Transatlantic Partnership in a Globalized World); Achievements and Deliverables of Eastern Partnership; Euro-Atlantic Perspectives for the Balkans; and Common Challenges of Energy Security. Senior Hungarian and Polish government officials, subject matter experts, private sector actors, and think tank scholars participated...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{investigating}} the potentials in alliance formation among the industrially-technologically {{less developed countries}} of the world using the framework of the 45 -year-old Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). While it will discuss the successes and missed opportunities of the first decades, especially with regard to the New International Economic Order (NIEO) of the 1970 s, some reflections will be provided upon Ambassador Živojin Jazić’s thoughts on the movement (published in CIRR, January – June 2005, 59 - 66.). In a critical approach, the analysis will focus on the need and reason for existence of the NAM and its place and future role in the global international system of the 21 st century. A detailed overview will be offered about the deepening problems of Africa and the attitude of the African countries towards the alliance, in particular in today’s international system in which the more developed ‘North’ prescribes for the ‘South’ what to do and how to do it. Attention will be devoted to the last two summits of the NAM (South African and Malaysian) and the <b>incoming</b> Cuban <b>presidency</b> from 2006 onwards...|$|R
5000|$|After {{election}} day, {{media outlets}} reported on persons described by various sources as possible appointments to senior {{positions in the}} <b>incoming</b> Trump <b>presidency.</b> The number of people which have received media attention as potential cabinet appointees is higher than in most previous presidential elections, partly because the Trump '16 campaign staff (and associated PACs) was significantly smaller and less expensive, thus there are not as many people already expected to receive specific roles in the upcoming Trump administration. In particular, [...] "Trump had a smaller policy brain trust group than a new president normally carries" [...] because as an anti-establishment candidate who began his campaign by largely self-funding {{his way to the}} Republican party nomination, unlike most previous presidential winners [...] "Trump does not have the traditional cadre of Washington insiders and donors to build out his Cabinet." [...] An additional factor that tends to make the field of potential nominees especially broad, is that unlike most presidential transition teams who select politicians as their appointees, the Trump transition team [...] "has started with a mandate to hire from the private sector opposed to the governmental sector whenever possible." ...|$|R
40|$|Throughout 2001, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, {{punctuated by}} {{gestures}} {{of peace and}} acts of violence, continued in its cycle of promise and disappointment. It was a year {{of changes in the}} Israeli and American administrations, as well as a call for a change in the Palestinian administration. It was a year which saw American involvement wax and wane and wax again. Although to no avail, U. S. President Bill Clinton strove to facilitate a lasting peace in the closing days of his <b>presidency.</b> <b>Incoming</b> President George W. Bush, stepping back in the initial months of his presidency from such intense American involvement in the region, retracted Clinton’s final peace plan. Soon, however, Bush realized the need to send a special envoy, General Anthony Zinni to the region in an attempt to support the diplomatic work of C. I. A. Director George Tenet to implement the Mitchell recommendations for peace. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s peace efforts, he was defeated in the February Israeli elections. He lost to the hard-liner Ariel Sharon, whose march across the contested Temple Mount in Jerusalem in September of 2000, sparked the round of violence that continues until today. Th...|$|R
