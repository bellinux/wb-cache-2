40|$|The {{denaturation}} {{of protein}} induced by urea has been intensively studied. 1 - 5 More {{recent studies have}} suggested that urea <b>denaturates</b> proteins via both direct and indirect (water mediated) interaction with moieties of different polarity of the protein.

Despite many literature data on the studies of use as a <b>denaturating</b> agent, the detailed mechanism of urea-water interaction is still an unsolved problem.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} the thermal {{denaturation}} of DNA yield a strong indication that the transition is first order. This transition has been theoretically studied since the early sixties, mostly within an approach in which the microscopic configurations of a DNA molecule are given by an alternating sequence of non-interacting bound segments and <b>denaturated</b> loops. Studies of these models neglect the repulsive, self-avoiding, interaction between different loops and segments and have invariably yielded continuous denaturation transitions. In this study we exploit recent results on scaling properties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology {{in order to take}} into account the excluded-volume interaction between <b>denaturated</b> loops and the rest of the chain. We thus obtain a first-order phase transition in d= 2 dimensions and above, in agreement with experiments.

We find that the unzipping transition is also first order. Although the denaturation and unzipping transitions are thermodynamically first order, they do exhibit critical fluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size distribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the <b>denaturated</b> end segment diverges as the transition is approached.

The hydrophobic surfaces consist of grafted self-assembled monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and polystyrene (PS) layer on silicon substrates. Different protein concentrations ranging from 1. mg/ml to 0. 01. mg/ml are used. On the OTS surface and for low protein concentration, the adsorbed protein layer consists of a dense layer of thickness around 13. å indicating that proteins are <b>denaturated</b> when adsorbed on the hydrophobic interface - myoglobin being a globular protein with an average diameter of about 40 å.

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{experimental}} studies of the thermal denaturation of DNA yield sharp steps in the melting curve suggesting that the melting transition is rst order. This transition has been theoretically studied since the early sixties, mostly within an approach in which the microscopic congurations of a DNA molecule consist of an alternating sequence of non-interacting bound segments and <b>denaturated</b> loops. Studies of these models neglect the repulsive, self-avoiding, interaction between dierent loops and segments and have invariably yielded continuous denaturation transitions. In the present study we take into account in an approximate way the excluded-volume interaction between <b>denaturated</b> loops {{and the rest of}} the chain. This is done by exploiting recent results on scaling properties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology. We also ignore the heterogeneity of the polymer. We obtain a rst-order melting transition in d = 2 dimensions and above, consistent with the experimental results. We also consider within our approach the unzipping transition, which takes place when the two DNA strands are pulled apart by an external force acting on one end. We nd that the under equilibrium condition the unzipping transition is also rst order. Although the denaturation and unzipping transitions are thermodynamically rst order, they do exhibit critical fluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size distribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the <b>denaturated</b> end segment diverges as the transition is approached. We evaluate these critical properties within our approach. PACS. 87. 14. Gg DNA, RNA { 05. 70.
