40|$|The role {{of changes}} in gain and nonradiative {{recombination}} {{as a function of}} temperature in p-doped quantum dot samples that exhibit a minimum in the threshold current versus temperature characteristics are examined using a detailed analysis based on the multisection measurement method. An <b>injection</b> <b>level</b> is defined as the difference between the transparency energy and the transition energy of the dot states so that the results at different temperatures may be compared. The temperature dependence of the <b>injection</b> <b>level</b> necessary to achieve the required gain produces the initial decrease in nonradiative recombination current and threshold current between 250 - 280 K. At higher temperatures, the nonradiative recombination increases due to both an increase in the <b>injection</b> <b>level</b> required to achieve a fixed value of gain and because of an increase in the nonradiative recombination at fixed <b>injection</b> <b>level.</b> Using measurements of the population inversion function it is shown that the reduction in the <b>injection</b> <b>level</b> required to achieve a fixed value of gain between 250 - 280 K is caused by the thermalization of the carrier distribution over this temperature range.

Using the example of crystalline silicon, we show that the frequently observed reduction and underestimation of J 0, which is strongly pronounced at high <b>injection</b> <b>levels,</b> originate from neglecting the finite carrier diffusion coefficient. This work presents an analysis taking into account the finite carrier diffusion coefficient and thus enabling to evaluate charge carrier lifetime data at high <b>injection</b> <b>levels</b> leading to strongly increased consistency of the determined J 0.
