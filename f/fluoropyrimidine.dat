Due to the drawbacks of 5-FU therapy, such as having to be administered {{over long periods of time}} via intravenous infusion and the development of resistance in tumors, more convenient and efficacious <b>fluoropyrimidine</b> therapy has been desired. [...] The <b>fluoropyrimidine</b> component of this drug, trifluridine, was first synthesized in 1964 by Heidelberger et al. [...] By the late 1960s, Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of intravenous trifluridine alone initially proved to be disappointing.

[...] In response to its pharmacokinetic properties, adjustments in the dosing regimen demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits in patients with breast cancer and colon cancer; with this new regimen, doses would be given every three hours to total a daily amount of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 8 to 13 days, and as a result, eight out of 23 breast cancer patients were reported to have a therapeutic response while one in six patients with colon cancer showed a near complete response to therapy. [...] Success of trifluridine as an effective anti-cancer agent was short lived, however, due to rapid tumor recurrence upon regression of therapy.

The CRC cell lines treated with 5 -FU showed increased expression of LINE- 1 mRNA. This was associated with upregulation of the phospho-histone H 2 A. X in cells with low LINE- 1 methylation, but not in cells with high LINE- 1 methylation. The 5 -FU-mediated induction of phospho-histone H 2 A.

In this review, we discuss literature data, defining predictive and prognostic markers actually identified in the treatment of CRC. We analyzed predictive markers of <b>fluoropyrimidines</b> effectiveness, principally for 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) and also for oral <b>fluoropyrimidines,</b> as thymidylate Synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), micro-satellite instability.

RESULTS: Maintenance with bevacizumab with or without <b>fluoropyrimidine</b> after bevacizumab-based induction treatment for 4 to 6 months significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 57; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 43 - 0. 75; P =. 0004) and showed a trend toward prolonged OS (HR, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 78 - 1. 02; P =. 09) compared with observation alone. The effect on PFS increased with the intensity of the maintenance regimen (HR, 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 60 - 0. 85 for single-agent bevacizumab vs. HR, 0. 45; 95 %, CI 0. 39 - 0. 51 for combination therapy, both compared to observation alone).

Methods: We	used	<b>fluoropyrimidines,</b>	 5 -fluorouracil	(FUra) 	and	 5 ’-fluoro- 2 ’-deoxyuridine	(FdUrd) 	as	anticancer	drugs,	and	 measured	mRNA	levels	of	NOX 1 	and	NOX 2 	with	semi-quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	(PCR),	quantitative	PCR	(qPCR) 	 and	microarray	assays	in	order. 	 Results:	We	found	that	expression	of	none	of	enzyme	subunits	was	altered	in	response	to	FUra	or	FdUrd,	except	expression	of	 p 67 phox. 	Expression	of	p 67 phox	was	induced	by	drugs	approximately	 25 -fold	relative	to	basal	level. 	 Conclusion: p 67 phox	subunit	may	be	a	key	subunit	in	NOX-mediated	ROS	production	following	exposure	to	drugs...|$|R
