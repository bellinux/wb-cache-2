40|$|Under {{the impact}} of the global {{economic}} crisis, the contemporary budget systems have been subject to extensive reforms. There is a growing number of scholars advocating the establishment of fully independent fiscal institutions which would be in charge of administering a sustainable fiscal policy. The bodies available in hitherto practice are <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils,</b> parliament committees on budgetary control or fiscal 'watchdogs'. The institutionalization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should provide for improving the quality of the public debate on fiscal policy and make the governments more fiscally accountable. The existing <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> generally have an advisory role and they are expected to contribute to strengthening the role of national parliaments in scrutinizing the national budget. In fact, the establishment of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> ensues only after introducing the fiscal rules which serve as statutory limitations on the activities of the executive branch in the budget-related matters. The current economic crisis has substantially hindered the efficient application of these fiscal restrictions. Some states see the solution in establishing independent fiscal institutions which would control the compliance with these rules. As one {{of the participants in the}} budgetary process, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> are in a position to provide better information to the voters on the current state of affairs in public finances and (thus) increase the political costs of the government's fiscal unaccountability. In practice, there are several models for the organization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> which primarily focus on ex ante or ex post review and assessment concerning whether the relevant institutions have observed the fiscal rules and accomplished the fiscal goals. Considering that their role is to eliminate the asymmetry of information in relations between the legislative and executive breach of government, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should contribute to reinforcing the legitimacy of the budgetary process and strengthening the fiscal discipline. In the new European fiscal governance framework, these institutions become particularly important in the context of mending the consequences of the current economic crisis. In their hitherto activities, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> have encountered some difficulties: their competences have been challenged, their assessment and recommendations have been disregarded, and their financial resources (aimed at promoting their activities) have been significantly restricted. Relying on this analysis, we may conclude that the independence and responsibility of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> largely depends on the government's resolve to be fully accountable in administering a sustainable fiscal policy...|$|R

5000|$|When Đilas {{was removed}} and the electoral {{campaign}} began, minister Zorana Mihajlović and Siniša Mali {{claimed that the}} city of Belgrade has a debt of over 700 million euros. Đilas disputed that, saying that the city owns 400 million euros, which was later confirmed by the Ministry of finance, headed by Lazar Krstić. Serbian Progressive Party, a political opponent of Đilas, already had {{the majority in the}} government at that time. However, that didn't prevent Mali from raising the sum of the city’s debt in the next several years, which he allegedly found when he took over, constantly changing the number: 960 milion in December 2013, 1,15 billion in March 2015, over 1,15 billion in December 2015, 1,12 billion in December 2016 (out of which he alleged 443 were paid off during his tenure) and over 1,1 billion in March 2017, out of which 450 was paid off. In December 2016, during the 2017 city budget hearing, Balša Božović, head of the councilor group of the Democratic Party in the city's assembly (which administered the city prior to 2013), handed over to Mali a framed report of the Finance Ministry's Public Debt Administration which confirms that the city debt on the day when Mali took over was 385 million euros. Mali later handed over another framed report to Božović claiming a debt of 1,18 billion. Božović replied that his [...] "gift" [...] has an official stamp of the state institution, while the other thing, given to him by Mali, is just a piece of printed paper. Official data from the Public Debt Administration shows that the city’s debt is stagnating for years (in million euros: 414 in 2013, 414 in 2014, 406 in 2015). Official data and Mali's claims are incompatible, especially since he claims that during his tenure the city didn’t borrow a dime. In June 2017 Mali repeated that city [...] "repaid hundreds of millions of euros of Đilas' debts". However, later that month, <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Council</b> of the Republic of Serbia, an independent state body accountable to the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, published their report on the fiscal results of the largest cities in Serbia.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluates the}} effects of the audit {{committee}} and the <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> with their different characteristics on earnings quality in Brazil. The proxies of earnings quality used are: relevance of accounting information, timeliness, and conditional conservatism. The sample consists of Brazilian companies listed on the Brazilian Securities, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) with annual liquidity above 0. 001 within the period from 2010 to 2013. Data were collected from the database Comdinheiro and the Reference Forms of companies available on the website of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) or the BM&FBOVESPA. The samples used in the study totaled 718, 688, and 722 observations for the value relevance, timeliness, and conditional conservatism models, respectively. The results indicate that different arrangements of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> and the existence of the audit committee differently impact the accounting information properties. The presence of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> positively impacted the relevance of equity, while the presence of the audit committee, the relevance of earnings. Conditional conservatism is evidenced in the group of companies with a permanent <b>fiscal</b> <b>council,</b> demonstrating that it is significant as a governance mechanism, rather than the installation for temporary operation when asked by shareholders in an ordinary general meeting. The presence of both showed significant earnings for the market, but they were not timely, something which exposes restriction to the relevance found.

It provides a detailed analysis of the strict provisions of the new Constitution regarding public finances, the strengthened mandates of the <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Council</b> and the renewed audit instruments of the State Audit Office of Hungary. The transformation of the institutional system and the regulatory environment was necessary because the significant increase in debt indicated that the earlier, more permissive regulation failed to attain its target. Experience confirmed that without strict rules and reinforced institutions {{it is not possible to}} regain the credibility of fiscal policy and to ensure the economical and responsible financial management of the public sector.
