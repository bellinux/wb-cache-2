5000|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> is {{uncommon}} and its prevalence is not known. (In 1974 {{more than}} 200 cases {{were reported in}} published literature). [...] It affects men and women equally although some publications suggest the condition is slightly more prevalent in females. Case reports indicate that only white people are affected. [...] First onset of IH is most common {{between the ages of}} 20 and 50 years, and in females, onset can often coincide with puberty.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (IH), {{also known}} as {{periodic}} synoviosis, periodic benign synovitis, or periodic hydrarthritis, is a chronic condition of unknown cause characterized by recurring, temporary episodes of fluid accumulation in the knee. While the knee is mainly involved, occasionally other joints such as the elbow or ankle can additionally be affected. Fluid accumulation in the joint can be extensive causing discomfort and impairing movement, although affected joints are not usually very painful. While the condition is chronic, {{it does not appear}} to progress to more destructive damage of the joint. It seems to affect slightly more women than men.|$|E
40|$|Anakinra for a {{refractory}} case of <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> with a TRAPS-related {{gene mutation}} <b>Intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (IH) {{is a rare}} condition characterised by its periodic schedule: recurrent self-remitting episodes of acute arthritis with a fixed periodicity; this clinical picture has been recognised as a clue for diagnosis for a long time. 1 The pathogenesis of IH is unknown. An involvement of mastocytes has been reported. 2 Interestingly, Ca√±ete et al 3 found mutations of the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) in a small series of patients with IH. For management of the disease, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and colchicine are used, generally with good results, but some patients persist with recurrent episodes of arthritis. Here we report our experi-ence with the interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) inhibitor anakinra in...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen chronic knee effusions unresponsive to {{the usual}} methods of therapy were treated by {{intra-articular}} injections of radioactive gold (198 Au) and followed up for one year. Ten patients had classical rheumatoid arthritis; three <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (both knees were treated in one patient); two ankylosing spondylitis, and one synovitis of undetermined cause. In 12 knees the effusion completely disappeared, usually within three months. Temporary increased pain and swelling occurred {{during the first week}} in five cases. Radiation dosimetry is discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (IH) is a monoarticular {{disease of}} unknown etiology, {{characterized}} by episodic effusions, and it usually affects middle-aged women. Acute phase reactants are within normal range during attacks. Although this non-destructive disease has no definite treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intraarticular steroids, and radioactive and surgical synovectomy have been used. Here, we report a 37 -year-old female with IH in whom successful remission was obtained with colchicine treatment. This case {{is of interest}} since to our knowledge {{there have been only}} two patients reported in the literature with remission of IH achieved by colchicine...|$|E
40|$|Hench (1938) {{reported}} the ameliorating effect of pregnancy upon rheumatoid arthritis, fibrositis, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis,</b> and noted the comment of Garrod (1890) that pregnancy {{acted as a}} tem-porary check upon the development of chronic arthritis in some cases. Hench studied the effect of 37 pregnancies in 22 women and found striking relief in 20 of them. The relief of joint symptoms, as a rule, was felt {{in the early stages}} of pregnancy, and remission lasted until a few weeks after par-turition, when the arthritic symptoms recurred with equal or greater severity. The results achieved by some other scholars seem to point in the same direction. Barcelo Torrent and Alegre Marcet (1951) describe fifteen cases of rheumatoid arthritis, i...|$|E
40|$|Patients with a {{total of}} 112 chronic knee effusions unresponsive to the usual {{conservative}} methods of therapy were treated with intra-articular injections of radioactive gold and followed from 6 months to 5 years. Most patients in the study had rheumatoid arthritis but others had ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, intermittent hydrathrosis and undiagnosed synovitis. After 6 months 81 % showed improvement. This figure diminished to approximately 70 % at 1 and 2 years, 60 % at 3 and 4 years and 50 % at 5 years. The mose beneficial results were seen in patients with <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydrarthrosis.</b> Twelve patients with a synovial cyst and/or rupture improved. Patients with thin synovia and anatomic stage I or II disease did best, but those with stage III disease also did well. After the injection 33 % of the patients had a reactive synovitis. A variable amount of radioactive material escaped from the knee to the regional lymph nodes and general circulation...|$|E
