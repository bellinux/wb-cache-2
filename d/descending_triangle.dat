50|$|Triangle {{patterns}} can {{be broken}} down into three categories: the ascending triangle, the <b>descending</b> <b>triangle,</b> and the symmetrical triangle. While the shape of the triangle is significant, of more importance is the direction that the market moves when it breaks out of the triangle. Lastly, while triangles can sometimes be reversal patterns—meaning a reversal of the prior trend—they are normally seen as continuation patterns (meaning a continuation of the prior trend).|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} {{reactive sputtering}} method, namely the reactive gas pulsing process (RGPP) {{was developed for}} the synthesis of titanium oxynitride thin films. Such a method implements a metallic titanium target DC sputtered, a constant supply of argon and nitrogen gases and a pulsing oxygen mass flow rate, which is periodically controlled versus time. Various period times and different patterns can be generated: rectangle, sine, isosceles triangle, mounting or <b>descending</b> <b>triangle</b> and exponential. Real time measurements of the target potential as well as total sputtering pressure are recorded in order to study the instability phenomena of the process. They are also pertinent diagnostic tools to select the most suitable pulsing patterns required to alternate the process between the nitrided and the oxidized sputtering modes. As a result, alternation is produced for exponential and rectangular patterns. For this latter, {{the influence of the}} duty cycle α defined as the ratio of the injection time of oxygen by the pulsing period, on the behaviour of the reactive sputtering process and optical properties of deposited films, is systematically investigated. Finally, the added value brought by the exponential patterns is examined. It is shown that the exponential signal leads to significant improvements of the oxygen injection. The purpose is to introduce the right amount of oxygen so as to poison the titanium target surface without saturating the sputtering atmosphere by oxygen. Thus, the speed of pollution of the target surface appears as an appropriate parameter to better understand the beneficial effect of the exponential shape on the control of the RGPP method...|$|E

Producers always look for the ultimate: ever-accurate, foolproof, technical signals to tell what moves to make in the market. The problem is the markets are an ever-changing phenomenon; no one signal can predict prices with 100 percent accuracy. This NebGuide is design to give readers a feel for different kinds of tecnical signals analysts look for to determine market direction. Major signals discussed are: key reversals, double and triple bottoms, head and shoulders (top and bottom), and ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>triangles...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} novel {{criterion}} of pattern similarity in financial time series data. This criterion is robust, and concurs with human intuition. For fast pattern matching, we introduce a hierarchical piecewise linear representation of financial time series data. The {{piecewise linear approximation}} greatly reduces {{the complexity of the}} raw data, and the hierarchical representation keeps the structure of the time series data. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Patterns in the stock times series data In forecasting stock market, a popular method is to identify prototype patterns in the charts (plots of stock time series data), and forecast the future trend based on these chart patterns. Frequently used patterns include: symmetrical <b>triangles,</b> ascending <b>triangles,</b> <b>descending</b> <b>triangles,</b> Wedges, flags and pennants, rectangles, head and shoulders. Another related problem is to find patterns in the historical data that are similar to the current stock market pattern because many people believe that [...] ...|$|R
