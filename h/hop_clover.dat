50|$|Trifolium aureum, {{known by}} the various common names large hop trefoil, large trefoil, large <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> golden clover or <b>Hop</b> <b>clover,</b> is a species of clover native to much of Eurasia.|$|E
5000|$|Trifolium micranthum, {{the slender}} trefoil or slender <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> is a plant {{species of the}} genus Trifolium in the [...] "pea family" [...] Fabaceae or Papillionaceae.|$|E
50|$|Trifolium dubium, {{the lesser}} trefoil, {{suckling}} clover, little <b>hop</b> <b>clover</b> or lesser hop trefoil, is a flowering {{plant in the}} pea and clover family Fabaceae. This species is generally accepted as the primary plant to represent the traditional Irish shamrock.|$|E
50|$|Endothall or 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid {{is used as}} an {{herbicide}} {{for both}} terrestrial and aquatic plants. It {{is used as a}}n aquatic herbicide for submerged aquatic plants and algae in lakes, ponds and irrigation canals. It is used as a desiccant on potatoes, <b>hops,</b> cotton, <b>clover</b> and alfalfa. It is used as a biocide to control mollusks and algae in cooling towers.|$|R
5000|$|Von Thaer's [...] "Principles of Agriculture" [...] {{contain the}} result of his {{experience}} through a series of years. The work embraces the theory of the soil, the clearing of land, plowing, manuring, and irrigation, hedges and fences, management of meadow and pasture lands; the cultivation of wheat, rye, corn, oats, barley, buckwheat, <b>hops,</b> tobacco, <b>clover,</b> and all the varieties of grasses; the economy of kine stock, breeding and feeding; the management of the dairy, and the use of manures, and the various systems of cultivation, keeping journals and farm records. In brief, it is a complete cyclopedia or circle of practical agriculture.|$|R
60|$|It was {{somewhat}} wearisome, waiting and watching so long, {{and the warm}} sun and the soft chirp of the crickets that <b>hopped</b> through the <b>clover</b> made Twinkle drowsy. She didn't intend to go to sleep, because then she might miss the woodchuck; {{but there was no}} harm in closing her eyes just one little minute; so she allowed the long lashes to droop over her pretty pink cheeks--just because they felt so heavy, {{and there was no way}} to prop them up.|$|R
5000|$|Trifolium campestre, {{commonly}} known as hop trefoil, field clover and low <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> is a species of clover native to Europe and western Asia, growing in dry, sandy grassland habitats, fields, woodland margins, roadsides, wastelands and cultivated land. The species name campestre means [...] "of the fields".|$|E
50|$|Also spelled medic or meddick, {{the plant}} is known {{by a number of}} {{alternate}} names, including nonesuch, black nonesuch, black medic clover, <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> hop medic, black clover, black hay, blackweed, English trefoil, hop trefoil, and yellow trefoil. Some of these names are also applied to wildflowers of the related genera Trifolium and Melilotus.|$|E
50|$|Medicago lupulina, {{commonly}} known as black medick, nonesuch, or <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> is a familiar lawn plant belonging to the legume or clover family. Plants of the genus Medicago, or bur clovers, {{are closely related to}} the true clovers (Trifolium) and sweet clover (Melilotus). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of the lesser trefoil. Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.|$|E
50|$|Kiger {{island has}} long been used for raising cattle, however it has {{predominantly}} been used for agronomy purposes. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, (James) Grant Elgin kept a large peach orchard on the island. Oregon's 14th Governor Oswald West (a state land agent at the time) owned the Island Home hopyard on the island from 1905 to 1909. A large variety of crops have subsequently been grown including apples, peaches, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, filberts, walnuts, wheat, corn, grass seed, <b>clover,</b> <b>hops,</b> tulip bulbs, and peppermint (first planted 1995-96).|$|R
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is restharrow, hare's-foot <b>clover,</b> <b>hop</b> trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, musk mallow, clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, brown knapweed, greater knapweed, small scabious, woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Symanzik {{improvement of the}} Wilson quark action on anisotropic lattices. Taking first a general action with nearest-neighbor and clover interactions, we study the mass dependence of {{the ratio of the}} <b>hopping</b> parameters, the <b>clover</b> coefficients, and an improvement coefficient for heavy-light vector and axial vector currents. We show how tree-level improvement can be achieved. For a particular choice of the spatial Wilson coupling, the results simplify, and O(m_ 0 a_τ) improvement is possible. (Here m_ 0 is the bare quark mass and a_τ the temporal lattice spacing.) With this choice we calculate the renormalization factors of heavy-light bilinear operators at one-loop order of perturbation theory employing the standard plaquette gauge action.

40|$|Outcome: •	Reduction of soil erosion, given a good development. •	Suppression of seed-propagated weeds. •	Better {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the}} soil during harvest. •	Fixation of nitrogen thanks to the legumes, and utilisation of nutrients in the soil after maize harvest. •	Grazing possible immediately after maize harvest. Inconveniences: •	Competition for water {{in the case of}} severe drought. •	Cost of seeds. How to proceed: •	Sow the maize at the beginning of May. •	If possible, harrow a first time before appearance of the maize plants (blind harrowing). Second harrowing should take place at a plant height of 10 cm, when the maize plants are well rooted. Between a plant size of 10 to 20 cm a first hoeing should take place. •	Apply liquid manure at 25 - 30 m 3 per ha. •	When the maize plants reach a height of about 20 to 30 cm (from 4 - to 6 -leaf stage), undertake a second hoeing. Combine the second hoeing with simultaneous sowing of the catch crop into the weed-free crop. •	Recommended pure crops/crop mixtures: - Pure-clover crop: small-leaved white clover, <b>hop</b> <b>clover,</b> red clover (200 g/a) or sub clover (300 g/a). White clover and <b>hop</b> <b>clover</b> are less competitive than red clover or sub clover. Attention: Egyptian, Italian and Persian clover are normally too competitive. - Clover-mixtures are less risky: E. g. sub clover/red clover (at a mixing ratio of 5 : 2, a total of 300 g/a) or white clover/hop clover 1 : 1, a total of 200 g/a. - For farms with livestock, mixtures of grass and clover are an option. They can be used for grazing in autumn: E. g. white clover/smooth meadow-grass or meadow fescue or ryegrass (at a mixing ratio of 1 : 1, a total of about 250 g/a). Attention: ryegrass can be too competitive depending on the weather conditions. Tips: •	If possible, sow before a longer precipitation period. •	Sowing of catch crops is only successful until the maize reaches a height of around 30 cm. Late sowings are strongly suppressed by shading of the crop and cannot properly develop. •	During long drought periods, competition for water and nutrients can impair the development of the catch crop or, if the catch crop grows too lush, the development of the maize. •	In the case of the presence of root spreading weeds like docks and couch grass, a catch crop is not recommended, as this would require tillage after the maize harvest. •	The catch crop is only profitable if it remains for the duration of winter. Depending on its development and use, it could also be utilised in the following summer. If it is incorporated into the soil in spring, it has a high value as a green manure crop...|$|E
