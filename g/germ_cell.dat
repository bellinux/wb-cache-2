40|$|In Drosophila, {{the sex of}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is {{determined}} by cell-autonomous and inductive signals. XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> autonomously enter spermatogenesis when developing in a female host. In contrast, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> non-autonomously become spermatogenic when developing in a male host. In first instar larvae with two X chromosomes, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> enter the female or the male pathway depending on {{the presence or absence}} of transformer (tra) activity in the surrounding soma. In somatic cells, the product of tra regulates the expression of the gene double sex (dsx) which can form a male-specific or a female-specific product. In dsx mutant larvae, XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> develop abnormally, with a seemingly intersexual phenotype. This indicates that female-specific somatic dsx products feminize XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> and male-specific somatic dsx products masculinize XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that tra and dsx control early inductive signals that determine the sex of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and that somatic signals also affect the development of XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that develop in pseudomales lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl are spermatogenic. If, however, female-specific tra functions are expressed in these animals, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become oogenic. Furthermore, transplanted XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> can become oogenic and form eggs in XY animals that express the female-specific function of tra. Therefore, TRA product present in somatic cells of XY animals or in animals lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl, is sufficient to support developing XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> through oogenesis...|$|R
