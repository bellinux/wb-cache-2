5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channels,</b> {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{conspiracy}} {{issue was}} ultimately addressed by William G. E. Wiseman, head of British {{intelligence in the}} United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channels.</b> This led {{to the arrest of}} Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its embassy to co-operate with the investigations resolving the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war.|$|E

5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channels</b> that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H. Seward {{that there would be}} no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would {{continue}} to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber-rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channels</b> that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.|$|E
5|$|Zappas was notably {{inspired}} by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition {{through his own}} efforts and resources. In early 1856, he sent a letter through <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channels</b> to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund {{the revival of the}} Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors. However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were a throwback to ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event. For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events. King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four-year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.|$|E

His army included a few Europeans like Jean-François Allard, however he did not employ the British which were attempting to create a British colony in South Asia. However, he kept an open dialogue and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channel</b> with the British; in 1828, Ranjit Singh sent gifts to the King of Great Britain and in 1831, he sent a mission to Simla to confer with the British Governor General, Lord William Bentinck; while in 1838, he cooperated with them in removing the hostile Islamic Sultan in Afghanistan.|$|R

5|$|More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, {{have tried}} to see Warwick {{in light of the}} {{standards}} of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channel</b> – were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king {{at the time of his}} first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.|$|R

50|$|Events {{took place}} in 1926 that would set the course for a {{dramatic}} shift {{in the role of}} the federal viceroy and ultimately result in the creation of a distinct monarchy for Canada. Until that point, the governor general remained a representative in Canada of the British government, but was still able to exercise the Royal Prerogative over the Canadian prime minister without orders from the King in his British Council back in Westminster. When the governor general at the time, the Lord Byng of Vimy, did just that and forced Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to resign in what came to be known as the King-Byng Affair, the latter was, once reappointed following that year's general election, motivated to raise at the 1926 Imperial Conference questions about the relationship between the Dominions and the United Kingdom. The first ministers were mostly receptive, and, following the close of the meeting, the Balfour Declaration was issued, wherein it was declared that the Dominions of the British Crown were to be considered equal to the United Kingdom, as Mackenzie King had wished, and the Governor General of Canada, as with all the other governors-general of the empire, would be the direct representative of the King in person, rather than a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>channel</b> between the Canadian and British governments.|$|R

40|$|The unfortunate {{experience}} {{in recent years}} of the American holders of defaulted foreign bonds led to the passage by Congress on May 27, 1933, of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders Act, as Title II of the Federal Securities Act.

5000|$|The CBI {{now with}} the help of the UK Government is {{exploring}} the option of getting Shankaran de-ported as his passport has been cancelled by the Indian Government.

Nadeem resisted attempts by the Mumbai Police to extradite him in 2001. He cannot return to India because of an arrest warrant against him. A similar fate awaits Shankaran. Now, in a dramatic twist, the CBI's quarry has turned on his pursuers. In a two-page statement sent to India today on 16 April, Shankaran charged CBI with producing false evidence to try and extradite him. [...] "During the extradition trial, the appellant provided the UK court evidence under Freedom of Information Act which showed that many of the CBI submissions in the UK court or in the extradition request were simply false."Shankaran claims he has received a UK High Court directive to CPS to reimburse the 125,000 pound (Rs. 12 million) legal expenses he incurred in fighting the extradition case.
