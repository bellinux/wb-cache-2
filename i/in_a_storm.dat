5|$|On {{hearing that}} her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> at sea, Agrippina plots {{to secure the}} throne for Nero, her son by a {{previous}} marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes ("Con saggio tuo consiglio"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to {{the porch of the}} Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak. It blew down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> in the early 1990s. A piece of the tree was saved as a memorial and is on display at nearby Pioneer Elementary School in Hanford.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1982season (with Debby), the Hurricane Hunter Aircraft (also {{known as}} P-3s) began running a new mission for NOAA's Hurricane Research Division. The {{mission was to}} drop dropwindsondes that {{deployed}} very-low Omega frequency signals. These signals were to estimate the sonde's motion compared to the aircraft in certain areas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E

5|$|Admiral de Grasse {{returned}} with his fleet to the West Indies. In a major engagement that ended Franco-Spanish {{plans for the}} capture of Jamaica in 1782, he was defeated and taken prisoner by Rodney in the Battle of the Saintes. His flagship Ville de Paris was lost at sea <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> while being conducted back to England {{as part of a}} fleet commanded by Admiral Graves. Graves, despite the controversy over his conduct in this battle, continued to serve, rising to full admiral and receiving an Irish peerage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the French Revolutionary War, Gibraltar served in the Channel Fleet, {{fighting}} at the Glorious First of June in 1794 before being sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795. In June, the ship was in an action off Hyères; then, in December 1796, she was badly damaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> and had to return to England for major repairs. By June Gibraltar was back in the Mediterranean, serving in the navy's Egyptian campaign, where she remained during and beyond the Peace of Amiens, except for a short period when she was sent home for a refit.|$|E
5|$|Both {{monitors}} were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 and Rusalka sank <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> on 7 September 1893 {{during a}} voyage between Reval (Tallinn) and Helsingfors (Helsinki) {{with the loss}} of her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men. Despite an extensive search, the only traces of her found were one body and some debris that washed ashore. Charodeika remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911–12.|$|E

5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill. Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> drain.|$|E
5|$|Doria passed near {{or through}} the {{northern}} Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.|$|E

5|$|Nairana was {{returned}} to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, {{and spent the next}} 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between Tasmania and Melbourne. She was twice struck by rogue waves in Bass Strait, and nearly capsized on both occasions. Nairana was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the Second World War, and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was laid up in 1948, wrecked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> three years later and scrapped in situ in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|Sercey, {{under orders}} not to risk his squadron, and fearing {{that he was}} facing a {{superior}} force, retreated, declining to risk a battle. Sercey did momentarily reconsider when the British ships equally declined to attack the temporarily disabled frigate Forte, but eventually withdrew completely. He retired to his base at Île de France (now Mauritius) where he learned of his error. The East Indiamen reached reached Whampoa Anchorage having lost only one ship, which wrecked in the Flores Sea <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> {{the day after the}} encounter.|$|E

5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} blown off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough {{had to be}} played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, {{in the region of}} £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|E
5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.|$|E
