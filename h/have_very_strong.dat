25|$|People {{not only}} use these three {{slightly}} differing spelling systems, {{but they also}} write words more or less as they pronounce them. Because of this words are often spelt in various ways, for example sena/sina 'that, there', kothai/kothay/kothei/kothey/kothe 'back of head, occiput'. Variation like this depends on age, family, island, and other factors such as poetic speech. It can be difficult at times to decide which is most correct — different people have different opinions (and sometimes <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> opinions).|$|E
25|$|An {{instantaneous}} evaluation about {{intentions of}} an approaching person or subject based upon visual clues might <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> connection with initial stages of biological evolution. The reason why it happens so quickly inside our brains {{has to do with}} both risks and benefits subjected with any person or subject that is being encountered at very first time. The latency time of an entire evaluation process suggests a crucial adaption done by pre-historic creatures based upon their earlier experiences of encounters with strangers. Lesser time the process of identification takes, better are the chances of survival.|$|E

25|$|By {{its great}} generality, {{abstract}} algebra {{can often be}} applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, {{and can be used}} to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.|$|E
25|$|Each {{ethnic group}} has {{distinct}} performing arts, with little overlap between them. Malay art shows some North Indian influence. A form of art called mak yong, incorporating dance and drama, remains {{strong in the}} Kelantan state. However, older Malayan-Thai performing arts such as mak yong have declined in popularity throughout the country due to their Hindu-Buddhist origin. Since the Islamisation period, the arts and tourism ministry have focused on newer dances of Portuguese, Middle Eastern, or Mughal origin. Malay traditional dances include joget melayu and zapin. In recent years, dikir barat has grown in popularity, and it is actively promoted by state governments as a cultural icon. Silat is another popular Malay martial art and dance form, believed to increase a person's spiritual strength. Wayang kulit (shadow puppet theatre) has been popular in Malaysia for centuries. The puppets are usually made with cow and buffalo skin, and are carved and painted by hand. Plays done with shadow puppets are often based on traditional stories, especially tales from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Traditionally, theatrical music is performed only by men. Javanese immigrants brought Kuda Kepang to Johor, and {{is a form of}} dance where dancers sit on mock horses and tells the tales of Islamic wars. The Chinese communities brought traditional lion dances and dragon dances with them, while Indians brought art forms such as Bharata Natyam and Bhangra. Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese Farapeira and Branyo. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances.|$|E
500|$|The head is {{long with}} an overall shape similar to an {{equilateral}} triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head {{is considered to be}} a defect. The eyes are almond shaped and oblique, and may be of any colour. The ears are large, wide at the base, and high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of the lynx. All coat colors are accepted except chocolate and lilac and the dilutions fawn and cinnamon.

500|$|In Sonic Boom, {{although}} the two <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> and obvious feelings for each other, they attempt to conceal them at every possibility. Sonic has a framed portrait of Amy in his home, while Amy carries a picture of Sonic in her purse. Whenever {{one of the two}} shows even the slightest attraction towards anyone else, the other becomes immensely jealous. These hidden feelings are often played with and made to be points of humor and entertainment in the series. In the episode [...] "Tails' Crush", Sonic reveals to Tails that his strategy to attract potential romantic interests is to simply act aloof and disinterested, while Amy tells Tails that she's partial to knightly and chivalrous behavior (and thus is likely waiting for Sonic to make the first move). Hence, the two have yet to make their feelings evident.|$|E
500|$|Devine {{described}} {{the challenge of}} developing Halo Wars as [...] "getting Halo fans to play a realtime strategy game, and getting realtime strategy fans to play a Halo game." [...] "Fans of the [...] series <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> expectations for how a Halo games looks, feels and plays. Halo is all about heroic action to save humanity, mega-battles across the galaxy, visceral, highly-tuned combat and heart-pounding tension," [...] Pace said. These themes were considered fundamental to the Halo experience, and so Ensemble tried to replicate them for Halo Wars. Early in play tests, the developers watched devoted Halo fans play the game; their feedback {{led to the development}} of special abilities, which, according to Devine, enhanced the Halo feel. Ensemble initially considered making the Flood a playable race, but this idea did not progress beyond the concept stage. According to Devine, this was largely because the Flood would have needed to be similar to StarCrafts Zerg, in order to maintain balance with the UNSC and Covenant. This did not match the Flood's role as [...] "the single scariest thing in the galaxy".|$|E
500|$|HeartGold and SoulSilver were {{released}} in 2009, {{ten years after}} Gold and Silvers release for the Game Boy Color. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented {{on the development of}} the remakes: [...] "The first thing that I knew I needed to bear in mind was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played Gold and Silver ten years before. I think that players <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> memories of the game, so they'd think things like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If I do this here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings." [...] However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing Pokémon in recent years on the Game Boy Advance or the Nintendo DS. An in-game author surrogate of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without [...] "redoing the same thing". He also states that making the game was a [...] "rewarding challenge". HeartGold and SoulSilver introduced many new features that were absent in the original Gold and Silver. Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS Pokémon games, such as Diamond (2006), Pearl (2006), and Platinum (2008).|$|E

2500|$|This Spartan Life has a {{full cast}} of {{characters}}, each with their own unique qualities, which serve to move the show along. As is typical in machinima, the characters <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> personalities and are heavily characterized {{in order to make}} up for the weakness of machinima: the inability to act. The host, Damian Lacedaemion, is a personable soldier in grey with a smiley face emblem adorning his armor. He leads the show with his carefree manner, and when his guests come under fire, he often has to fall back on his soldiering skills to save them. He tries to rise to a [...] "higher level of discourse" [...] and is the center of the civil nature of the show. Damian has a shotgun, named Phil, which can talk, and prefers to be used exclusively by Damian and will fight anyone attempting to use him without authorization. The show's DJ, DJ Octobit, is named in a reference to the 8-bit music he plays in the show. He creates the music for the show on his DJ console, which looks like a strange round pedestal. He never speaks, yet he has defended Damian on several occasions. [...] In the first episode he is referred to as Doctor Octobit, but later his name was changed to DJ Octobit. The show featured a co-host under the tag of d4rk5had0w other-wise known as K. He played a small role in the mini-series as a stand-up comedy Spartan but later left the show. The show also features the Solid Gold Elite Dancers (a reference to the 1980s television series Solid Gold). They usually dance to music by Glomag, the alias of Chris Burke, and a segment in the show is reserved for them.|$|E
