The article {{compares the}} {{structure}} of business correspondence between German and Ukrainian languages. Business correspondence is instrumental in establishing official, business and partner contacts between government institutions and private companies alike. It is also {{a major factor in}} building relationships between individuals. Business correspondence in Germany is defined by <b>German</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standards</b> (DIN 5008, 676) and has more requisite elements than it does in Ukraine. The differences lie in the format and placement of the date, the main text of German letter being divided into three parts versus two parts in Ukrainian, the signature in German letter is placed above the name of the author while Ukrainian letter has it across from author's name. Ukrainian business letter does not call for specify its subject before the salutation. Common to both German and Ukrainian business letters is the use of a certain minimum of set expressions and stock phrases predicated upon a limited number of standard aspects of business writing which tend to be highly repetitive (letter of notification, request, proposal, demand, refusal, agreement). Covered herein are main types of German business letters (corporate partnership request letter, inquiry letter, business proposal letter, marketing letter, repeat offer letter, order letter, refusal letter, complaint letter, reminder letter), their characteristic features and typical stock phrases and set expressions. A grammatical analysis shows that business correspondence is marked by prevalence of present tense, more frequent use of active voice over passive, rather frequent occurrence of infinitive constructs with "zu" and imperative mood, rather infrequent occurrence of subordinate clauses ? mainly noun, adjective and conditional clauses. Recent times are marked by a substantial reduction in use of subjunctive mood Konjunktiv II. ? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ??????? ?????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{topic of}} this {{research}} thesis is {{the determination of the}} fatigue characteristics of NBG 18 graphite, which is the preferred material for the graphite structures of a high temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor (HTR). This is a newly developed fine grained (maximum grain size of 1, 6 mm) near-isotropic graphite grade, that was developed by SGL Carbon for Pebble Bed Modular Reactor company (PBMR), for the application mentioned. SGL Carbon is an overseas company who develops and manufactures graphite materials for nuclear and other applications. PBMR is a South African company who is pioneering the German invented, pebble bed type, high temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor for power generation purposes. A new test specimen geometry, complete with associated test machine grips, is designed for the determination of the uniaxial fatigue properties of this material across a wide spectrum of load ratios. The geometry of this specimen, called the S 70 specimen, is based on the cylindrical ASTM E 466 specimen. Tests are conducted for load ratios that range from the static tensile tests, R = + 1 /+ 1 to the static compression tests, R = - 1 /- 1. The fatigue cycle ratios are R =+ 0. 5, 0, - 0. 5, - 1, - 2, -oo and + 2. The stress-life curve (S-N diagram) is determined by testing eight specimens per load with four loads for each load ratio. The Maximum Principal stress is the stress basis for these load ratios. Constant-life charts are compiled for NBG 18 from the logarithmic regression equations of the S-N curves. The results of the static strengths compare well with the values quoted by the supplier for NBG 18. The uniaxial fatigue characteristics of NBG 18 are superior to those of V 483 T 2 for all load ratios. The fatigue characteristics of V 483 T 2 were determined before by Schmidt (2001 a). The latter material, which is also a product of SGL Carbon, was the <b>German</b> <b>industry</b> <b>standard</b> material for this application. A novel multiaxial fatigue test specimen, called the S 60 B specimen, complete with hydrostatic test equipment, is designed for the determination of the multiaxial fatigue characteristics of NBG 18 for the same spectrum of load ratios as for the uniaxial fatigue tests. The geometry of the specimen approaches that of a hemisphere. The main features of the new test specimen are its low cost, low cost of associated test equipment and its relative insensitivity to orientation with regard to the grain direction of the graphite. The Maximum Principal stress is the stress basis for the load ratios, similar to the uniaxial tests. Constant-life charts are compiled for NBG 18 using the regression equations of the S-N diagrams. The static tensile strength compares reasonably well with the results of the manufacturer. The static compressive strength subject to this multiaxial loading mode is much higher than expected. This may be attributed to internal friction that is created by the tangential principal stresses. The modified Maximum Deformation Strain Energy stress (MDE) that is prescribed as the stress basis in the KTA 3232 design code, does not yield satisfactory predictions of the multiaxial static failure of the S 60 B specimen, manufactured from NBG 18 graphite. Possible damage due to low pressure (10 MPa), isostatic loading of the graphite, is too small to be conclusive. The measured reduction in strength is less than 3 % for all static strengths and a fatigue life of 100 cycles. This research establishes the capability to perform uniaxial and multiaxial fatigue tests in South Africa. The technology is established at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth and the North-West University in Potchefstroom respectively. Doctora...|$|R
