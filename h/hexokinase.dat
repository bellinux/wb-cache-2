5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. <b>Hexokinase</b> is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes <b>hexokinase</b> to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and <b>hexokinase,</b> both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E
5|$|These {{sections}} are subdivided {{by other}} {{features such as}} the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, <b>hexokinase</b> (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).|$|E
40|$|<b>Hexokinases</b> {{have emerged}} as novel {{mediators}} of the antiapoptotic effects of growth factors {{in a wide variety}} of cells. These effects have been attributed to highly regulated direct physical and functional interactions with mitochondria. The demonstration that mitochondrial <b>hexokinases</b> can prevent apoptogenic ‘Bax attack’ in proximal tubule cells suggests a need to reexamine the specific contributions of <b>hexokinases</b> and glucose metabolism in this nephron segment and elsewhere within the kidney...|$|R
2500|$|The {{intracellular}} reactions {{mediated by}} <b>hexokinases</b> can be typified as: ...|$|R
25|$|This {{is about}} {{half the size of}} the other {{mammalian}} <b>hexokinases,</b> which retain a degree of dimeric structure. Several sequences and the three-dimensional structure of the key active sites. The ATP binding domain, for example, are shared with <b>hexokinases,</b> bacterial glucokinases, and other proteins, and the common structure is termed an actin fold.|$|R
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, <b>hexokinase,</b> the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, <b>hexokinase</b> is {{directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E
25|$|A hydropathy {{analysis}} of <b>hexokinase</b> in yeast {{has been created}} by these standards. It appears as if <b>hexokinase</b> possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400. Therefore, <b>hexokinase</b> is most likely not an integral membrane protein in yeast.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} kinetic properties distinguish glucokinase {{from the}} other <b>hexokinases,</b> allowing it to function in a special role as glucose sensor.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the other}} <b>hexokinases,</b> HKDC1 was {{dramatically}} overexpressed in cancer tissues, indicating that this isoform might play an important and different role in cancer growth. Further experiments clarifying this role will be required for developing HKDC1 as a therapeutic target.|$|R
25|$|Glucokinase {{has a lower}} {{affinity}} for glucose than the other <b>hexokinases.</b> Glucokinase changes conformation and/or function in parallel with rising glucose concentrations in the physiologically important range of 4–10 mmol/L (72–180 mg/dl). It is half-saturated at a glucose concentration of about 8mmol/L (144mg/dl).|$|R
25|$|<b>Hexokinase</b> II/B {{constitutes}} the principal regulated isoform in many cell types and is increased in many cancers. It is the <b>hexokinase</b> found in muscle and heart. <b>Hexokinase</b> II is also {{located at the}} mitochondria outer membrane so it can have direct access to ATP.|$|E
25|$|Hexokinases I and II can {{associate}} physically to {{the outer}} surface of the external membrane of mitochondria through specific binding to a porin, or voltage dependent anion channel. This association confers <b>hexokinase</b> direct access to ATP generated by mitochondria, {{which is one of}} the two substrates of <b>hexokinase.</b> Mitochondrial <b>hexokinase</b> is highly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumor cells, with levels up to 200 times higher than normal tissues. Mitochondrially bound <b>hexokinase</b> has been demonstrated to be the driving force for the extremely high glycolytic rates that take place aerobically in tumor cells (the so-called Warburg effect described by Otto Heinrich Warburg in 1930).|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} protein {{involved}} in carbohydrate metabolism that {{is worthy of}} mention along with GLUT-4. The enzyme <b>hexokinase</b> phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, most notably glucose, {{which is the first}} step in glycolysis. When glucose is transported into the cell it is phosphorylated by <b>hexokinase.</b> This phosphorylation keeps glucose from leaving the cell, and by changing the structure of glucose through phosphorylation, it decreases the concentration of glucose molecules, maintaining a gradient for more glucose to be transported into the cell. <b>Hexokinase</b> II transcription is increased in both red and white skeletal muscle upon treatment with AICAR. With chronic injections of AICAR, total protein content of <b>hexokinase</b> II increases in rat skeletal muscle.|$|E
2500|$|ATP {{participates in}} the {{reaction}} in a form complexed to magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor. Furthermore, under certain conditions, glucokinase, like other <b>hexokinases,</b> can induce phosphorylation of other hexoses (6 carbon sugars) and similar molecules. Therefore, the general glucokinase reaction is more accurately described as: ...|$|R
5000|$|Glucokinase {{has a lower}} {{affinity}} for glucose than the other <b>hexokinases.</b> Glucokinase changes conformation and/or function in parallel with rising glucose concentrations in the physiologically important range of 4-10 mmol/L (72-180 mg/dl).

50|$|The {{location}} of the phosphorylation on a subcellular level occurs when glucokinase translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus of liver cells.

25|$|A <b>hexokinase</b> is {{an enzyme}} that phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most organisms, glucose {{is the most}} {{important}} substrate of hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate {{is the most important}} product. <b>Hexokinase</b> possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic phosphate group from ATP to a substrate.|$|E
25|$|The four {{regulatory}} enzymes are <b>hexokinase,</b> glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian <b>hexokinase</b> IV, also {{referred}} to as glucokinase, differs from other hexokinases in kinetics and functions.|$|E
30|$|The {{transport}} of glucose through the cell membrane via glucose transporter proteins and its subsequent intracellular phosphorylation by <b>hexokinases</b> are key steps required for its cellular accumulation [28]. The expression levels of glucose transporters and <b>hexokinases</b> are changed in many cancers [29, 30]. Chung et al. [31] suggested that increased numbers of glucose transporters at the plasma membrane of cancer cells {{may be a}} cause of increased [18 [*]F]FDG uptake, at least in colon cancers. Yun et al. [32] reported that GLUT 1 expression levels were consistently upregulated and that glucose uptake was enhanced in K-ras and B-raf mutated cells compared to wild type cells. Drug-induced changes in [18 [*]F]FDG uptake together with the expression levels of GLUTs and <b>hexokinases</b> in tumor cells may therefore serve as good predictors for how well [18 [*]F]FDG-PET {{can be used for}} monitoring response in vivo in xenografts from a particular cell line. We observed that GLUT 1 expression levels decreased in the plasma membrane and increased in the cytosol fractions of HCT 116 cells treated with RO 5126766. These results are indicative of a RO 5126766 -induced translocation of GLUT 1 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, which could be a possible mechanism behind the observed reductions in [18 [*]F]FDG uptake in the drug-treated cells. Similar translocation effects on glucose transporters have been reported for the EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib [9] and erlotinib [22].|$|R

40|$|Glucokinase {{is one of}} {{the four}} <b>hexokinases</b> present in {{mammalian}} tissues. It is expressed in two cell types that have to respond to changes in the blood glucose concentration, the liver parenchymal cell and the beta-cells of pancreatic islets.

One major characteristic of glucokinase is that it has a relatively low affinity for glucose and displays positive cooperativity for this substrate, despite the fact that it is a monomeric enzyme. Furthermore, unlike other <b>hexokinases,</b> it is not inhibited by micromolar (physiological) concentrations of glucose 6 -phosphate but by a regulatory protein that transduces the effect of fructose 6 -phosphate and of fructose 1 -phosphate.

40|$|AbstractGlycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3) is a serine/threonine {{protein kinase}} that is {{involved}} in the multiple signaling processes of a cell. Increasing evidence suggests that GSK 3 β {{plays a key role in}} multiple cellular processes in the progression of diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), inflammatory diseases, schizophrenia, bipolar and several mood disorders, and mitochondrial diseases. Recent research has found that increased GSK 3 β activity is linked to the pathogenesis of AD through amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent research has also revealed that GSK 3 β is elevated in AD-affected tissues and is critically involved in dissociating the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC 1) protein from <b>hexokinases,</b> and causing disrupted glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and activating apoptotic cell death. The purpose of this article is to review recent research that is elucidating the role of GSK 3 β in AD pathogenesis. We discuss the involvement of GSK 3 β in the phosphorylation of VDAC 1 and dissociation of VADC 1 with <b>hexokinases</b> in AD neurons...|$|R

25|$|By catalyzing the {{phosphorylation}} of glucose {{to yield}} glucose 6-phosphate, <b>hexokinases</b> maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells. This reaction also initiates all physiologically relevant pathways of glucose utilization, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The {{addition of a}} charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose, and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) within cells, as charged hexose phosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane.|$|R
25|$|In {{patients}} with essential fructosuria, metabolism of fructose by <b>hexokinase</b> to fructose-6-phosphate {{is the primary}} method of metabolizing dietary fructose; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR {{activity}} can have multiple cellular effects. TIGAR {{acts as a}} direct regulator of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels and <b>hexokinase</b> 2 activity, and this can lead indirectly to many changes within the cell in a chain of biochemical events. TIGAR is a fructose bisphosphatase which activates p53, in results of inhibiting the expression of glucose transporter and also regulating the expression of <b>hexokinase</b> and phosphoglycerate mutase. TIGAR also inhibit the Phosphofructokinase (PFK) by lowering the level of fructose-2,6,bisphosphate, therefore, glycolysis is inhibited and pentose phosphate pathway is promoted.|$|E
25|$|During {{a single}} acute {{exercise}} bout, AMPK allows the contracting muscle cells {{to adapt to}} the energy challenges by increasing expression of <b>hexokinase</b> II, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, for glucose uptake, and by stimulating glycolysis. If bouts of exercise continue through a long-term training regimen, AMPK and other signals will facilitate contracting muscle adaptations by escorting muscle cell activity to a metabolic transition resulting in a fatty-acid oxidation approach to ATP generation as opposed to a glycolytic approach. AMPK accomplishes this transition to the oxidative mode of metabolism by upregulating and activating oxidative enzymes such as <b>hexokinase</b> II, PPARalpha, PGC-1, UCP-3, cytochrome C and TFAM.|$|E
40|$|Bacteroides fragilis, a human {{gastrointestinal}} commensal and an opportunistic pathogen, utilizes {{simple and}} complex sugars and polysaccharides for {{growth in the}} large intestine and at sites of infection. Because B. fragilis lacks transport-linked sugar phosphorylation systems, cytoplasmic kinase(s) {{was expected to be}} required for the phosphorylation of hexoses and hexosamines. We have now identified two hexose kinases that are important for growth of B. fragilis on glucose, mannose, and other sugars. One kinase (RokA), a member of the ROK family of proteins, was found to be the sole kinase for activation of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG). The other kinase (HexA) is responsible {{for the majority of the}} glucose kinase activity in the cell, although a hexA deletion mutant strain was not defective for growth on any substrate tested. Deletion of both the rokA and hexA kinase genes resulted in inability of the cell to use glucose, mannose, NAG, and many other sugars. We purified RokA and determined its approximate molecular mass to be 36. 5 kDa. The purified RokA protein was shown to phosphorylate several substrates, including glucose, NAG, and mannose, but not N-acetylmannosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid. Phylogenetic analysis of RokA showed that it is most similar to kinases from the Cytophaga-Flavibacterium-Bacteroides group, while HexA was most similar to other bacterial <b>hexokinases</b> and eukaryotic <b>hexokinases...</b>|$|R
40|$|The uptake of 6 -deoxyglucose was {{measured}} in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in a double mutant strain lacking activity for <b>hexokinases</b> A and B (hxkl hxk 2), in a triple mutant strain lacking activity for both <b>hexokinases</b> and glucokinase (hxkl hxk 2 glk), and in the triple mutant {{with high levels of}} activity of single kinases restored by introduction of the cloned genes. In the wild-type strain, uptake of the glucose analog showed two components, with Km values of ca. 20 mM ("high affinity") and 250 mM ("low affinity"), respectively. The double mutant also had high- and low-affinity components, but the triple mutant showed only low-affinity uptake. Reintroduction of the single kinases to the triple mutant restored high-affinity uptake. (Other experiments on 6 -deoxyglucose uptake are also presented, including the apparent use of the galactose transport system when induced.) These results show that the recent implication of the kinases in transport of glucose (L. F. Bisson and D. G. Fraenkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80 : 1730 - 1734, 1983) applies equally to the nonmetabolized analog 6 -deoxyglucose and suggests that the role of the kinases in transport is not merely a consequence of metabolism of the transported compound...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{glycolysis}} is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes called <b>hexokinases</b> to form glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters. In addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out [...] the cell lacks transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due to the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen.|$|R
