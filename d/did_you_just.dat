5000|$|Another {{favorite}} was a contest between two callers-in {{to speak the}} roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler in the last lines of Gone with the Wind, beginning with the line [...] "I'm leaving you, my dear. All you need now is a divorce and your dreams of Ashley can come true." [...] Caller-in Kim played Scarlett to Spike's Rhett, and then caller-in Robert played Rhett to Spike's Scarlett. (Both contestants spoke with true Southern accents.) Spike ad-libbed many lines. For example, when Kim as Scarlett exclaimed, [...] "Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?" [...] Spike as Rhett replied, not the film's actual line, [...] "I'm going back to Charleston, back where I belong," [...] but: [...] "I'm going to Rick's on Federal Way! Where I belong." [...] (Rick's was a strip club.) When contestant Robert played Rhett and delivered the line, [...] "Here, take my handkerchief," [...] Spike as Scarlett used the handkerchief in a noisy and unladylike way. Listeners who called in got {{to vote on the}} better contestant, and Kim won the prize, probably in part because of her tearful, yearning cries of [...] "Rhett! Rhett!"

5000|$|Back {{in present}} day, Hunter asks Casey {{out on a}} picnic date, and after some hesitation, she accepts. Excited, Hunter dances through the halls and bumps into an Australian student, Chad, {{knocking}} his books askew. Chad seems not to mind and tells Hunter to just pay attention next time. Hunter dresses for his date and asks Jun to please remind him when to leave. A flashback reveals that for important appointments, Hunter is always late because he cannot hear the alarms he sets and the clock always reads 8:13. Hunter heads for his date and is jumped by Chad who apparently is now angry about the earlier altercation. Hunter pleads with Jun who is passing by for help, but Jun screams at Hunter, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> call me?!" [...] and punches Hunter across the face knocking him unconscious. Jun, Chad and another boy tie Hunter up, pull a hood over his face, and drag him to the greenhouse. Hunter awakens to hear his assailants being stabbed. Meanwhile, Casey has arrived by the tree for her date with Hunter, but leaves after waiting for him until the sun sets. Jun finds, unties, and explains to Hunter {{that it was his}} brother who attacked him.|$|E
5000|$|During the night, Gil leaves {{camp and}} {{heads back to}} the site of the gunfight, where he takes a horse and gun from one of the dead {{brothers}} [...] Then he follows Judd, Heck, and Elsa down the only trail. Meanwhile, Heck has shown himself to be trustworthy, and even though he will most likely go to prison, Elsa tells him she'll be there when he gets out. When they reach Elsa's farm, the Hammond brothers are waiting, having already killed her father. A gunfight breaks out and soon both Judd and Heck are wounded. Just then Gil comes riding in to help his old friend, and together the pair insult and challenge the brothers to a face-to-face shootout in the open. When the dust settles, the three brothers are dead, but Judd is mortally wounded. He tells his old friend, [...] "I don't want them to see this. I want to go it alone." [...] When Gil pledges to take care of everything just like he would have, Judd says, [...] "Hell, I know that. I always <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> <b>just</b> forgot it for a while, that's all." [...] Judd casts a look back towards the high country and then dies. The film's final shot is of a mountain in the background.|$|E
5000|$|Emotions play a {{critical}} role in interpersonal relationships and how people relate to each other. Emotional exchanges can have serious social consequences that can result in either maintaining and enhancing positive relationships, or becoming a source of antagonism and discord (Fredrickson, 1998; Gottman & Levenson, 1992)). Even though people may generally [...] "want to feel better than worse" [...] (Larsen, 2000),) how these emotions are regulated may differ across cultures. Research by Yuri Miyamoto suggests that cultural differences influence emotion regulation strategies. Research also indicates that different cultures socialize their children to regulate their emotions according to their own cultural norms. For example, ethnographic accounts suggest that American mothers think that it is important to focus on their children's successes while Chinese mothers think it is more important to provide discipline for their children. [...] To further support this theory, a laboratory experiment found that when children succeeded on a test, American mothers were more likely than Chinese mothers to provide positive feedback (e.g. [...] "You're so smart!"), in comparison to Chinese mothers who provided more neutral or task relevant feedback (e.g. [...] "Did you understand the questions or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> guess?"; Ng, Pomerantz, & Lam, 2007). This shows how American mothers are more likely to [...] "up-regulate" [...] positive emotions by focusing on their children's success whereas Chinese mothers are more likely to [...] "down-regulate" [...] children's positive emotions by not focusing on their success.Americans see emotions as internal personal reactions; emotions are about the self (Markus & Kityama, 1991). In America, emotional expression is encouraged by parents and peers while suppression is often disapproved. Keeping emotions inside is viewed as being insincere as well as posing a risk to one's health and well being. [...] In Japanese cultures however, emotions reflect relationships in addition to internal states. Some research even suggests that emotions that reflect the inner self cannot be separated from emotions that reflect the larger group. Therefore, unlike American culture, expression of emotions is often discouraged, and suppressing one's individual emotions to better fit in with the emotions of the group is looked at as mature and appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2009 {{the band}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, [...] "unforeseen personal matters", as the reason for the cancellations. At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, [...] "We're not splitting. Not at all.

It’s {{going to be one of}} the most explosive episodes ever!" [...] Barrett opined: [...] "it’s one of the best ‘Oaks we’ve ever seen! It’s got a brilliant mix of terror, shock, surprise, and even a bit of humour - and there are some amazing performances from the cast. Claire Cooper is fabulous as always, and watch out for Andrew Moss, Steph Waring and Jazmine Franks, who all act their socks off". Barrett concluded that viewers will not want to miss the fourth episode when [...] "the fallout from the dramatic wedding day continues. There won’t be a dry eye in the house..." [...] Barrett's All About Soap colleague Carena Crawford said: [...] "OMG! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> watch Hollyoaks? Rhys is dead! And so are Maddie and Neil! We’re in shock! We don’t even know where to start: it was so good. With Rhys trapped under the rubble, Cindy wanted to go to him, but she knew she couldn’t. We felt a bit sorry for her, but it was Jacqui who made our hearts break as she stayed by her beloved Rhys’s side as he died". Crawford added that Cooper was [...] "absolutely fantastic" [...] at portraying Jacqui. On Maddie's death, Crawford said: [...] "How brutal was that? After the queen bee saved her own skin by leaving poor Neil to die in pain when the minibus exploded, she was a goner herself after the flaming car door flew off the vehicle and crushed her. Talk about jaw-dropping!" [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said he [...] "really enjoyed Hollyoaks last week and it’s been awhile since I have been thoroughly entertained by the show. Soaps rarely have big splashy events and this soap delivered". He added that he [...] "thought the scenes surrounding the disaster were brilliantly done. Soaps usually don’t do action scenes well, but the car accident, following by the explosion was terrific. They were well shot and suspenseful and you really were on the edge of your seat seeing who would survive - especially since the show had teased that two characters were going to die, though they actually ended up killing off four". He explained that the serial was [...] "determined to keep under-wraps who would die". Langford said he was not shocked at Neil's death, he found Maddie's death to be [...] "a bit of a shock, especially since she had survived the accident, only to be killed by falling debris" [...] and felt Jono's death [...] "was definitely a surprise because it came out of nowhere. One minute he was fine and the next he was dead". Langford said that he was not [...] "shocked" [...] at Rhys' death but that he felt that Moss and Cooper [...] "were beautiful and heartbreaking in those moments".|$|E

During {{difficult}} cognitive activity, for example remembering information, thinking of an answer to a question, planning {{what we are going to}} say, and speaking, we often close our eyes, look up at the sky, or look away from the person we are in conversation with. Adults are very good at switching off from environmental stimulation (both live faces and other sorts of visual display) in order to concentrate better. Until recently we knew very little about whether children use gaze aversion in a similar way. This is a potentially important omission, since the efficiency with which children process information influences many aspects of their development, including school progress. In this article I'll describe what our research team at stirling has been doing to investigate children's gaze aversion, including past and current work. children's patterns of gaze promise to yield important cues to their thinking, concentration and mental processing that will be useful to paretns, teachers, psychologists and anyone engaged in assessing children's knowledge and development...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that memory for personal experiences (episodic memory, rather than semantic memory) relies on the conscious review of past experience and thus is unique to humans. In an attempt to demonstrate episodic-like memory in animals, we first trained pigeons {{to respond to the}} (nonverbal) question “Did you just peck or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> refrain from pecking? ” by training them on a symbolic matching task with differential responding required to the two line-orientation samples and reinforcing the choice of a red comparison if they had pecked and the choice of a green comparison if they had not pecked. Then, in Experiment 1, after providing the conditions for (but not requiring) the pigeons to peck at one new stimulus (a yellow hue) but not at another (a blue hue), we tested them with the new hue stimuli and the red and green comparisons. In Experiment 2, we tested the pigeons with novel stimuli (a circle, which they spontaneously pecked, and a dark response key, which they did not peck) and the red and green comparisons. In both experiments, pigeons chose the comparison appropriate to the response made to the test stimulus. Thus, the pigeons demonstrated that they could remember specific details about their past experiences, a result consistent with the notion that they have the capacity for forming episodic-like memories. Current views of human memory divide it according t...|$|E
