25|$|Because {{the night}} that the woman ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> (21, 48, 54). In United States, prophylactic treatment is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, amniocentesis still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for those women who require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using cell-free fetal DNA may ultimately replace this invasive procedure.|$|E

25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; they rolled bandages, knitted socks, mitts, sweaters, and scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised money to send cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic feeling to Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her book}} Native Speakers, Cotera {{argues that the}} {{significance}} of the co-authorship of this novel has often been ignored, under analyzed, and wrongly criticized. [...] The novel has been criticized and rejected by both Chicana/o scholars and historically white publishers because of the unique collaboration between González and Eimer. [...] This {{played a significant role in}} the failure of getting Caballero published during their lifetimes. [...] González was extremely frustrated by this during her life. [...] There has, however, been a strong counterargument to these rejections that considers the power of these two women from such different backgrounds speaking out together against [...] "the singularity of patriarchal thinking and its bankrupt formulations of identity and authority". Another fascinating component of this collaboration is that it simultaneously tells the Mexican side of the war and reflects a partnership between a Mexican-American and Anglo-American author. [...] Cotera argues that it is only natural <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> to work together as [...] "the notion of a singular author is a construct of modernity that is inextricably linked ‘to the development of modern capitalism and of intellectual property, to Western rationalism, and to patriarchy’". [...] Caballero works to undo this discourse through collaboration as when you write together [...] "you have to desire the collaborative world under formation more than the unextended ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ of the old power structures".|$|E

To appreciate the full grimness of the sarcasm hear it from their lips amid their own surroundings. I winked with vigour to show that I appreciated Life and was a real chippy, and that upon me, too, there were no flies. There is an intoxication in company that carries a man to excess of mirth; but when a party of four deliberately sit down to drink and swear, the bottom tumbles out of the amusement somehow, and loathing and boredom follow. A night's reflection has convinced {{me that there is}} no hell <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> in another world. They have their own in this Life, and I have been through it a little way. Still carrying the brevet rank of doctor, it was my duty to watch through the night to the dawn a patient--gay, toujours gay, remember--quivering {{on the verge of a}} complaint called the [...] "jumps."

60|$|And, after all, {{will it be}} {{the worse}} <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>women,</b> or for the society in which they live, if they do {{interest}} themselves in politics? Might not (as Mr. Boyd Kinnear urges in an article as sober and rational as it is earnest and chivalrous) their purity and earnestness help to make {{what is now called}} politics somewhat more pure, somewhat more earnest? Might not the presence of the voting power of a few virtuous, experienced, well- educated women, keep candidates, for very shame, from saying and doing things from which they do not shrink, before a crowd of men who are, on the average, neither virtuous, experienced, or well-educated, by wholesome dread of that most terrible of all earthly punishments--at least in the eyes of a manly man--the fine scorn of a noble woman? Might not the intervention of a few women who are living according to the eternal laws of God, help to infuse some slightly stronger tincture of those eternal laws into our legislators and their legislation? What women have done for the social reforms of the last forty years is known, or ought to be known, to all. Might not they have done far more, and might not they do far more hereafter, if they, who generally know far more than men do of human suffering, and of the consequences of human folly, were able to ask for further social reforms, not merely as a boon to be begged from the physically stronger sex, but as their will, which they, as citizens, have a right to see fulfilled, if just and possible?
