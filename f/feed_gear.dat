40|$|The {{necessity}} of mechanization of coal extraction in Jiu Valley mines, in {{the conditions of}} the present economic crisis, involved the adaptation of the existing equipments to the new conditions of reequipping of certain faces. Thus, within the program of reequipping of a longwall in Lonea Mining Plant, the adaptation of 2 K - 52 MU cutting and loading machine to TR - 5 scraper conveyer was required. The ma in problem of adaptation of the two equipments was in the design and development of systems for affixing the ends of the <b>feeding</b> <b>gear</b> chain of the machine to the driving and returning stations of the TR - 5 scraper conveyer. In solving this problem, the focu s was on ensuring for all the elements of the attaching system of the ends of the machine chain to resist to the machine’s maximum haulage force of 250 kN, and this strain not to be transmitted to the metal structure of the stations and be taken over by th e hydraulic prop of anchorage of the conveyer statio...|$|R

When modificating saw blades it is possible to avoid partially these problems and achieve the maximum cutting quality and productivity. The thesis also examines the impact of the noise on human body and proposes measures designed to reduce noise of the saw blades.

50|$|The Staghound was an {{innovative}} design that incorporated some advanced features. It had two rear-facing 6-cylinder engines with automatic transmissions (with 4 forward and 1 reverse <b>gears)</b> <b>feeding</b> through a transfer case to drive both axles. Either two- or four-wheel drive could be selected. Either engine could {{be shut down}} while in motion and {{taken out of the}} drive train. Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the driver's instrument panel depending on steering conditions. Steering and suspension components were directly attached to the hull as the structure was rigid enough to dispense with the need for a separate chassis.|$|R

5000|$|The model A had an {{optional}} inch or metric screw-cutting gearbox and power cross-feed. The {{addition of the}} letters, [...] "UD" [...] to the model letter signifies [...] "Under Drive". Model AUD is a Model A with the Under Drive mount. The four lathes (A,B, C, and T) were dimensionally identical but with different features.

Model C had manual cross-feed and manual gear change for screw cutting. Model T was the Training lathe. The VSL (for late machines, VSL500) was an AUD with infinitely-variable spindle speed control, larger bore through spindle, 'L00' fitting for chucks instead of the threaded fitting of the other models and some other uprated features making it more attractive to industry. The lathes were based on the design of the very successful American South Bend Lathe models.|$|R
40|$|Culture of {{groupers}} in {{ponds and}} floating net cages has been practiced {{for many years}} in the Philippines. Unsustainable culture practices such as dependence on wild caught seeds, use of trash fish, use of high stocking densities, and unregulated expansion and proliferation of fish cages, have led to the "boom and bust" cycle of grouper aquaculture in the Philippines. The drastic decrease in grouper aquaculture production in the late 90 's was mainly attributed to environmental deterioration and diseases outbreaks. To sustain grouper production, research on the breeding, seed production and culture of groupers started in the mid 1980 s. As a regional inter-government R&D organization, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD) followed the recommendations of the 1987 Seminar-Workshop on Aquaculture Development in Southeast Asia on grouper R&D. Research activities initially focused on market survey of grouper species in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, assessment of fry and availability in traditional fishing grounds, and development of broodstock management techniques. Following the spontaneous spawning of Epinephelus coioides in concrete tanks and floating net cages in 1990 's, protocols for the seed production of milkfish and sea bass were adapted and modified. Parallel studies to determine sustainable culture techniques in ponds and net cages were conducted. Studies on the nutritional requirements of grouper at various developmental stages were done to reduce dependence on live prey organisms and trash fish as <b>feeds.</b> Research <b>geared</b> towards health management started in the in late 90 's to early 2000 's. Prospects for grouper aquaculture are discussed in the light of recent advances in grouper R&D and the Government of the Philippines initiatives to increase fish production by mariculture...|$|R
40|$|The {{positioning}} accuracy of rotary feed system under load greatly {{depends on the}} static stiffness of mechanical transmission system. This paper proposes a unified static stiffness model of rotary <b>feed</b> system with <b>geared</b> transmission system. Taking the torsional stiffness of transmission shaft and mesh stiffness of gear pairs into account, the motion equations of the whole transmission system are presented. Based on the static equilibrium, a unified expression {{for the relationship between}} torsional angles of two adjacent elements is derived. Then a unified static stiffness model is presented. Furthermore, analytical expressions for sensitivity analysis of the static stiffness on the individual element’s stiffness and design parameters are derived. The presented model is verified by a traditional model, and a good agreement is obtained. The influence of phase angle of meshing gear pairs on the resultant static stiffness is investigated. An example transmission system is employed to perform the sensitivity analysis and the results are analyzed. The proposed model provides an essential tool for the design of rotary feed system satisfying requirement of static stiffness. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} works {{through a}} set of gears on the follow focus that are attached to teeth on the focus ring of the lens. These <b>gears</b> <b>feed</b> to a wheel that, when turned by a focus puller, spins the teeth and thus the ring on the lens. Practically, the device is not necessary as the operator can directly turn the ring on the lens. However, this would place the hand in an awkward position perpendicular to the camera rather than parallel, and turning beyond a certain distance (such as 360 degrees) would be impossible. Sometimes, such a [...] "focus pull" [...] would even be difficult with a follow focus, so an L-shaped metal rod called a speed crank can be attached in the provided square hole {{at the center of the}} wheel. Thus, the hand merely has to spin the rod, which turns the wheel. If it is necessary for the operator to stand a short distance from the camera, e.g., if the camera is inconveniently high, a short flexible cable called a [...] "focus whip" [...] can be used.|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} future goals of higher {{productivity}} and lower production costs, the cutting speeds and <b>feeds</b> in modern <b>gear</b> hobbing applications {{have to increase}} further. In several cases, coated carbide tools have replaced the commonly used high speed steel (HSS) tools. Because this leads to production processes working on the upper limit of their performance capabilities, the tolerances for deviations from the optimum process settings are getting smaller. To deal with this situation, especially in carbide bobbing, all factors that have an influence on the hobbing process - like the workpiece geometry, the process parameters and especially the tool design - {{have to be taken}} into account if a high level of process performance is desired. This essay will present a case study based on two industrial gearings. The investigations include the influence of coating, substrate, layout and edge preparation on tool performance. In detail, fundamental baseline trials using "fly-cutter hobbing" will be presented. Besides several coating and substrate combinations, different tool layouts have also been tested. To verify the results, real hobbing trials under industrial production conditions have been carried out as well. Finally, the potential of modern simulation and calculation programs to optimize hobbing processes will be shown. The report aims to give new impulses to the tool design of carbide hobs and to an optimized process setting...|$|R
