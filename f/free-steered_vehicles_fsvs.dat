5000|$|... (Philippine Army): 120 M113A1 {{units were}} {{acquired}} from 1967 onwards. Some {{of which were}} converted into fire support <b>vehicles</b> (<b>FSV)</b> and mortar carriers. 114 M113A2 units were acquired from the U.S. Army and another 28 M113A2 units are bought to be upgraded by Elbit Systems as fire support <b>vehicles</b> (<b>FSV)</b> and armoured recovery vehicles (ARV).

5000|$|M113A2 Fire Support <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>FSV)</b> - 14 Fire Support <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>FSV)</b> will be {{equipped}} with the turrets of decommissioned Alvis Scorpion armoured reconnaissance vehicles, a new fire control system and thermal imaging system. The two-person Scorpion turret is armed with a 76 mm L23A1 gun and a 7.62 mm co-axial machine gun (MG) with day/image intensification sights. Four of the M113A2 will {{be equipped}} a 25 mm cannon mounted in an Elbit Remote Control Weapon Station (RC WS), six will have an RC WS mounting a 12.7mm machine gun.|$|R
50|$|The Fire Support <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>FSV)</b> of the Stryker series {{provides}} automated enhanced surveillance, target acquisition, target identification, target tracking, target designation, position {{location and}} communications functionality.

50|$|The 30 mm gun {{machine is}} used against ground and low flying air targets {{with a range}} of 2 km against ground targets and 4 km against helicopters. Other {{proposed}} versions include a fire support <b>vehicle</b> (<b>FSV)</b> with a 155 mm howitzer, and an air defense vehicle fitted with automatic cannons.|$|R
5000|$|M113A1 Fire Support <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>FSV)</b> - Full {{designation}} Carrier, Fire Support, Full Track M113A1 (FS) Saladin Turret was {{a variant}} fitted with the turret from the Alvis Saladin armored car. The FSV was introduced into Australian Army {{units in the}} mid-1960s following {{the withdrawal of the}} Saladins and was armed with a 76mm gun, a [...]30 caliber coaxial machine gun and a [...]30 caliber machine gun mounted {{on the roof of the}} vehicle's turret. The M113 was an interim vehicle and was replaced by the M113 Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle in the late 1970s. It was commonly referred to by Royal Australian Armoured Corps crews as the [...] "Beast".|$|R
50|$|In addition, the Australians {{operated}} an M113 variant {{fitted with}} a Saladin armored car turret, with a 76 mm gun as a fire support <b>vehicle,</b> or <b>FSV,</b> for infantry fire support. This has now also been removed from service.|$|R
50|$|The FSV {{is based}} on the ICV due to the close {{parallels}} of operational requirements between the two <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>FSV</b> is an organic vehicle to the ICV maneuver formation and helps maximize commonality of the platform while simultaneously reducing the maintenance footprint and variety of logistics support.|$|R
25|$|In mid-1971 'A' Squadron {{received}} six M113A1 Fire Support <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>FSV),</b> each {{armed with}} 76mm gun mounted in a Saladin turret. The FSV was more heavily armed than the M113A1 carrier {{but was still}} only lightly protected, being designed for defensive tasks to free the Centurion tanks for offensive operations. However, in August the Australian government announced that 1 ATF would be withdrawn from Vietnam, beginning a drawdown of forces. In October the remaining troops moved to Vung Tau; however, a company from the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment/NZ (ANZAC) with a troop of APCs and support personnel remained at Nui Dat. In December the bulk of 'A' Squadron returned to Australia, while No. 1 Troop later moved to Vung Tau before returning to Australia in March 1972.|$|R

50|$|Numerous Saladin {{survive in}} Australia, {{one example is}} {{on display at the}} RAAC Memorial and Tank Museum Puckapunyal, Victoria. and another {{complete}} operational, privately owned ex-British Saladin exists in the outer metropolitan region of Sydney. Many ex-Australian Army Saladins remain turretless because of the fitting of Saladin turrets on M113 carriers to make the Fire Support <b>Vehicle</b> (M113-A1 <b>FSV)</b> used in the Vietnam war.Two Saladin's are on display at the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum located in Cairns, Queensland. One as the Gate Guard and the second (on display) is in running condition.|$|R
40|$|Most {{automotive}} companies outsource the design, {{manufacturing and}} assembly of some complete cars to independent suppliers or full service <b>vehicle</b> companies (<b>FSVs).</b> FSVs represent a relatively unexplored form of outsourcing which combines joint efforts {{in developing a}} modular product with the externalisation of specific niche manufacturing processes. On the basis of comparative cases and of qualitative information collected within three FSVs and three OEMs, this study aims to investigate the associated advantages and risks for FSVs, commonalities/differences from the practices of outsourcing to component/module specialists {{that can be found}} in other industries and why and for what kind of products FSVs can be appropriate in automotive supply networks. The study contributes to the debate on outsourcing in the automotive industry by providing an original interpretation on why FSVs have recently seen a shakeout with some growing whilst others have faltered...|$|R
5000|$|The Australian Army mounted Saladin turrets on M113A1 APCs {{to produce}} the Fire Support <b>Vehicle.</b> A new <b>FSV</b> based on the British FV101 Scorpion Light Tank turret was {{accepted}} for service in 1976, the first RAAC AFV fitted with a passive (image intensifying) night sight; this was redesignated the Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle (MRV). Royal Australian Armoured Corps(RAAC) personnel referred to the resulting vehicles as [...] "Beasts". The Sri Lanka Armoured Corps used Saladins extensively {{during the early stages}} of the Sri Lankan Civil War; they remained in reserve status till the end of the war in 2009. It forms the tank crew pin of the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps.|$|R
40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid en 2016. Directores de la Tesis: Antonio J. Caamaño Fernández y Julio Ramiro BargueñoThis Doctoral Thesis {{is about}} the {{characterization}} of traffic flow using data from {{a small part of}} the vehicles that comprise such flow. We propose the use of an ad-hoc wireless network formed by a fraction of the passing vehicles, the probe or sensor vehicles, to periodically recover their positions and speeds. These vehicles, together with wireless bridges located close to the road shoulder, the Road Side Units (RSU), compose the Vehicular Sensor Network. Gathered data are then rearranged in a time-space diagram as a part of microscopic traffic flow representation. Finally, the speed/position information or Space-Time Velocity (STV) field is reconstructed in a Data Fusion Center by means of interpolation techniques. We have used widely accepted theoretical traffic models (car-following, multi-lane and overtakeenabled) to replicate the nonlinear characteristics of the traffic flow in representative situations along several experiments with different traffic-related parameters. In order to obtain realistic packet losses, we have simulated the multihop ad-hoc wireless network with an IEEE 802. 11 p PHY layer. The interpolation is based on the generation of Triangular Irregular Network, to our knowledge, is the first time such a interpolation is used in traffic context. In addition, we have performed discrete optimization to recover the most relevant time-space regions (cells) and the relation of such cells with traffic flow and the ocurrence of probe vehicles. Finally, we have derived a local density-flow diagram from sensor vehicles which occurs in selected cells. This Doctoral Thesis conclude that: 1) for relevant configurations of both sensor vehicle and RSU densities, the wireless multihop channel performance does not critically affect the STV reconstruction error; 2) the system performance is marginally affected by transmission errors for realistic traffic conditions, 3) the STV field can be recovered with minimal error for a very small Fraction of Sensor <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>FSV)</b> 9 % in any traffic condition, it can be further reduced for congested traffic; 4) for that FSV value, the probability that at least one sensor vehicle transits the spatio-temporal regions that contribute the most to reduce the STV reconstruction error, sharply tends to 1. 5) In addition, for certain traffic conditions, the local density-flow diagram is rendered from a mere 3 %. Thus, a random and sparse selection of wireless sensor vehicles in realistic traffic conditions, together with the proper interpolation and space-time data analysis techniques, is sufficient to get an accurate reconstruction of any STV field...|$|R
