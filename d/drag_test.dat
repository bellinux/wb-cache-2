40|$|The physico-chemical {{properties}} and in vivo efficacies of two nanoparticulate systems delivering the antiparkinsonian drug bromocriptine (BC) were compared {{in the present}} study. Monoolein aqueous dispersions (MAD) and Nanostructured Lipid Carrier (NLC) were produced and characterized. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and X-ray diffraction revealed the morphology of MAD and NLC. Dimensional distribution was determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and Sedimentation Field Flow Fractionation (SdFFF). In particular, BC was shown to be encapsulated with high entrapment efficiency both in MAD and in NLC, according to SdFFF combined with HPLC. Two behavioral tests specific for akinesia (bar test) or akinesia/bradykinesia (<b>drag</b> <b>test)</b> were {{used to compare the}} effects of the different BC formulations on motor disabilities in 6 -hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats in vivo, a model of Parkinson’s disease. Both free BC and BC-NLC reduced the immobility time in the bar test and enhanced the number of steps in the <b>drag</b> <b>test,</b> although the effects of encapsulated BC were longer lasting (5 hr). Conversely, BC-MAD was ineffective in the bar test and improved stepping activity in the <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> to a much lower degree than those achieved with the other preparations. We conclude that MAD and NLC can encapsulate BC, although only NLC provide long-lasting therapeutic effects possibly extending BC half-life in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In a multi-center {{study the}} power output of {{wheelchair}} propulsion, attained by a wheelchair <b>drag</b> <b>test,</b> differed among rehabilitation centers. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate what causes the differences in drag force among centers. Methods: A set of standardized drag tests was performed while systematically varying the calibration set of the force transducer, the tester and the wheelchair. In addition, the actual calibrated velocity and slope of the treadmill were measured. Results: Difference in drag force among centers was due to variation in wheelchair set-up and differences in the slopes between treadmills. The drag force was not significantly different when different testers performed the test. The belt velocity in almost all centers was lower than the manufacturer specified (assumed) velocity. Conclusion: The <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> appeared a robust test as far as the tester is considered. Variation in wheelchairs and differences in the actual slopes of the treadmills affected the imposed drag force. The assumed velocity of the treadmill led to an overestimation of the power output. The power output in the multi-center study should be recalculated using the measured velocities and the wheelchair set-up should be more standardized. © 2005 IPEM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether a new footwear outsole with tread blocks and a hy-brid rubber surface pattern, composed of rough and smooth surfaces, could increase slip resistance {{and reduce the}} risk of fall while walking on a wet floor surface. A <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> was performed to mea-sure static and dynamic coefficient of friction (SCOF and DCOF, respectively) values for the foot-wear with the hybrid rubber surface pattern outsole and two types of commercially available boots that are conventionally used in food factories and restaurant kitchens with respect to a stainless steel floor covered with glycerol solution.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{discusses}} {{issues concerning}} the validation of solutions of con-struction problems in Dynamic Geometry Environments (DGEs) {{as compared to}} classic paper-and-pencil Euclidean geometry settings. We begin by comparing the validation criteria usually associated with solutions of construction problems in the two geometry worlds – the ‘drag test ’ in DGEs {{and the use of}} only straightedge and compass in classic Euclidean geometry. We then demonstrate that the <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> criterion may permit con-structions created using measurement tools to be considered valid; however, these con-structions prove inconsistent with classical geometry. This inconsistency {{raises the question of whether}} dragging is an adequate test of validity, and the issue of measurement versus straightedge-and-compass. Without claiming that the inconsistency between what counts as valid solution of a construction problem in the two geometry worlds is neces-sarily problematic, we examine what would constitute the analogue of the straightedge-and-compass criterion in the domain of DGEs. Discovery of this analogue would enrich our understanding of DGEs with a mathematical idea that has been the distinguishing feature of Euclidean geometry since its genesis. To advance our goal, we introduce the compatibility criterion, a new but not necessarily superior criterion to the <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> cri-terion of validation of solutions of construction problems in DGEs. The discussion of the two criteria anatomizes the complexity characteristic of the relationship between DGEs and the paper-and-pencil Euclidean geometry environment, advances our understanding of the notion of geometrical constructions in DGEs, and raises the issue of validation practice maintaining the pace of ever-changing software...|$|E

40|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine noise source separation process, the combustion noise and the piston slap noise are found to be seriously aliased in time-frequency domain. It is difficult to accurately separate them. Therefore, the noise source separation method which is based on Gammatone filter bank and robust independent component analysis (RobustICA) is proposed. The 6 -cylinder {{internal combustion engine}} vibration and noise test are carried out in a semianechoic chamber. The lead covering method is adopted to isolate the interference noise from numbers 1 to 5 cylinder parts, with only the number 6 cylinder parts left bare. Firstly, many mode components of the measured near-field radiated noise signals are extracted through the designed Gammatone filter bank. Then, the RobustICA algorithm is utilised to extract the independent components. Finally, the spectrum analysis, the continuous wavelet time-frequency analysis, the correlation function method, and the <b>drag</b> <b>test</b> are employed to further identify the separation results. The research results show that the frequency of the combustion noise and the piston slap noise are, respectively, concentrated at 4025 [*]Hz and 1725 [*]Hz.

Three microdialysis probes were simultaneously {{implanted in the}} dopamine-depleted striatum, globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticulata of 6 -hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats. The NR 2 A antagonist NVP-AAM 077 perfused in the striatum reduced pallidal GABA, but not glutamate, levels whereas the NR 2 B antagonist Ro 25 - 6981 was ineffective. Neither antagonist affected striatal or nigral amino acid levels. To investigate whether these neurochemical responses were predictive of different antiparkinsonian activities, antagonists were administered systemically and motor activity evaluated in different motor tasks. Neither antagonist attenuated akinesia/bradykinesia in the bar and <b>drag</b> <b>test.</b> However, NVP-AAM 077 dually modulated rotarod performance (low doses being facilitatory and higher ones inhibitory) while Ro 25 - 6981 monotonically improved it. Microdialysis revealed that motor facilitating doses reduced pallidal GABA levels while motor inhibiting doses increased them. We conclude that, under parkinsonian conditions, the striato-pallidal pathway is driven by striatal NR 2 A subunits. Motor improvement induced by NVP-AAM 077 and Ro 25 - 6981 is accomplished by blockade of striatal NR 2 A and extrastriatal NR 2 B subunits, respectively...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production, characterization and in vivo activity of lipid nanocarriers (LN) containing a levodopa prodrug (LD-PD) with therapeutic potential in Parkinson’s disease. LD is {{the mainstay of}} the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson’s disease. However, after a good initial response, motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and loss of efficacy, develop over time, partly due to oscillations in plasma and brain levels of the drug. LD-PD was produced {{with the aim of}} prolonging the pharmacological activity of LD. To improve solubility, and simultaneously provide a long lasting release and therapeutic efficacy, the prodrug was formulated in tristearin/lecithin LN. The obtained formulation was homogeneous in particle size and remained stable for up to two months from preparation. For the three different tested LD concentrations, namely 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5. 0 mg/ml, the morphological characterization revealed no substantial differences between unloaded and LD-PD loaded LN. The calorimetric test showed an interaction between the lipid phase and the loaded prodrug. In vitro studies using the dialysis method and enzymatic degradation procedure showed that the LD-PD loaded LN provided a controlled prodrug release. Finally, two behavioural tests specific to akinesia (bar test) or akinesia/bradykinesia (<b>drag</b> <b>test)</b> performed in 6 -hydroxydopamine hemilesioned mice (a model of Parkinson’s disease) demonstrated that the LD-PD loaded LN attenuated parkinsonian disabilities, showing a slightly reduced maximal efficacy but a longer lasting action (up to 24 hours) than an equal dose of LD.
