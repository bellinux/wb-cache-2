5|$|In the Sybertsville quadrangle, the {{surficial}} <b>geology</b> in {{the valley}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly consists of alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and some small patches of Wisconsinan Till. The surficial <b>geology</b> on the valley slopes and uplands mainly consists of bedrock. In the quadrangle of Freeland, the surficial <b>geology</b> near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvium. The surficial <b>geology</b> near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Edinburgh in 1827, Darwin learnt about marine {{invertebrates}} while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant, and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831, he had studied <b>geology</b> under Adam Sedgwick. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine <b>geology</b> on land while the ship's complement carried out its hydrographic survey. FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's Principles of <b>Geology</b> before they left. On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on <b>geology.</b> Lyell's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters, and the second volume, which was sent to Darwin during the voyage, gave more detail. Darwin received it in November 1832.|$|E

Its exhibits showcase the natural history of New Jersey; focusing <b>geology,</b> paleontology, and anthropology. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from Franklin and Ogdensburg, a mastodon from Salem County, a dinosaur trackway discovered in Towaco, and a Ptolemaic era Egyptian mummy.|$|E

50|$|Stewart {{has been}} {{described}} as 'one of those exceptional individuals for whom the word polymath was minted.' His professional life coincided both with an increase in <b>geology's</b> profile, and the moment that science policy became more widely publicly debated, {{as a result of the}} development of the discipline of plate tectonics, as well as <b>geology's</b> economic value, particularly in the fields of the development of North Sea oil and lunar and interplanetary exploration, both of which were growth industries at the time.|$|R
