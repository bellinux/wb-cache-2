5000|$|The {{standard}} interior {{features of}} the 1965 Mustang included adjustable driver and passenger bucket seats, an AM radio, and a floor mounted shifter {{in a variety of}} color options. Ford added additional interior options during the 1965 model year. The Interior Decor Group was popularly known as [...] "Pony Interior" [...] due to the addition of embossed running ponies on the seat fronts, and also included integral armrests, woodgrain appliqué accents, and a round gauge cluster that would replace the standard Falcon instrumentation. Also available were sun visors, a (mechanical) remote-operated mirror, a floor console, and a bench seat. Ford later offered an under-dash air-conditioning unit, and discontinued the vinyl with cloth <b>insert</b> <b>seat</b> option, offered only in early 1965 models. One option designed strictly for fun was the Rally-Pac. Introduced in 1963 after Ford's success at that year's Monte Carlo Rally and available on other Ford and Mercury compacts and intermediates, the Rally-Pac was a combination clock and tachometer mounted to the steering column. It was available as a factory ordered item for US$69.30. Installed by a dealer, the Rally-Pac cost US$75.95.A 14" [...] rim option was available for Rally-pac and GT350R vehicles widening front and rear track to 57.5". Reproductions are presently available from any number of Mustang restoration parts sources. A compass, rear seat belts, A/C, and back-up lights were also optional.|$|E
40|$|Since {{more and}} more {{products}} are custom made the manufacturers are facing increasing demands requiring both time and cost efficiency. With conventional manufacturing methods it is often costly to produce custom made products in low volumes due to large initial onetime costs for machines, setup etcetera. Today {{it is possible to}} produce real, working products in metal materials with additive techniques such as laser sintering. Small grains of metal are melted or sintered together using a thin laser beam, creating precise geometries directly from a CAD-file. This thesis work was carried out at the CTSP department at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The purpose is to show what kind of functional and design improvements can be achieved with the manufacturing technique as well as what limitations it implies. This is to be made by exemplifying a redevelopment of a Corocut insert holder for grooving operations. The aim is to successfully produce a functional insert holder conformal to the limitations of additive manufacturing. An analysis of the design process when designing for additive manufacturing should also be generated. The redeveloped insert holder had a decreased volume and a more slimmed design. Instead of a cooling channel with a diameter of 3 mm two channels with a diameter of 2 mm and 1 mm was added. The acute angles could be eliminated by using additive manufacturing, creating a better flow of the cutting fluid. The hinge was moved and more chip space could be generated. The insert holder was laser sintered in a machine from Concept laser. The additive process was made on top of a Capto coupling which had been sent to the manufacturer. Operations to create the <b>insert</b> <b>seat</b> and the clamping were made afterwards. Testes showed a well functional insert holder for grooving with a very gathered fluid jet from the 1 mm cooling channel and good chip breaks. The manufacturing technique is applicable for Sandvik Coromant products, although the exact product areas need to be analysed. Examples of potential areas are for products with high demands on the cooling channels, spare parts, or areas where having different materials in the same geometry can be an advantage. The manufacturing technique is most suited for custom made (special) products, though the profit opportunities have not been analysed. Although, manufacturing products with additive techniques give a lot of freedom to the designers and make it possible to produce products that have not been possible before. Unique design and functions in a product may very well compensate for the higher price the customer has to pay. Validerat; 20110124 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|The {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out, where the object has been the set of two friction couples: valve stem – valve guide and valve <b>seat</b> – <b>seat</b> <b>insert.</b> The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and valve acceleration, the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for valve guide and for <b>seat</b> <b>insert,</b> sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between valve stem and valve guide, the impact force for valve impacting <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> and valve guides made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its <b>seat</b> <b>insert.</b> The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and valve acceleration has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|R
40|$|Controlling the {{temperature}} of the exhaust valves is paramount for proper functioning of engines and for the long lifespan of valve train components. The majority of the heat outflow from the valve takes place along the valve-seat-cylinder head-coolant thermal path which is significantly influenced by the thermal contact resistance (TCR) present at the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. A test rig facility and experimental procedure were successfully developed to assess the effect of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces on heat outflow from the valve, in particular the effects of the valve/seat interface geometry, <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> assembly method, i. e. press or shrink fit, and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> metallic coating on the operating temperature of the valve. The results of tests have shown that the degree of the valve-seat geometric conformity is more significant than the thermal conductivity of the insert: for low conforming assemblies, the mean valve head temperature recorded during tests on copper-infiltrated <b>insert</b> <b>seats</b> was higher than that recorded during tests on noninfiltrated seats of higher conformance. The effect of the insert-cylinder head assembly method, i. e. shrink-fitted versus press-fitted inserts, has proved negligible: results have shown insignificant valve head temperature variations, for both tin-coated and uncoated inserts. On the other hand, coating the <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> with a layer of tin (20 - 22 ¿m) reduced the mean valve head temperature by approximately 15 °C as measured during tests on uncoated seats. The analysis of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces has indicated that the surface asperities of the softer metal in contact would undergo plastic deformation. Suitable thermal contact conductance (TCC) models, available in the public domain, were used to evaluate the conductance for the valve/seat and seat/cylinder head interfaces. Finally, a FE thermal model of the test rig has been developed with a view to assess the quality of the calculated TCC values for the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. The results of the thermal analysis have shown that predicted temperatures at chosen control points agree with those measured during tests on thermometric seats with an acceptable level of accuracy, proving the effectiveness of the used TCC models.

40|$|Valve <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. Valve and valve seat embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the valve seat during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the valve seat and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4. Based on the simulation result, it is observed that the change in gap width between valve seat and cylinder head will interfere the eddy current path which caused in the change of induced current density and magnetic flux density...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Under actual engine driving conditions, {{there is}} a {{possibility}} of engine valve and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear occurring as a result of various speed changes and accumulation of mileage. It is therefore necessary to examine the wear-related problems of engine valves and <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> and to determine by comparison whether speed or mileage inflicts the greater wear. This work focuses on the various degrees of wear produced at three different singular test speeds (10 Hz, 25 Hz, and multi-Hz) and two different cycle numbers (2. 1 × 106 and 6. 0 × 106). Throughout all tests performed in this study, the temperature of the outer surface of the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> was controlled at 350 °C and the test load was 1960 N. Wear depths were measured using a confocal laser microscope, and wear mechanisms were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The extent of wear produced at higher speeds (25 Hz) was found to be greater than that produced at lower speeds (10 Hz) under identical test conditions (temperature, valve displace-ment, cycle number, and test load). Although test cycle numbers were increased by a factor of 3, for example from 2. 1 × 106 to 6. 0 × 106, the wear depths were not proportionally increased.
