40|$|Background During reverse transcription, retroviruses {{duplicate}} the long terminal repeats (LTRs). These identical LTRs carry both promoter regions and functional polyadenylation sites. To express full-length transcripts, retroviruses have to suppress polyadenylation in the 5 ′LTR and activate polyadenylation in the 3 ′LTR. <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have a unique}} LTR structure {{with respect to the}} location of the major splice donor (MSD), which is located upstream of the polyadenylation signal. Results Here, we describe the mechanisms of <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> regulating polyadenylation. We show that binding of the U 1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U 1 snRNP) to the MSD suppresses polyadenylation at the 5 ′LTR. In contrast, polyadenylation at the 3 ′LTR is achieved by adoption of a different RNA structure at the MSD region, which blocks U 1 snRNP binding and furthers RNA cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation. Conclusion Recently, it was shown that U 1 snRNP is able to suppress the usage of intronic cryptic polyadenylation sites in the cellular genome. <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> take advantage of this surveillance mechanism to suppress premature polyadenylation at the 5 ’end of their RNA. At the 3 ’end, <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> use a secondary structure to presumably block access of U 1 snRNP and thereby activate polyadenylation {{at the end of the}} genome.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{exogenous}} complex retroviruses {{that are}} highly endemic in several animal species, including monkeys and apes, where they cause persistent infection. Simian foamy viral (SFV) infection {{has been reported in}} few persons occupationally exposed to non-human primates (NHP) in zoos, primate centers and laboratories, and recently in few hunters from central Africa. Most of the epidemiological works performed among NHP populations concern cross-sectional studies without long-term follow-up. Therefore, the exact timing and the modes of transmission of SFVs remain not well known, although sexual and oral transmissions have been suspected. We have conducted a longitudinal study in a free-breeding colony of Macaca tonkeana in order (1) to determine the prevalence of the infection by <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses,</b> (2) to characterize molecularly the viruses infecting such animals, (3) to study their genetic variability overtime by long-term follow-up of several DNA samples in a series of specific animals, and (4) to get new insights concerning the timing and the modes of SFVs primary infection in these monkeys by combining serology and molecular means, as well as studies of familial structures and long-term behavioral observations. Results/conclusion We first demonstrated that this colony was highly endemic for SFVs, with a clear increase of seroprevalence with age. Only 4. 7 % of immatures, and 43, 7 % of sub-adults were found seropositive, while 89. 5 % of adults exhibited antibodies directed against SFV. We further showed that 6 different strains of <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (exhibiting a very low intra-strain and overtime genetic variability in the integrase gene) are circulating within this group. This suggests a possible infection by different strains within an animal. Lastly, we provide strong evidence that <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> are mostly acquired through severe bites, mainly in sub-adults or young adults. Most cases of seroconversion occur after 7 years of age; from this age individuals competed for access to sexual partners, thus increasing the likelihood of being wounded. Furthermore, all the serological and molecular data, obtained in this free-breeding colony, argue against a significant transmission of SFVs from mother or father to infants as well as between siblings. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (FV) {{are complex}} retroviruses which are {{widespread}} in many species. Despite being discovered over 40 years ago, FV {{are among the}} least well characterized retroviruses. The replication of these viruses is different in many interesting respects from that of all other retroviruses. Infection of natural hosts by FV leads to a lifelong persistent infection, without any evidence of pathology. A large {{number of studies have}} looked at the prevalence of primate <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> in the human population. Many of these studies have suggested that FV infections are prevalent in some human populations and are associated with specific diseases. More recent data, using more rigorous criteria for the presence of viruses, have not confirmed these studies. Thus, while FV are ubiquitous in all nonhuman primates, they are only acquired as rare zoonotic infections in humans. In this communication, we briefly discuss the current status of FV research and review the history of FV epidemiology, as well as the lack of pathogenicity in natural, experimental, and zoonotic infections...|$|R

40|$|<b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (FVs) are ancient retroviruses {{that are}} {{ubiquitous}} in nonhuman primates (NHPs). While FVs share many features with pathogenic retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, FV infections of their primate hosts have no apparent pathological consequences. Paradoxically, FV infections of many cell types in vitro are rapidly cytopathic. Previous work {{has shown that}} low levels of proviral DNA are found in most tissues of naturally infected rhesus macaques, but these proviruses are primarily latent. In contrast, viral RNA, indicative of viral replication, is restricted to tissues of the oral mucosa, where it is abundant. Here, we perform in situ hybridization on tissues from rhesus macaques naturally infected with simian FV (SFV). We show that superficial differentiated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, many of which appear to be shedding from the tissue, are the major cell type in which SFV replicates. Thus, the innocuous nature of SFV infection {{can be explained by}} replication that is limited to differentiated superficial cells that are short-lived and shed into saliva. This finding can also explain the highly efficient transmission of FVs among NHPs. <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (FVs) are complex retroviruses that are widespread in nonhuman primates (NHPs), felines, equines, and bovines.

40|$|<b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (FVs) {{assemble}} using pathways {{distinct from}} those of orthoretroviruses. FV capsid assembly takes place near the host microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Assembled capsids then migrate by an unknown mechanism to the trans-Golgi network to colocalize with the FV glycoprotein, Env. Interaction with Env is required for FV capsid egress from cells; the amino terminus of FV Gag contains a cytoplasmic targeting/retention signal {{that is responsible for}} targeting assembly to the MTOC. A mutant Gag was con-structed by addition of a myristylation (M) signal in an attempt to target assembly to the plasma membrane and potentially overcome the dependence upon Env for budding (S. W. Eastman and M. L. Linial, J. Virol. 75 : 6857 – 6864, 2001). Using this and additional mutants, we now show that assembly is not redirected to the plasma membrane. Addition of an M signal leads to gross morphological defects. The aberrant particles still assemble near the MTOC but do not produce infectious virus. Although extracellular Gag can be detected in a pelletable form in the absence of Env, the mutant particles contain very little genomic RNA and are less dense. Our analyses indicate that the amino terminus of Gag contains an Env interaction domain that is critical for bona fide egress of assembled capsids. <b>Foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (FVs) are ancient viruses (37) that are the only members of the retroviral subfamily Spumaretrovirinae...|$|R

While NWP species in Central and South America are highly diverse, only SFV from captive marmoset, spider monkey, and squirrel monkey have been genetically characterized and the molecular epidemiology of SFV infection in NWPs remains unknown. We tested a large collection of genomic DNA (n = 332) comprising 14 genera of NWP species for the presence of SFV polymerase (pol) sequences using generic PCR primers. Further molecular characterization of positive samples was carried out by LTR-gag and larger pol sequence analysis. We identified novel SFVs infecting nine NWP genera. Prevalence rates varied between 14 – 30 % in different species for which at least 10 specimens were tested. High SFV genetic diversity among NWP up to 50 % in LTR-gag and 40 % in pol was revealed by intragenus and intrafamilial comparisons. Two different SFV strains infecting two captive yellow-breasted capuchins did not group in species-specific lineages but rather clustered with SFVs from marmoset and spider monkeys, indicating independent cross-species transmission events. We describe the first SFV epidemiology study of NWP, and the first evidence of SFV infection in wild NWPs.

40|$|The hematopoeitic {{stem cell}} {{is a prime}} target for gene therapy {{in the attempt to}} correct a number of single gene {{inherited}} genetic defects that affect the immune system. In persons affected by leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD- 1) the gene for the Beta- 2 subunit of the integrin molecule is mutated. This autosomal recessive gene defect yields a phenotype with little or no beta- 2 integrin expression on leukocytes. Beta- 2 integrin expression is essential for leukocytes to travel from the blood to the tissues to fight infection. Persons with this disease have lowered leukocyte counts in the tissues and as a result are beset with recurrent infections which often cause death within the first year of life. As an alternative to using sibling bone marrow transplants, a treatment using retroviral vectors in autologous gene therapy is being studied to correct the disease. Problems surrounding retroviral vectors include 1) a dependence on cell division for integration, 2) short term transgene expression, 3) insertional mutagenesis and 4) the potential of becoming replication competent.

40|$|Simian <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (SFVs) {{are highly}} {{prevalent}} {{in a variety}} of nonhuman primate species ranging from prosimians to apes. SFVs possess a broad host range, and human infections can occur by cross-species transfer (W. Heneine et al., Nat. Med. 4 : 403 – 407, 1998). Retrovirus screening of potential sources of infection, such as laboratory research animals and simian-derived biological products, could minimize human exposure to SFVs by reducing the risk of potential retrovirus infection in humans. We describe a variety of sensitive assays for SFV isolation and detection which were developed with a prototype strain of SFV serotype 2. The Mus dunni cell line (M. R. Lander and S. K. Chattopadhyay, J. Virol. 52 : 695 – 698, 1984) was found to be highly sensitive for SFV production on the basis of various general and specific retrovirus detection assays such as reverse transcriptase assay, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence assay, and Western blotting.

In this study, we con-ducted experimental infections of natural (cattle) and heterologous (sheep) hosts with the BFV 100 isolate andmonitored infec-tion patterns in both hosts during the early phase postinoculation as well as after long-term infection. Four calves and six sheep inoculated with BFV 100 showed no signs of pathology but developed persistent infection, as confirmed by virus rescue, consistent detection of BFV-specific antibodies, and presence of viral DNA. In both hosts, antibodies against BFV Gag and Bet appeared early after infection and persisted at high and stable levels while seroreactivity toward Env was consistently detectable only in BFV-infected sheep. Interestingly, the BFV proviral DNA load was highest in lung, spleen, and liver andmoderate in leukocytes, while salivary glands contained either low or undetectable DNA loads in calves or sheep, respectively. Additionally, comparison of partial BFV sequences from inoculum and infected animals demonstrated very limited changes after long-term infection in the heterologous host, clearly less than those found in BFV field isolates. The persistence of BFV infection in both hosts suggests full replication competence of the BFV 100 isolate with no requirement of genetic adaptation for productive replication in the au-thentic and even in a heterologous host.
