25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nately {{actually}} {{sees his}} friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents {{would not be}} impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.|$|E
25|$|One <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{given the}} {{association}} of the flag with Chinese nationalism in opposition to Taiwan independence, the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the People's Republic of China. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps {{to do so would}} bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.|$|E
25|$|Both tickets offer All-Star Game goers {{unmatched}} {{vantage points}} in Busch Stadium at prices that are significantly discounted {{from the market}} value of a professional game. The opportunity to get an autograph from a Hall of Famer is a complimentary bonus. The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lou Brock was asked to participate in the event long before the connection was made between the Lewis & Clark Baseball League and the St. Louis great's full name: Louis Clark Brock.|$|E
25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by {{the time}} the story was published, the Bikini Club had been gone for over a year.|$|R
50|$|A tragic <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Saqr bin Sultan - the {{man whose}} memory the {{demolition}} of the fort was intended to erase - was to return to Sharjah in 1972 in an abortive coup attempt in which Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad was killed.|$|R
50|$|A Rhetoric of <b>Irony</b> <b>is</b> a {{book about}} irony by American {{literary}} critic Wayne Booth. Booth argues {{that in addition to}} forms of literary <b>irony,</b> there <b>are</b> <b>ironies</b> <b>that</b> lack a stable referent.|$|R
500|$|Cobain's lyrics {{address the}} {{people outside the}} {{underground}} music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows {{after the release of}} the group's debut album Bleach. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad wrote, [...] "But remarkably, [...] translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed." [...] Regarding the song's chorus, Azerrad commented, [...] "The brilliant <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it." [...] In his biography of Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, Charles R. Cross asserted that the song was a [...] "thinly disguised portrait" [...] of Cobain's friend Dylan Carlson.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but the <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education {{is more of a}} struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|Folie à deux {{is a rare}} {{psychiatric}} syndrome {{in which}} symptoms of a delusional belief are transmitted from one individual to another. The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie à trois, folie à quatre, folie en famille or even folie à plusieurs ("madness of many"). Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as dependency psychotic disorder or induced delusional disorder, although the research literature largely uses the original name. The disorder was first conceptualized in 19th century French psychiatry. In keeping with the record's socially aware nature, the band felt that the term was relevant to the candidates in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Stump further clarified the title's meaning: [...] "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people will probably mistake the title as something about romantic relationships in some way. And it's our only record where that theme is not touched upon." ...|$|E
25|$|An <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 72 {{years earlier}} the Nez Perce had greeted in {{friendship}} the half-starved Lewis and Clark Expedition on Weippe Prairie. Clark, it was reputed, {{had a son}} with a Nez Perce wife and that son, now an elderly man, was with Joseph.|$|R
50|$|In George Orwell's novel 1984, the Ministry of Truth has {{an entire}} {{department}} devoted to altering past editions of {{newspapers in the}} belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history. One of the novel's greatest <b>ironies</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies.|$|R
5000|$|Townshend {{stated in}} an {{interview}} <b>that</b> Baba O'Riley' <b>is</b> about the absolute desolation of teenagers at Woodstock, where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some listeners took the song to be a teenage celebration: 'Teenage Wasteland, yes! We're all wasted! ...|$|R
500|$|The {{cover was}} controversial; {{editions of the}} album sold at Circuit City came housed in a {{cardboard}} sleeve featuring an alternate cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point." [...] In 2008, Gigwise ranked it at number ten on their list of [...] "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time".|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{however, the}} Anti-Sec {{community}} published {{use of the}} term to refer to people who work in the security industry by day, but engage in black hat activities by night. The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for black hats, this interpretation was seen as a derogatory term; whereas amongst white hats it <b>was</b> a term <b>that</b> lent a sense of popular notoriety.|$|R
25|$|The governor's {{race that}} year between Treen and Edwin Washington Edwards, making his third-term comeback, had been {{decided in the}} jungle primary in favor of Edwards by a wide margin. The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Fitzmorris had won twice as {{lieutenant}} governor with Edwards {{at the top of}} the ballot. This time Edwards supported Freeman. It was a political oddity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> devastating to Fitzmorris. He never politically recovered from the defeat.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} {{there had been}} a spate of {{criticism}} of the South African Judiciary by Zuma supporters, amongst whom were some prominent legal minds, such as Paul Ngobeni. In <b>that</b> context, the <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> the third time the South African Judiciary had found in his favour, including Zuma's acquittal of the rape charge brought against him. The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal the decision.|$|R
2500|$|According to Zbigniew Brzezinski [...] "the overt and {{increasingly}} arbitrary political manipulation of Russia's political process {{culminated in the}} elections to Duma in late 2007 that were {{not much more than}} a state controlled public plebiscite. The ultimate <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> at the time, Putin could in all probability prevailed even in a truly contested electoral process" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} told by [...] "Thérèse" [...] in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally {{revealed}} that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her sister submitted to {{a brief period of}} vice and found herself a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Within London, {{the desire}} for banks to be there put {{pressure}} on the City of London's ability to accommodate them. [...] In the mid-1980s a crisis point was reached and, although the City was able to expand its stock of modern office space, this did not happen before Canary Wharf had been set up as a competitor. [...] The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Canary Wharf was built in the London Docklands that had, until 1970, been among the largest docks in the world. All manner of goods had been shipped from the factories of east London to the world; between 1961 and 1993 manufacturing employment in London fell from 1.6million to 328,000.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> McNaughton's {{scheme for}} staving off {{revolution}} had {{the seeds of}} revolution inherent in it. Within two years the camps <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> greeted with such applause would be known throughout the country as slave camps. The [...] "volunteer inmates" [...] were not allowed newspapers, magazines or radios. Any man who left a camp, even for a visit to his family, was subsequently refused re-entry and the [...] "dole" [...] was denied to him.|$|R
5000|$|... "London {{streets are}} paved with gold" [...] <b>is</b> a saying <b>that</b> {{came from the}} 19th century story of Dick Whittington and his cat, loosely based on the 14th century Lord Mayor of London, Richard Whittington. The saying, which expresses {{the idea of a}} [...] "land of opportunity", is partly ironic, since Dick Whittington found when he went to London <b>that</b> the streets <b>were</b> in fact grimy and poverty stricken. The second <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> with persistence, belief, and luck, Whittington was able to become successful.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this {{theological}} flowering, [...] "for the first time in well over a century, the church of Rome would {{be in a position to}} debate theological issues with Byzantium from a position of equality in both intellectual substance and rhetorical form". However, [...] "the <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Rome would experience its revitalization not by drawing upon its own pitiable resources, but rather through the collaboration of a Greco-Palestinian pope and a Constantinopolitan monk employing a style of theological discource whose tradition was purely Eastern".|$|R
2500|$|... "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{was during}} the time of {{publication}} that my father's relationship with Judah was most strained, and the point of conflict was over the content of the book. Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall. Then he and my father retired to another room to talk the issue out. I could tell from the grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences".|$|E
2500|$|The ill-feeling {{seems to}} have spread into the next {{generation}} for James records that John has cut 'march' trees down {{in the past and}} has thrown thorns and brambles from the march into the High Chapeltoun's hayfields. The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> John of Laigh Chapelton is suing James for cutting down trees from the march dyke and requires money to plant new trees and to compensate for the inconvenience he has been put through. We do not know the outcome, however the action is described as [...] "trifling and frivolous". The clue to the ill-feeling may be in the term 'straightening' which may imply that John's father agreed to a new march which may have resulted in some small loss of his lands.|$|E
2500|$|The Armenians {{have long}} been {{sounding}} the alarm that the Azerbaijanis intend to eliminate all evidence of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan and to this end have been carrying out massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces. [...] "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this destruction has taken place not {{during a time of}} war but at a time of peace," [...] Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told The Times. Azerbaijan has consistently denied these accusations. For example, according to the Azerbaijani ambassador to the US, Hafiz Pashayev, the videos and photographs [...] "show some unknown people destroying mid-size stones", and [...] "it is not clear of what nationality those people are", and the reports are Armenian propaganda designed to divert attention from what he claimed was a [...] "state policy (by Armenia) to destroy the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories".|$|E
50|$|This {{inductive}} {{system was}} prone to frequent damage to the underground feeder cables, overhead cables, and the loops themselves. Later the MW transmitter {{was replaced by a}} freely radiating, low-power FM transmitter. But the last time I tuned in, an audio signal ground had dropped off somewhere, so you could only hear the difference between the left and right channel (i.e. the stereo bit, on the music). The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the presenter <b>was</b> in mono, and was therefore completely inaudible on the broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Steve Popovich {{reportedly}} {{listened to}} the intro to the song {{and it became a}} key factor of his accepting Bat Out of Hell for Cleveland International Records. The ultimate <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Meat Loaf, Steinman, and the band tried for a year or so to get the record label with their music, and how they allegedly did so was a 45-second recording with no singing at all. The song has a reminiscently Motown feel to it, particularly in its echoed vocals, drums and drum breakdown.|$|R
5000|$|His later films {{included}} First to Fight (1967) and Number One (1969), opposite Charlton Heston. In Robert Altman's 1970 film M*A*S*H {{he had a}} cameo as {{a disgruntled}} staff sergeant assigned to driving Hawkeye and Trapper John around in Japan. (His only two lines of dialogue is a repeated exasperation, [...] "Goddamn army!" [...] and [...] "Goddamn army jeep!" [...] One point of <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bobby also performed in the Armed Forces re-enlistment commercials broadcast on Armed Forces Radio and Television in Vietnam during that war.) ...|$|R
2500|$|One year later, Out of Here {{was shown}} at Galerie Lelong in New York City. This second {{iteration}} contained {{an excerpt from}} a different speech by the President, and mentioned {{the end of the}} war and the gradual withdrawal of troops. Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, “It made the work more up to date…but the <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this project didn’t have to change much.” [...] Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. “The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York’s character and the [...] shows gave Out of Here a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.” Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, the larger picture of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war’s repercussions.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{official}} ParnassusFilm Twitter channel launched on 30 March 2009, post-production was finished on 31 March. After the production had finally come to a successful closure, Gilliam felt that [...] " [...] didn't make this film. Forces from above and below made it. It made itself. I don't worry anymore. It's got its own relentless momentum. It just needed some human sacrifice." [...] "It's made itself – I was just one pair of hands {{and there were many}} hands." [...] "Don't get me into my mystical mode ... but the film made itself and it was co-directed by Heath Ledger!" [...] "The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the choices that were forced upon us improved the movie, so it was as if Heath co-directed the movie, even co-wrote it." [...] According to Gilliam, actor Colin Farrell also went on record for saying that he hadn't been simply playing the character of Tony, but that he was rather feeling like [...] "channeling Heath".|$|E
2500|$|Reforms continued, and in {{the early}} 2000s {{students}} and faculty at the Pace Law School's Securities Arbitration Clinic wrote about the long-term effects. In 2003, Professor Barbara Black reviewed cases and found that increasingly it was the brokerage firms trying to use the courts to break arbitration clauses. The clinic's associate director, Jill Gross, reviewed the reforms 20 years after the case and concluded that the process was fairer to investors. While she noted some unresolved issues, such as the [...] "paradox" [...] created by McMahon under which investors {{would have a hard time}} proving that securities arbitration procedures did not meet FAA standards if those same standards had been approved by the SEC, she noted that the McMahons would probably turn to arbitration anyway were their case heard today since changes to the 1934 Act had shortened the statute of limitations and made it harder to prove scienter. [...] "Instead, most customer arbitrations today are predicated on state securities acts and common law claims such as breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation and fraud, and draw heavily on principles of equity" [...] she wrote. [...] "The ultimate <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> even though the Supreme Court opened the door to securities arbitration, even without the McMahon decision, today’s customers would continue to pursue their claims in arbitration." ...|$|E
30|$|The day {{cancellation}} rate of 5.44 % in {{this study}} is similar to the national mean reported 7  years ago by the Audit Commission [1] but the <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> two of the four cancellations were due to theatre overrunning. Cancelled cases have financial implications as national contracts require trusts to rebook cancelled patients within 28  days, thus creating extra pressure on existing scheduled lists. It is equally important to recognize socioeconomic impact on patients who have undoubtedly arranged their work and family commitment around operation dates [11].|$|R
50|$|The {{story was}} {{told of the}} General sucking snake venom from James Spratt, son of Kanawha Spartt, that saved James' life. The General gave the Spratts the land on the {{reservation}}. (This is just one version of who gave the land on the reservation to the Spratts.) General New River even borrowed Thomas Spartt's horse at one time. The General rode the horse hard and Spratt beat him for this infraction. The <b>irony</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> later Spratt killed the same horse, doing exactly what he had beaten General New River for doing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981 Foster Hirsch {{carried on}} a trend of more {{positive}} reviews, calling Bigelow's search for his own killer noir irony at its blackest. He wrote, [...] "One of the film's many <b>ironies</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his last desperate search involves him in his life more forcefully than he has ever been before... Tracking down his killer just before he dies [...] - [...] discovering {{the reason for his}} death [...] - [...] {{turns out to be the}} triumph of his life." [...] Critic A. K. Rode notes Rudolph Maté's technical background, writing: ...|$|R
