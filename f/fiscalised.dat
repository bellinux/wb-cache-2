40|$|The present article synthesizes recent French {{literature}} on the diocese’s space {{between the end of}} Antiquity to the 13 th century. Contrary to traditional historiography, which rarely poses questions on spatial concepts and tends to privilege the thesis of a substantial continuity of ancient legacies, these researches underscore the transformation of the dominium exercised by the bishops and the chapter over the diocese between the 10 th and the 13 th century. These studies also highlight the passage from a “seigneurial” or “feudal” model based on the control of privileged enclaves, the mobilization of dependent resources and symbolical exchanges, to a “governmental” model, which rested on a territorialized jurisdiction, on administrative practices and on <b>fiscalised</b> exchanges. At the heart of such a transformation lay a process of relative depersonalization of the episcopal dominium triggered by the bureaucratization of the diocese’s management; a fact which was most notably visible in the delegation of such functions to canons or specialised officers, in the creation of an administrative network for the management of space and in the growing tendency to resort to written practices. In such a way, the ecclesiastical institution paved the way to the State...|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the efficiency of}} <b>Fiscalised</b> Electronic Devices in improving revenue collection in selected companies in Harare using {{the case of the}} Fiscal Electronic Tax Registers. The study specifically seeks to determine whether efficient Fiscal Electronic Tax Registers increase the revenue base due to tax compliance. The basis of the study lies on the need to raise awareness on the efficiency and importance of the ETRs in improving tax revenue and tax compliance. The research combines desk and field research. Field research entailed questionnaires and interviews with key informants. Desk research entailed review of concepts, theories and experiences related to the topic. The salient findings of this research are that, efficient Fiscal Electronic Tax Registers increase the revenue base due to tax compliance. While there has been a remarkable improvement in the tax collection system, there is not much improvement on the Value Added Tax (VAT) collections since the adoption of FEDs. FETRs have only improved tax compliance in the companies that are using them. The factors that negatively affect tax compliance are resistant to change, reluctance by tax payers to embrace fiscalisation, lack of knowledge, increased administration costs and lack of capacity as well as the influx of informal traders who do not offer receipts. Fiscalisation improves internal accountability, management and control of business by recording and storing all sales without manipulation. This is evidenced by accurate caption of data and shorter audit periods by the tax collectors among others. Notwithstanding this, fiscalisation has its own challenges such as few suppliers of the devices, unrealistic deadlines, and higher penalties and also the system was not user-friendly and compatible with other devices. This is evidenced by the slow uptake of the devices due to lack of capacity and failure to get tax clearances because they had not <b>fiscalised.</b> Against this backdrop, the study recommends that ZIMRA carry out an impact assessment on the fiscalisation project {{to determine the extent of}} it success through monitoring and evaluation. There is need to educate the nation on the use of FETRs and the need to comply, even in rural remote areas. The government should revise the turn-over downwards to accommodate more tax payers. There is need to develop systems that are compatible and can be integrated with the computers in business premises. The informal sector should also be brought into the tax net to increase competition. The government should come up with a more user-friendly system that is easy to use linked to the internet for faster and easy access by ZIMRA...|$|E
40|$|To ensure some minimal {{standard}} for traffic system operation and safety, {{a system of}} traffic laws and regulations is necessary. Enforcement of these traffic laws is believed to influence driving behaviour through a mechanism of deterrence: the threat of legal punishment should convince road users to refrain from committing violations, which would result in an improvement of traffic safety. Traditionally, the responsibility and competence for the enforcement of traffic laws {{is in the hands}} of the police. In the past decades, vehicle mobility has experienced an enormous growth, leading to a proportional increase in the number of cars on the road and associated traffic offences, and a more complex traffic system in general. As a consequence, the police role in traffic has become more extensive and complex. However, police capacity has not increased proportionally. In most European countries it is commonly agreed upon that police resources are scarce. Moreover, in general, traffic enforcement activities do not have the highest priority or status in police forces that have a general policing task. Therefore, other measures are implemented and explored that contribute to safe behaviour on the roads and that lessen the burden of traffic enforcement placed on the police. With this situation on the background, in several European countries a tendency has arisen to explore the possibility of transferring certain traffic law enforcement tasks to non-police organisations. Without attempting to be exhaustive, in the current study a number of different situations in Europe has been reviewed in which non-police based organisations are taking part in the total traffic enforcement system or in which such systems are experimented with. Examples of these non-police enforcement tasks were speed enforcement by local authorities (Germany), driver improvement measures conducted by specialised governmental authorities (France), periodical vehicle inspections by private companies (Finland) and fiscal and administrative enforcement of parking by local authorities (the Netherlands). It was attempted to broadly identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of these systems. The situations reviewed in Finland and France are relatively the least controversial since they involve situations where the role of police traditionally has been small or non-existent. Up until the end of 1992, periodical vehicle inspections in Finland were the exclusive responsibility of a government bureau, the Central Motor Vehicle Register. From the beginning of 1993 the Central Motor Vehicle Register ceased to operate as a government bureau, and its status was changed to that of a state-owned commercial enterprise. In 1996 it was incorporated as a joint stock company, in which case there may be owners other than the state. Privatization of the vehicle inspection system was carried out also in other ways. Thus, the reviewed changes to traditional vehicle inspection in Finland mainly involve a transfer of government tasks to commercially operated institutions. As the results of an evaluation study show, in this case the transfer may have positive effects on public acceptance, since some groups of drivers even seem to think they may personally profit from the choice between government controlled and commercially operated institutions. In France, a licence demerit point system has been introduced in 1992 to drive back recidivism rates in traffic violations. Associated with this, driver improvement courses are conducted by which convicted drivers can recover their lost licence points. State authorities are responsible for the accreditation of course centres and their staff. This traffic management system can be regarded as an important support system for the police in reducing the number of traffic offences on the road. The French example presents the substitution of traditional punishment by fine or imprisonment by the alternative of participating in a driver improvement course. In both cases the options that are open to the driver are enlarged and the role of the (traffic) police is only marginally affected or is not at issue at all. The Dutch and German examples bring us closer to the heart of the controversy surrounding non-police based enforcement. They pertain directly to the transfer of important responsibilities of the (traffic) police to other institutions. In some European countries the legal basis for the operation of governmental bodies as enforcement authorities is already existing. It was found that in the majority of German federal states, local authorities have the legal competence to operate as traffic enforcement authorities. Although this type of enforcement appears not to be widespread yet, it is expected that in the future more municipalities will exercise their role as an enforcement authority. The main advantage of this type of enforcement seems to be the enormous increase in enforcement capacity that can be achieved. The main threats that were identified for this type of enforcement are: (i) municipalities making traffic safety objectives subordinate to the financial gain that can be generated by enforcement efforts; (ii) co-ordination problems associated with different authorities carrying out the same enforcement tasks; and (iii) problems related to public acceptance. However, (the limited) research results in Germany demonstrated that the selection of enforcement sites in municipalities conducting enforcement is mainly based on traffic safety aspects. Most local authorities report a close co-operation with the police concerning enforcement time and location as well as in the prosecution of offenders. Overall the municipalities report a good acceptance of their enforcement activities by road users. Finally, most of them report speed and accident reductions as a result of the speed enforcement. Similar considerations apply to the introduction of administrative and fiscal parking enforcement in the Netherlands. To increase police capacity and relieve the workload in courts at the same time, in the nineties traffic law enforcement in the Netherlands increasingly made use of detection and prosecution of violations on the basis of administrative law. The system allows large-scale processing of cases due to its simplified procedure. It is no longer necessary to establish the identity of the offender, as the owner of the vehicle is assumed culpable. In financial terms, the system is very profitable to the state. The temptation, perhaps even policy, consequently may be to maximise profits rather than the objectives of traffic safety. To further relieve the police from traffic related enforcement tasks, parking violations in a growing number of municipalities in the Netherlands can now be processed under fiscal law. <b>Fiscalising</b> parking violations (non-payment of parking) enables authorities other than police - i. e. local ‘tax’ authorities - to carry out enforcement tasks. The following threats or possible negative consequences of these ‘innovations in enforcement’ were identified: (i) Instead of regulating quality of life and accessibility of cities, taxes and fees might very well be used to regulate the city’s budget deficit; and (ii) Surveillance may be concentrated on violations that are simple to register and in areas where registration is straightforward. Enforcement of offences that do not require a direct contact between the enforcement authority and the driver, are most eligible for a transfer to non-police bodies. However, a total loss of contact between drivers and the police (or other appropriate enforcement agency could lead to a decrease the acceptance of the traffic policing.
