5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E
5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> <b>this</b> purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E

He has stated that continuing use of 2D computer graphics has been integral to Pokémon's success.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{attempted}} to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which {{he learned from}} Jewish exegesis and Stoicism. Philo {{attempted to}} make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious truths. These truths he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy {{was used as an}} aid to truth, and a means of arriving at <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> <b>this</b> end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity and indestructibility of the world.|$|E

25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (though it might contain a carry digit under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a carry digit (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), add <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> product. If the resulting sum is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E
25|$|Joint General Assembly: The Islamic Commission for Economic, Cultural and Social Affairs {{consisting}} of {{all member states}} of the OIC acts as the Joint General Assembly of the subsidiary organs including IUT. This assembly acts as the General Assembly of the university. It determines general policy and provides general guidance. It examines {{the activities of the}} university and submits recommendations to the ICFM. Internal rules and regulations which govern the internal activities are shaped through the decisions of this assembly. It elects the members of the governing body and examines the whole budget for a year. The Finance Control Organ of the university audits the financial possessions of the university and submits <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> assembly. Then it is submitted to the ICFM from here.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit {{of the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a carry digit, add <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the carry digit to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus carry digit, if there is one) is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E

25|$|This stage {{takes place}} after the auditions have been completed, and is also {{referred}} to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they had progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.|$|E
25|$|Wandering {{alone in}} the forest, the empress (she is given no name in this romance) lies tired and {{exhausted}} at a spring one evening and falls asleep. In the morning, as the dawn chorus begins, an ape suddenly emerges from the forest and steals away one of her babies. Then a lioness appears and takes away the other in its mouth. The woman is distraught! She assumes that she is being punished for her sins and undertakes to journey to the Holy Land, so she travels to the Aegean Sea and takes a ship bound for Jerusalem. On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin – we already know – had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child and took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows. They all arrive in Jerusalem where the King recognises the lady for who she is, names her little boy Octavian and allows her to stay, with her child and her lioness, in wealth and comfort.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{recording}} process, Dean had been listening to country, drawing inspiration from 1960s guitarists like Jimmy Bryant, Speedy West, Hank Garland, Pete Drake, Hank Snow and Aerosmith's Brad Whitford. Songs like [...] "Hickory Dichotomy" [...] gave Weiland and Kretz a [...] "Down South" [...] and [...] "swampy kind of feeling". Although it was recorded in standard tuning, [...] "Hickory Dichotomy" [...] features a slide guitar solo performed in open G. Both [...] "Cinnamon" [...] and [...] "Maver" [...] were recorded with a Telecaster set up for Nashville tuning, and Dean described [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] as having a [...] "down-home country kind of feel", but noted Weiland's influence on the song: [...] "That title takes <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> whole other plateau." ...|$|E
