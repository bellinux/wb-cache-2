5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

40|$|Bomb blast cause injury {{on large}} groups of people by {{multiple}} mechanisms. Bomb blast injuries differ from the conventional description of trauma complexity. Primary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by blast wave and over pressure. Secondary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by flyin g debris and cause shrapnel wounds. Tertiary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by blast wind due to forceful impact and quaternary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by other vectors like heat, radiation etc. Combined injuries, especially blast and burn injury or blast and crush injur y, are common during an explosive event.

Diagnosis of this <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> difficult with angiography, but on duplex ultrasonography, the <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> more clearly seen.

5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries.

40|$|Spinal cord <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} devastating of all trauma-related injuries. Penetrating {{cervical}} spinal cord <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> seen rarely. Due to the damage to neural structures, these <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> associated with significant morbidity. The majority of penetrating <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by gunshot wounds. Stabbing injuries caused by knives, screwdrivers, glass fragments and nails are much less common. The primary concern in managing penetrating neck <b>injuries</b> <b>is</b> control of bleeding and airway management. In this case report we described an unusual case of accidental nail injury occuring in a man who sustained a penetrating neck injury with a nail lodged between the os occipitale and the first cervical vertebra which caused incomplete spinal injury...|$|R
