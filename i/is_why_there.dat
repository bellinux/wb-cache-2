5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

25|$|Other {{numerical}} abnormalities discovered include {{sex chromosome}} abnormalities. A female {{with only one}} Xchromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas an additional Xchromosome in a male, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has Klinefelter Syndrome. Many other sex chromosome combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and XXXX. The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the Xchromosome are inactivated, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> is a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra Xchromosomes.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it is important to know that these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{population}} decline beginning around the 6th century lends some {{support to the}} internal unrest hypothesis. The decline of Teotihuacan has been correlated to lengthy droughts related to the climate changes of 535–536. This theory of ecological decline is supported by archaeological remains that show {{a rise in the}} percentage of juvenile skeletons with evidence of malnutrition during the 6th century. Which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> is different evidence that helps indicate that famine is most likely one of the more possible reasons for the decline of Teotihuacan. The majority of their food came from agriculture, they grew things such as maize, bean, amaranth, green tomatoes, and pumpkin. But their harvest was not nearly sufficient enough to feed a population as big as it is believed lived in Teotihuacan. This finding does not conflict with either of the above theories, since both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine. Other nearby centers such as Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla competed to fill the power void left by Teotihuacan's decline. They may have aligned themselves against Teotihuacan to reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites emulate Teotihuacan forms, but also demonstrate an eclectic mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.|$|E

500|$|After {{working with}} the cover for the album, {{provisionally}} titled Runaway Train, Levy went on vacation and travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy {{came up with the}} idea [...] "to do it all graphic black on black" [...] and sketched what would become the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and requested he do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard [...] "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it curious that his artwork fit the title track [...] "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with Back in Black – [...] "Black" [...] in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was [...] "like a time travel, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>there</b> are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single [...] "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy [...] "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus with his fist in the air resembling the statue on Stiff Upper Lip, because Levy [...] "just thought it was great as a continuing icon."
