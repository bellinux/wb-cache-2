25|$|AVPA {{is unique}} for being {{subdivided}} into three divisions: Visual, {{which focuses on}} combining skill and passion into one cohesive movement; Music, where there are mandatory <b>keyboarding</b> and digital music classes, {{as well as a}} focused instrument; and Theatre, which stages all plays at the school and has resources similar to and sometimes better than Broadway plays. Depending on their focus, students in AVPA take classes in drawing, painting, printing, acting, and stagecraft, and music or music theory.|$|E
25|$|The Austine School {{was led by}} {{principal}} Anne Potter {{and offered}} residential and day student programs. The elementary school program used {{a combination of the}} Montessori Method, the State of Vermont Framework of Standards and Learning Opportunities and the VCDHH curriculum to develop within students the foundation of knowledge, communication proficiency, critical thinking and conflict resolution skill, and a level of maturity to transition into middle school and beyond. The middle and high school continued to focus on the whole student and adhere to curricula based on VFSLO. Core classes were English, Reading, Math, Science, Social Studies, Art, Health, <b>Keyboarding</b> and Physical Education. Electives were provided.|$|E
25|$|Assistive {{technology}} {{in this area}} is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while <b>keyboarding,</b> word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970s word {{processing}} concept did not refer merely to equipment, but, explicitly, {{to the use}} of equipment for [...] "breaking down secretarial labor into distinct components, with some staff members handling typing exclusively while others supply administrative support. A typical operation would leave most executives without private secretaries. Instead one secretary would perform various administrative tasks for three or more secretaries." [...] A 1971 article said that [...] "Some [...] see W/P as a career ladder into management; others see it as a dead-end into the automated ghetto; others predict it will lead straight to the picket line." [...] The National Secretaries Association, which defined secretaries as people who [...] "can assume responsibility without direct supervision," [...] feared that W/P would transform secretaries into [...] "space-age typing pools." [...] The article considered only the organizational changes resulting from secretaries operating word processors rather than typewriters; the possibility that word processors might result in managers creating documents without the intervention of secretaries was not considerednot surprising in an era when few managers, but most secretaries, possessed <b>keyboarding</b> skills.|$|E

40|$|A <b>keyboard</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} input device for a computer. It is used with various types and sizes of computer. But the same standard <b>keyboard</b> will not work efficiently with different types of computers at different environments. There is a need to develop special <b>keyboards</b> to meet special requirements. This article illustrates 10 inventions on special types of <b>keyboards.</b> The special <b>keyboard</b> are used in special computers or computers used for special purposes. A special <b>keyboard</b> is to be understood as a <b>keyboard</b> having features beyond a normal <b>keyboard.</b> The example of special <b>keyboards</b> are, a children's <b>keyboard</b> which may be colorful and attractive, a <b>keyboard</b> in public place need to be more robust, the <b>keyboard</b> in a palmtop may have less number of keys, the <b>keyboard</b> for a game station may have special attachments, a multimedia <b>keyboard</b> may have CD ROM and speakers, a wireless <b>keyboard</b> may have remote control features, a touch sensitive <b>keyboard</b> may have sensors on the keys and so on.

50|$|Although the PC/XT and AT {{used the}} same style of <b>keyboard</b> connector, the {{low-level}} protocol for reading the <b>keyboard</b> was different between these two series. The AT <b>keyboard</b> uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the <b>keyboard.</b> An AT <b>keyboard</b> {{could not be used}} in an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party <b>keyboard</b> manufacturers provided a switch on some of their <b>keyboards</b> to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R
