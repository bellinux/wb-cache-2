5|$|Fame {{does not}} last, however. Nestor {{is not as}} ambitious as his brother and desires {{nothing more than to}} own his own small club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true <b>feelings,</b> <b>that</b> a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Prost had {{a meeting}} with the head of Honda's R {{department}} and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E
50|$|Sensations {{related to}} the phantom limb's posture, length and volume e.g. <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the phantom limb is {{behaving}} just like a normal limb like sitting with the knee bent or <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the phantom limb is as heavy as the other limb. Sometimes, an amputee will experience a sensation called telescoping. This is the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the phantom limb is gradually shortening over time.|$|R
5000|$|McMillan & Chavis (1986) define {{sense of}} {{community}} as [...] "a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> members have of belonging, a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> members matter {{to one another and}} to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their commitment to be together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gingerbread," [...] faltered Bobby, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> a sin {{had been}} committed, though, probably, <b>feeling</b> also <b>that</b> he himself could hardly as yet be {{accounted}} as deeply guilty.|$|R
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> he had, {{and those that}} he saw were common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on {{questioning}} what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E

6000|$|Jessie nodded. [...] "It's romantic, {{and though}} {{you must be}} glad it's over, {{there must be some}} {{satisfaction}} in <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> you owe the change to your own efforts. Doesn't it give you a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> in some degree you're master of your fate? I fancy I should like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was half}} asleep as he descended the companion-ladder. A strange and sad yet dreamy <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} he did was [...] "for the last time," [...] weighed heavily on his spirit, but this was somehow relieved {{by the knowledge that}} he was now at last about to rest! There was delight in that simple thought, though there mingled with it a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the rest would terminate in death; he lay down to sleep with a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he lay down to die, and a half-formed prayer escaped his lips as his wearied head fell upon the pillow.|$|R
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
25|$|Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini {{introduced}} the related term heteronegativism {{to refer to}} the considerable range of negative <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> some gay individuals may hold and express toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to heterophobia because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.|$|E
50|$|Sensations of {{movement}} (e.g. <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the phantom foot is moving).|$|R
60|$|Just at midnight, {{a horrible}} <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{was new and}} strange to him came over Stan--a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he could not put into words even to himself, but which almost forced him {{to give up the}} battle and take the {{shortest}} road home again. He half turned; then he remembered the children, and turned back.|$|R
2500|$|A {{sore throat}} or <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} {{is stuck in}} the throat ...|$|R
25|$|A {{lot of the}} {{physical}} side of it is conveyed in things like, the vampire will touch her forearm or run a hand over skin, and she just flushes all hot and cold. And for girls, that's a shorthand for all the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> they're not {{ready to deal with}} yet.|$|E
25|$|Following Havins's departure, viewers were adamant {{in their}} <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> Babe {{should not have}} been recast; the views ranged from the {{decision}} having been made too soon, to recasting Babe having been unnecessary, to sentiment that only Havins is Babe. Voices expressing their discontent but also relaying their willingness to give the recast a chance were also present.|$|E
25|$|Tanner's {{early and}} {{untimely}} death {{meant that he}} {{would never be able to}} mend the ill <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> resulted from his disputes within his own party, particularly those that arose from his challenge to Shelby Cullom immediately preceding his death. His relationship with Chicago politicians had been consistently antagonistic over the years, and they felt no inclination to remember him kindly.|$|E

25|$|Finally, on February 1, 1854, the {{railroad}} ran a train through Erie without change. But civil disturbances continued for years. Townspeople were assaulted, {{the local newspaper}} was torn down and the ruins burnt, and the Presbyterian church split in two. The matter caused such hard <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> people avoided discussing it for years afterwards {{in order to avoid}} starting arguments.|$|E
25|$|Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson's sweet-natured wife. Though happily married, {{they are}} so anxious to avoid hurting each other's <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> they rarely tell each other what they really think. They have a son, Arthur Carlson, Jr., whom they've sent off to {{military}} school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|E
25|$|In the story, Piro has extreme {{difficulty}} understanding Megatokyos female characters, {{making him}} {{for the most part}} ignorant of the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he has become much more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.|$|E

25|$|Cara Imega: A kind-hearted cross {{who falls}} in love with Jude. She campaigns against the {{discrimination}} towards noughts. Although Jude wants to take her money, he eventually {{falls in love}} with her as well. He becomes so confused about his <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> he follows through with his original plan. He beats her to death and robs all her money. Just before Jasmine detonates the bomb against Jude, the only person he thinks of and sees is Cara, with her hand outstretched.|$|E
25|$|When men {{experience}} vulnerable {{feelings and}} other <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> {{are associated with}} women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), {{the fear of the}} feminine then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, self-reliant, guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear of the feminine can act like a defence, leading to splitting off, repressing, or projecting those feelings.|$|E
25|$|While {{thinking}} of {{an approach that}} would appeal to an audience outside of rock music, and wondering {{about the nature of}} pop music, Yamaguchi thought of the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach as something that transcended time and genre. Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> he had when listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E
