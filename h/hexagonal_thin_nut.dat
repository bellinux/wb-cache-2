50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a <b>thin</b> <b>nut</b> (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|R
30|$|Now {{turning back}} to Figure[*] 1 a, the cyclic load–displacement curves {{obtained}} with the Berkovich indenter for the <b>hexagonal</b> GaSe <b>thin</b> film clearly displays multiple pop-ins in the indentation loading curves. Although at relatively lower applied loadings (< 2 mN) the behaviors are similar to that displayed in Figure[*] 3 a, at higher applied loadings, especially the last segment, it may have arisen from a very different deformation mechanism. In particular, due to the large indentation depth, the pop-out event observed in the last segment of the unloading curve {{might be related to}} the indentation-induced phase transition occurring in the underneath Si substrate [19]. Moreover, as revealed by the SEM photograph shown in Figure[*] 1 b, there are cracks (see the red arrow in the inset of Figure[*] 1 b) and pile-ups along the corners and edges of the residual indented pyramid, respectively. Thus, the cause of the ‘later’ multiple pop-ins may have been complicated by the involvement of the Berkovich indentation-induced cracking {{on the surface of the}} <b>hexagonal</b> GaSe <b>thin</b> films.|$|R

40|$|Fe(II) -based degradative solidification/stabilization (Fe(II) -DS/S) {{technology}} is the modification of conventional solidification/stabilization (S/S). Inorganic pollutants are immobilized by Fe(II) -DS/S while organic pollutants are destroyed. Experimental studies were conducted to identify the active agents for Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) degradation {{as well as the}} conditions that enhance the formation of the active agents in the Fe(II) -DS/S system. PCE was chosen as a model chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon in this study. First, the conditions that lead to maximizing production of the active agents were identified by measuring the ability of various chemical mixtures to degrade PCE. Results showed that Fe(II), Fe(III), Ca, and Cl were the the important elements that affect degradation activity. Elemental compositions of the mixtures and the conditions affecting solid formation might be the important factors in determining how active solids are formed. Second, instrumental analyses (XRD, SEM, SEM-EDS) were used to identify minerals in chemical mixtures that have high activities. Results indicate that active agents for PCE degradation in Portland cement slurries and in cement extracts might be one of several AFm phases. However, systems without cement did not form the same solids as those with cement or cement extract. Ferrous hydroxide was identified as a major solid phase formed in systems without cement. Finally, the effect of using different types of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) on PCE degradation rate during Fe(II) -DS/S was examined and the solids were examined by instrumental analyses (XRD, SEM, SEM-EDS). Four different OPC (Txi, Lehigh, Quikrete, and Capitol) showed different PCE degradation behaviors. Pseudo first-order kinetics was observed for Capitol and Txi OPC and second-order kinetics was observed for Quikrete. In the case of Lehigh cement, pseudo first-order kinetics was observed in cement slurry and second-order kinetics in cement extract.
