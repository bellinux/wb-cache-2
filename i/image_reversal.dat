Mirror diagonals produce an image in the eyepiece that is correctly oriented vertically, but is reversed left-to-right horizontally.

The major advantage to mirror diagonals is that they cost less to produce to {{a high degree of}} optical accuracy compared to a prism and that they do not introduce any color errors to the image. The major disadvantage of mirror diagonals is that unless the reflective coating is properly applied they can scatter light rendering lower image contrast compared to a 90-degree prism. Also they deteriorate with age as the reflective surface oxidizes. The newer Dielectric mirrors have largely solved the deterioration problem, and if properly made the Dielectric mirrors scatter less light compared to conventional mirrors. With short focal length instruments a mirror diagonal is preferred over a prism.|$|E

Observations: Case report based on one patient. After significant edema of the optic disc for 2 months, the cup depth and cup volume measured by Heidelberg retina tomograph <b>images</b> showed <b>reversal,</b> which lasted for 3 years. The c-RNFL thickness and m-GCC thickness measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography first increased for a week and then continued to decrease until 6 months after operation.

Conclusions and importance: In juvenile onset glaucoma, changes in c-RNFL thickness and m-GCC thickness after operation were not consistent with changes in optic disc cupping. Changes in the thicknesses of the c-RNFL or m-GCC, rather than changes in the optic disc changes, may be good surrogate measures to confirm the effectiveness of glaucoma surgery...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amygdala}} and {{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) are {{often thought of}} as components of a neural circuit that assigns affective significance—or value—to sensory stimuli so as to anticipate future events and adjust behavioral and physiological responses. Much recent work has been aimed at understanding the distinct contributions of the amygdala and OFC to these processes, but a detailed understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying learning about value remains lacking. To gain insight into these processes, we have focused initially on characterizing the neural signals of the primate amygdala, and more recently of the primate OFC, during appetitive and aversive reinforcement learning procedures. We have employed a classical conditioning procedure whereby monkeys form associations between visual stimuli and rewards or aversive stimuli. After learning these initial associations, we reverse the stimulus-reinforcement contingencies, and monkeys learn these new associations. We have discovered that separate populations of neurons in the amygdala represent {{the positive and negative}} value of conditioned visual stimuli. This representation of value updates rapidly upon <b>image</b> value <b>reversal,</b> as fast as monkeys learn, often within a single trial. We suggest that representations of value in the amygdala may change through multiple interrelated mechanisms: some that arise from fairly simple Hebbian processes, and others that may involve gated inputs from other brain areas, such as the OFC...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study of the {{magnetization}} reversal in Permalloy triangular rings using diffracted magneto-optics Kerr effect combined with numerical micromagnetic simulations and in-field magnetic force microscopy. Diffracted loops show a two-step switching process for external fields along or perpendicular to any of the ring edges. The diffracted loops calculated from micromagnetic simulations reproduce the measured ones and show that the switching occurs from one asymmetric onion state to the reversed state, for both directions of the applied field. In both cases a stable intermediate vortex state appears during the switching, accounting for the diffracted loop structures. The stability and the magnetization chirality of the vortex state depend on the direction of the applied field relative to the ring orientation.
