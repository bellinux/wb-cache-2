40|$|Abstract Owing to {{the high}} content of lignocellulose, <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> become a healthy {{material}} for dietary fiber supplementation. In this study, the changes in solubility of the fibers of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> were evaluated. The changes of the pHs and weight losses were studied. Furthermore, variations of the ingredient structures of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> by hydrolysis by hydrochloric acid were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After hydrolysis 30 s, the pHs of all systems increased, while six hours later, the pH of only system with initial pH = 1. 00 decreased. The decline of pH only existed in hydrolysis systems with initial pH = 1. 00, there is no relevant with the quantities of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut.</b> The lower initial pH of hydrolysis system was, the less the intrinsic viscosity of the <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> after hydrolysis was, the small the crystallinity was. After hydrolysis, the microstructure of the <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> become looser, and the secondary structure of the coconut protein became more stable and ordered. The {{results suggest that the}} hydrolysis of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> mainly occurred in the branched chain and the non-crystalline region of lignocellulose, which transforms some insoluble dietary fiber into soluble dietary fiber. This improves the nutritional value of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{formulation}} of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> biscuits by roasting and without roasting was investigated. This research was conducted using randomized block design consisted of two factors and three replications. The first factor is {{the percentage of the}} <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> addition to wheat flour with three levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 %). The second factor is the variation treatment of the desiccated coconut; roasting and without roasting. The result showed that the percentage of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> addition to wheat flour has a significant effect on protein content. The treatment of roasting and without roasting has very significant effect on the peroxide number and significant effect on the moisture content, sensory test (aroma and taste). The interaction factor between the percentage of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> addition to wheat flour and the treatment of roasting and without roasting has a very significant effect on the fat content and has a significant effect on the sensory test (aroma and taste). The best formulation of the <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> biscuits based on the sensory test was obtained from the addition of 75 % of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> without roasting...|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka {{is now in}} a {{position}} to accelerate its economic growth in all sectors. Main agricultural products export sector plays a vital role in this scenario. <b>Desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> {{is one of the most}} important economic products which can contribute considerably for the same. Even though the * government is raising funds in deferent areas for improvement of coconut industry in Sri Lanka so far DC mill owners have not been able to over come their common manufacturing related issues since last decade. The biggest problem at the moment <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> manufacturers face is its cost of production, depleting availability of raw coconut and lack of skill labour. This study mainly focuses to address those issues. But unfortunately unavailability of coconut will not be able to resolve over night. Since that how efficiently use the available resources is vital and discussed herewith. * Ultimate objective is to prepare a generic guideline to <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka which highlighting present inefficiencies and improvement opportunities need to be carried out to overcome their manufacturing and energy utilization related issues to make their business profitable. Using different tools and techniques in process improvement and waste reduction in • manufacturing processes is vital in the world. "Cleaner production" is one of such tool can be applied in any area such as manufacturing, service providing etc mainly highlighting environmental concerns and waste elimination. Therefore "Cleaner Production" methodology has been used for evaluation of <b>desiccated</b> <b>coconut</b> manufacturing process and identifies the process inefficiencies. For investigation of DC manufacturing process, Katana DC mill is selected as a modernized and medium scale DC plant which represents the majority of the desiccated mills in Sri Lanka. At the moment we have only 53 DC mills and 90 % of those are in medium scale. Unless few machineries or equipment used, the production process and the technology available is identical in all DC mills in Sri Lanka. Cleaner production assessment tools and techniques have been used for execution of the investigation of DC production process...|$|R
