5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by <b>differential</b> <b>erosion</b> of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape.

The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water, becoming the lakes of today.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while <b>differential</b> <b>erosion</b> and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E

25|$|Excellent {{exposures}} of {{the angular}} unconformity {{at the top}} of the Dox Formation and the base of the Tapeats Sandstone can be seen at Mile 71.0 where Tapeats Sandstone rests on the eroded surface of the Dox Formation, and a basalt sill. In these exposures, Dox red beds and a dark gray basaltic sill, dip 8 to 10 degrees to the east. They are covered by nearly horizontal Tapeats Sandstone. The surface of this angular unconformity is quite irregular as <b>differential</b> <b>erosion</b> of the resistant basalt sill formed monadnocks that have been buried by Tapeats Sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The {{contact between}} the Tapeats Sandstone and Bass Formation {{and the rest of}} the folded and faulted Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} angular unconformity, which is part of the Great Unconformity. The <b>differential</b> <b>erosion</b> of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite as topographic highs, ancient monadnocks, that are now buried by sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the Tapeats Sandstone. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone and other members of the Tonto Group. The {{contact between the}} Bass Formation and the Tapeats Sandstone forms part of a relative flat surface that lies between the monadnocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{cover in the}} SE Zagros is deforming above a layer of rock salt (acting as a ductile decollement with a low basal friction) whereas in the NW Zagros the salt layer is missing or is very thin. This different basal friction is {{partly responsible for the}} different topographies {{on either side of the}} Kazerun fault. Higher topography and narrower zone of deformation in the NW Zagros is observed whereas in the SE, deformation was spread more and a wider zone of deformation with lower topography was formed. Stresses induced in the Earth's crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered sedimentary rocks. Subsequent erosion removed softer rocks, such as mudstone (rock formed by consolidated mud) and siltstone (a slightly coarser-grained mudstone) while leaving harder rocks, such as limestone (calcium-rich rock consisting of the remains of marine organisms) and dolomite (rocks similar to limestone containing calcium and magnesium). This <b>differential</b> <b>erosion</b> formed the linear ridges of the Zagros Mountains.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of wind erosion {{as the dominant}} process involved in eroding crater ejecta deposits on Mars are studied. Present-day crater formation in mid to high latitudes involves impact into some thickness of aeolian debris, while impact in the equatorial zone {{is more likely to}} involve target materials consisting of coarse-grained aeolian lag deposits or even bedrock. Latitudinal variation dominates differences in ejecta emplacement mechanisms and probably differences in patterns of wind erosion of ejecta and surrounding intercrater materials. Escarpments develop as the deposits are eroded back toward crater rims. Erosion only takes places at escarpment edges where surface roughness may be low enough to allow particle entrainment. Preferential preservation of ejecta emplaced in thick debris may occur. An empirical model developed for wind erosion of ejecta deposits in nonmantled areas suggests that removal of ejecta materials on the average is exceedingly slow. Results suggest high <b>differential</b> aeolian <b>erosion</b> rates that are a function of both grain sizes and large-scale surface roughness...|$|R

40|$|Greaves Creek has cut {{a hanging}} valley {{through the entire}} Triassic {{sandstone}} sequence near Blackheath in the western Blue Mountains, New South Wales. Downstream of Beauchamp Falls, it cuts into Permian strata in the Grose Gorge. The hanging valley has a valley-in-valley structure. The narrow inner valley is bounded by high cliffs and its floor is cut by a deep narrow slot canyon where stream incision has occurred without valley widening. The course of the creek is related to joint directions. Intense jointing, minor faulting and sapping influence the stability of cliffs but up to 30 m of incision has occurred without valley widening in the slot canyon. Topographic asymmetry expressed as unequal slopes of the valley sides is related to <b>differential</b> insolation, <b>erosion,</b> vegetation cover, bioturbation and fire intensity. In the western Blue Mountains {{and elsewhere in the}} Sydney Basin asymmetric slopes occur in many other valley-ridge systems, particularly those whose long axes are oriented between about east-west and north-east-south-west.

40|$|The {{geologic}} {{part of a}} seismic {{safety investigation}} of San Andreas Dam focused on a two mile reach of the fault between the dam and Crystal Springs Reservoir. Historical documents and detailed mapping revealed that the 1906 faulting caused 7 to 9 ft of right shear in the left (eastern) abutment and occurred on nearly straight traces that experienced a maximum of 9 ft of slip, 90 per cent of which was concentrated within a zone 100 ft wide. Radiocarbon dates on detrital charcoal from two sites of ponded alluvium established that the 1906 traces have been active {{for at least the}} last 3, 000 yr. Deflected stream channels further indicate that the 1906 traces have been the locus of right slip for the last 6500 yr and perhaps for all of Holocene time. Detailed geomorphic and stratigraphic analyses of one site showed that five 1906 magnitude slip events have occurred within the last 1130 + 160 radiocarbon years from which a minimum strain rate of 1. 2 cm/yr and an average recurrence frequence of 224 + 25 yr can be calculated. Trenches excavated across the 1906 traces of the San Andreas fault revealed that the zone of active faulting is marked by a slow upwelling of highly sheared rock materials.

40|$|The {{vertical}} or lithostatic {{stress is}} an important factor in tectonic and geomechanical studies and is commonly used in the prediction of pore pressures and fracture gradients. However, the vertical stress is not always calculated in situ and the approximation of 1. 0 psi/ft (22. 63 MPa/km) is often used for the vertical stress gradient. Vertical stress has been determined in 24 fields in the Baram Basin, Brunei, using density log and checkshot velocity survey data. The Baram Basin shows a variation in vertical stress gradient between 18. 3 and 24. 3 MPa/km at 1500 m depth below the surface. This variation has a significant effect on in situ stress related issues in field development such as wellbore stability and fracture stimulation. The variation is caused by a bulk rock density change of 2. 48 - 2. 07 g/cm 3 from the hinterland of the delta to its front. <b>Differential</b> uplift and <b>erosion</b> of the delta hinterland and undercompaction associated with overpressure are the interpreted causes of the density and hence vertical stress variation...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous {{dunes and}} eolian limestones are {{considered}} by many to be genetically related to rapid glacio-eustatic fluctuations of sea level. However, while these deposits are widespread along Pleistocene and Holocene low-latitude coasts, older analogs are either extremely rare, or misinterpreted as subaqueous in origin. Medium- to large-scale crossbedded arenaceous limestones of the Pennsylvanian Callville Limestone of southern Nevada, and the correlative Manakacha and Wescogame Formations (Supai Group) and the Permian Pakoon Limestone of western Grand Canyon, although considered marine by earlier workers, contain several diagnostic structures indicative of an eolian origin. They are composed chiefly of thin, inverse-graded laminae produced by the migration and climb of wind ripples. Many are bimodal with the coarse mode never exceeding two millimeters. Sets of cross-strata commonly have irregular upper surfaces produced by <b>differential</b> wind <b>erosion</b> of damp or lightly cemented laminae. Southward-dipping cross-strata in these rocks are the earliest record of a paleowind system that persisted in this region well into Jurassic time. ^ Marine beds that are cyclically interbedded with the eolian deposits did not undergo early lithification. Petrographic evidence includes mechanical breakage of shells, fitted fabrics, and microstylolites. Field evidence includes load casts, desiccation cracks, and deflation lags at the contacts between wackestones and eolian grainstones. Where marine units underwent extensive early lithification, there are no interbedded eolian deposits. ^ The marine units are interpreted as the source of the sediment comprising the eolianites. During eustatic highstands, onshore winds drove beach sediments landward. In contrast to Quaternary examples, the eolian deposits of this study do not cap shallowing upward sequences; beach facies are generally absent. During low-stands, most quartz-rich beach facies were removed by deflation; that material too coarse to be wind-transported accumulated as laterally-persistent gravel lags. Deflation was facilitated by the lack of widespread sea floor cementation (hardgrounds), and an arid paleoclimate which limited the extent of meteoric diagenesis. ...|$|R

The very resistant rocks of the Lower Greensand, in particular the Hythe Beds, have produced prominent escarpments that form an arc around the northern edge of the Low Weald, running parallel to and just south of the chalk escarpment of the North Downs.

Using examples from Sri Lanka, field techniques of biophysical assessment of erosion, conservation, and their impacts are presented, with a focus on Gliricidia contour hedgerows. Techniques, such as measuring the armor layer of small stones, soil pedestals, and sedimentation in drains, are useful to assess erosion rates.

40|$|Beachrocks {{are hard}} coastal {{sedimentary}} formations consisting of various beach sediments, lithified through {{the precipitation of}} carbonate cements. The objectives of this contribution are to (a) collate and review information on the reported occurrences, characteristics and formation mechanisms of beachrocks and (b) consider their impacts on the coastal zone. The analysis of the available information has shown that (a) beachrock formation is a global and diachronic phenomenon and (b) {{the great majority of}} beachrocks are found in tropical/subtropical and low temperate latitude, microtidal coasts. The cementing agents of beachrocks are composed predominantly of the metastable carbonate phases High Magnesian Calcite (HMC) and Aragonite (Ar), appearing in a diverse crystalline morphology. It has been suggested that cement precipitation in the coastal environment is controlled by: (i) the physicochemical conditions; (ii) the presence of organic compounds and microbes; (iii) the magnitude and distribution of the wave energy along the coast; and (iv) the textural characteristics of the constituent sediments. Various theories have been proposed to explain beachrock formation itself, linking the phenomenon to either physicochemical or biological processes. These theories, however, {{do not seem to be}} of universal validity and acceptance, as each is able to explain only some of the reported occurrences. The presence of beachrocks appears to affect beach morphodynamics by: (i) ‘locking’ the beach profile; (ii) modifying the nearshore hydrodynamics; (iii) changing the porous character of the beach and, thus, its response to wave forcing; and (iv) <b>differential</b> bed <b>erosion</b> at the margins of the beachrock outcrops that can alter significantly the long- and, particularly, the cross-shore sediment transport. Therefore, although relict submerged beachrock outcrops may provide some coastal protection by reducing the wave energy impinging onto the coastline, modern beachrocks may promote offshore loss of unconsolidated beach sediments and buried beachrock outcropping. Finally, the presence of beachrocks may have also significant ecological impacts, as the indigenous (mobile substrate) fauna and flora of the beach is replaced by hard substrate benthic assemblages, which are commonly arranged in hydrodynamically-controlled zones...|$|R

40|$|The present {{review is}} aimed at {{correlating}} major geologic events of the Cauvery Basin with analogous global episodes. The Cauvery Basin came into existence due to Gondwana break up during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous by taphrogenic rift process. The first marine transgression close to Aptian/Albian boundary at the western margin of the basin terminates the syn-rift tectonic phase, which is also precise in adjoining Krishna-Godavari (KG) Basin. Two regional tectonic episodes are well documented in the basin which have global significance viz. (1) A major basinal uplift during late Turonian caused by Marion hot mantle plume resulted in widespread subaqueous volcanism {{in the southern part}} of the Cauvery Basin. This uplift also led to relative sea level (RSL) fall of about 100  m in Cauvery and KG Basins and an unconformity of a magnitude of 2. 3  Ma. The RSL fall closely correlates with global sea level fall. This volcanic episode also resulted in Madagascar detachment from India. (2) The reunion hot mantle plume that led to Deccan volcanism in central India resulted in E–SE tilt of the Cauvery Basin during upper Maastrichtian (CF 1 -CF 3 zones). This tilt caused a sea level fall of about 80  m and lateral withdrawal of sea by about 50  km developing a major erosional unconformity ranging in magnitude of ∼ 1. 8 – 30 My. The magnitude of RSL correlates well with global sea level fall. This sea level fall caused widespread development of canyon features in the Cauvery Basin resulting in <b>differential</b> subaqueous <b>erosion.</b> The globally significant ocean anoxic events viz. OAE- 1 b, OAE- 1 d, OAE- 2 and OAE- 3 are fairly discernible in the Cauvery Basin.

40|$|All {{along the}} eastern border of the Andes lie {{foreland}} basins that {{are among the most}} prolific hydrocarbon provinces of the world. Their Cenozoic evolution was controlled by the Andean uplift and its consequences on deformation and sedimentation. In turn, the Andean uplift results from the interplay between the subducting Nazca oceanic plate and the South American continental plate. Although the process exists all along the margin, the subducting plate is not regular including bathymetric anomalies and segments that result in different response in the deformation and active volcanism of the overriding plate. In the Marañón Basin of Peru, evidences allow documenting the consequences of a topographic anomaly subduction on the thermal regime and deformation of the Andean foreland during the Neogene. In this basin, a maturity anomaly is difficult to explain by considering only the present day thermal regime. However, it spatially coincides with the trace of a lost subducting ridge, the Inca Plateau.
