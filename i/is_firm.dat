5|$|Edwin's {{expansion}} to {{the west}} may have begun early in his reign. There <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> evidence of a war waged in the early 620s between Edwin and Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, king of the Ulaid in Ireland. A lost poem {{is known to have}} existed recounting Fiachnae's campaigns against the Saxons, and the Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623–624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin's designs on the Isle of Man, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae's death in 626, at the hands of his namesake, Fiachnae mac Demmáin of the Dál Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae's death a year later in battle against the Dál Riata probably eased the way for Edwin's conquests in the Irish sea province.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and stout, tapering dramatically {{towards the}} tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E

25|$|The {{material}} <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> but malleable {{and allows}} direct suturing of muscles to implant without wrapping or extra steps. Additionally, the smooth surface is less abrasive and irritating than other materials used for similar purposes. Polyethylene also becomes vascularized, allowing placement of a titanium motility post that joins the implant to the prosthesis {{in the same}} way that the peg is used for hydroxyapatite implants.|$|E
25|$|After the {{insulation}} period, the soap <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> {{enough to be}} removed from the mold and cut into bars. At this time, it is safe to use the soap, since saponification is in essence complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2–6 weeks before use. During this cure period, trace amounts of residual lye are consumed by saponification and excess water evaporates.|$|E

25|$|Macroscopically, {{the liver}} is {{initially}} enlarged, {{but with the}} progression of the disease, it becomes smaller. Its surface is irregular, the consistency <b>is</b> <b>firm,</b> and the color is often yellow (if associated with steatosis). Depending {{on the size of}} the nodules, there are three macroscopic types: micronodular, macronodular, and mixed cirrhosis. In the micronodular form (Laennec's cirrhosis or portal cirrhosis), regenerating nodules are under 3mm. In macronodular cirrhosis (post-necrotic cirrhosis), the nodules are larger than 3mm. Mixed cirrhosis consists of nodules of different sizes.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, an {{exception}} is the merchant firm offer rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and irrevocable if it is an offer {{to buy or sell}} goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror. Such an offer is irrevocable {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.|$|E
25|$|Among {{his most}} {{satisfactory}} productions {{are some of}} his earlier ones, such as the full-length of the duke of Argyll, and the numerous bust-portraits of Scottish gentlemen and their ladies which he executed before settling in London. They are full of both grace and individuality; the features show excellent draughtsmanship; and the flesh-painting <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and sound in method, though frequently tending a little to hardness and opacity. His full-length of Lady Mary Coke is remarkable for the skill and delicacy with which the white satin drapery is managed; while the portrait of his brown-eyed second wife Margaret, in the Scottish National Gallery, is described as having a sweetness and tenderness. The portrait of his wife also shows the influence of French art, which Ramsay incorporated into his work. The large collection of his sketches {{in the possession of}} the Royal Scottish Academy and the Board of Trustees, Edinburgh also show this French elegance and soft colours.|$|E

500|$|The white pear- or egg-shaped {{fruit body}} of C.sculpta may be [...] tall by [...] wide. The outer layer of tissue, {{known as the}} exoperidium, is covered on the outer surface with {{distinctive}} long, pointed, pyramid-shaped warts, either erect or bent over and sometimes connected at the tip with other warts. The warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards the base. Mycologist David Arora opined that C.sculpta resembled [...] "a cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue." [...] In age, the peridium sloughs off and exposes a brownish spore mass. The interior of the puffball, the gleba, <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and yellowish-white when young, but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive-brown as it matures.|$|E

500|$|Calvatia sculpta is edible, {{and said}} to be [...] "choice" [...] by some authors. The taste is {{described}} as [...] "mild" [...] and the flesh has no distinguishable odor. Arora recommends eating the puffball only when it <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and white inside, as older specimens may have a distasteful iodine-like flavor. The puffball may be preserved by freezing fresh or partially cooked slices, but their flavor and texture will deteriorate unless cooked immediately after thawing. Recommended cooking techniques for puffball slices include sautéing and coating in batter before frying. C.sculpta {{was used as a}} traditional food of the Plains and Sierra Miwok Indians of North America, who called the fungus potokele or patapsi. Puffballs were prepared by drying them in the sun, grinding them with a mortar, and boiling them before eating with acorn soup.|$|E
500|$|The gills are subdecurrent (running only a {{small way}} {{down the length of}} the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and {{sometimes}} forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult stem is [...] long, [...] thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to pruinose (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish orange to orange white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem <b>is</b> <b>firm,</b> beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white mycelium is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, {{and nearly}} equal in width {{throughout}} or tapering downward. Its surface may be slimy or dry, {{depending on the}} moisture in the environment. It is whitish, but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains. The flesh <b>is</b> <b>firm,</b> and white to buff. Its odor is not distinctive, while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid. The latex is creamy-white on initial exposure, and stains the gills grayish-brown to dark brown or olive-brown; its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid. Older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker-tasting latex. The spore print is pinkish-buff. The edibility of L.argillaceifolius is unknown. The cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied.|$|E

500|$|The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, {{nearly equal}} in width {{throughout}} or enlarged downward, hollow at maturity, sticky to dry, scrobiculate (coarsely pitted), pale yellow to orange-yellow, and stains dull lilac to purple. The flesh <b>is</b> <b>firm,</b> brittle, white, and will stain dull lilac to purple when cut. The odor is sometimes faintly fragrant or not distinctive, {{but when the}} mushroom is dry it smells intensely of soap. Its taste is mild to slightly [...] or somewhat bitter, and the flavor {{has been compared to}} sweet flag (Acorus calamus). The abundant amount of latex produced by the mushroom is white to cream, unchanging, staining all tissues dull lilac to purple. It tastes mild to slightly acrid or somewhat bitter. The spore print is yellowish. The fruit bodies are poisonous and consumption will cause stomach aches, but the nature of the toxic agents has not been identified.|$|E
500|$|The {{cylindrical}} stem measures between [...] {{in length}} by [...] in width, {{though it is}} slightly thicker at the very bottom. It is stiff, but can be somewhat flexible.

The hairs {{at the base of}} the stem are somewhat more visible, and are an amber colour. The gills are subdistant (neither close to, nor distant from, one another) and are of a distinctive shape; they are decurrent, that is, they extend down the stem, and are noticeably arched. The gills can be up to [...] thick, and sometimes split into two. The gills are a tobacco-brown no matter the age of the mushroom, though the edges can be paler (sometimes whitish) and [...] The flesh <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> but flexible, and the same colour as the surface.

The bulb {{at the base}} of the stipe is roughly spindle- to turnip-shaped, and may root deeply into the soil, especially if the soil is loose. The short-lived partial veil is white, and attached just below the top of the stipe. It is sticky and in maturity often clings to the upper part of the stipe, or may have some meagre remnants hanging from the cap margin. The universal veil remains are arranged in rows of warts and patches of gray to brownish-gray small scales over the upper portion of the bulb; below this, the color is a dirty white. The flesh <b>is</b> <b>firm</b> and white. Fruit bodies can range in smell from mild to [...] "slightly unpleasant".
