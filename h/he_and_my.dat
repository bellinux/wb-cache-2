500|$|In November 1963 Mikoyan {{was asked}} by Khrushchev to {{represent}} the USSR at President John F. Kennedy's funeral. At the funeral ceremony, Mikoyan appeared visibly shaken by the president's death and was approached by Jacqueline Kennedy, who {{took his hand and}} conveyed to him the following message: [...] "Please tell Mr. Chairman [...] that I know <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> husband worked together for a peaceful world, and now he and you must carry on my husband's work." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{irony is}} that it was during the time of {{publication}} that my father's relationship with Judah was most strained, and the point of conflict was over the content of the book. Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall. Then <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father retired to another room to talk the issue out. I could tell from the grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences".|$|E
60|$|This old {{neighbor}} went to {{the train}} with us, {{knowing full well that}} <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father would never meet again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{begin to}} think that more possible,' <b>he</b> answered, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> heart bounded as he added, 'she would be {{satisfied}} since you would always have a home with US.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then God bless you!" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> gave <b>my</b> hand {{a hearty}} grip. Then he turned upon his heel and went below, and I {{knew that my}} time for acting had arrived.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> rose <b>and</b> took <b>my</b> hand silently, in his simple, kindly way.|$|R
60|$|This puzzled me yet more; and {{a thought}} coming into my head, I asked if <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{father had been}} twins.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{respected}} {{friend had}} had a laugh and a hug together, our admittedly remarkable boy resumed with a great relish: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Amyas? Yes, my dear. He {{came for}} you. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{father and the}} others are in the other room waiting for you to wake." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> paused, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> uncle Sepa, {{rising from}} his chair, spoke: [...] "We have made {{examination}} of the records and there is none, O Amenemhat. He is of the Royal blood, his descent is true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is Dator Yersted?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{heart sank}} within me, as I cursed {{myself for a}} stupid fool in not having sunk the {{submarine}} to make good the lie that I must tell.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> came <b>and</b> stole <b>my</b> wild honey {{this morning}} while I was asleep ...|$|R
60|$|A look of pain crossed Mr. Banker's face. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{father had}} been warm friends, and I well {{knew that he would}} do all in his power for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is, Roger. My Uncle Dunston {{tells me that}} {{my father is a}} very good {{horseman}} and that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother used often to go out horseback riding together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is the {{dangerous}} man. It was <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father who led Lucien on. If an example {{must be made}} {{it should be an}} example of the guilty rather than of the innocent.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{institutionalised}} {{heroine of}} I Never Promised You a Rose Garden shares {{a room with}} a memory-impaired girl who gives herself multiple sets of musical celebrity parents: [...] "My father - <b>he's</b> Paderewski, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother is Sophie Tucker".|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> seized <b>and</b> held <b>my</b> hand. Then walked blindly to {{the door}} and turned abruptly.|$|R
5000|$|..... it doesn't {{describe}} how I grew up, how I was neglected by my parents. My {{father was a}} drinker <b>and</b> <b>he</b> abused <b>my</b> sister <b>and</b> me. <b>He</b> was choleric <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mom just did nothing, She was more into her affair with another man and her beauty. I was so lonely when I was a kid. I just wanted to belong; I was struggling with the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{diversity}} of gifts. Among other things, {{he appears to}} possess an extensive acquaintance with Colonial politics, and <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father discuss the regeneration of the Government when they might with advantage be doing something else." ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{after it}} was as if we had spent a full day in the smoke-house, the sun went down, and it was yet quite light when Captain Hanaford {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father might safely make the start.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Alton simply. [...] "What {{would any}} son do? But {{it seems to}} me there might be a little {{allowance}} for my grandfather, too, and I think <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father have fixed up that quarrel long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope {{you don't}} mind us coming this way, Ponderevo," [...] <b>he</b> cried; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> uncle, who was {{sometimes}} {{a little too}} general and generous with titles, answered, [...] "Not at all, my lord, not at all! Glad you make use of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|As we {{drew near}} my father raised a signal shout, [...] "Hallo-o-o the House!" [...] {{and a man}} in a long gray coat came out. [...] "Is that thee, friend Richard?" [...] <b>he</b> called, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father replied, [...] "Yea, {{neighbor}} Barley, here we are!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There's Something Between Us <b>and</b> <b>He's</b> Changing <b>My</b> Words" [...] - 1:20 ...|$|R
6000|$|Gahagan.--"Sire, it is true. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> countrymen in your Majesty's service stood {{under the}} green flag {{in the breach}} of Burgos, and beat Wellington back. It was the only time, as your Majesty knows, that Irishmen and Englishmen were beaten in that war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will. You know Mr. Finn. He is here. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> husband are very old friends. And Adelaide Maule is your cousin. She hunts too. And so does Mr. Maule,--only {{not quite so}} energetically. I think that is all we shall have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{hurry up}} and get home," [...] {{declared}} Dave, presently. [...] "I {{want to hear what}} Mr. Wadsworth has to say; and also find out what <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> folks have done towards getting on the track of Porton and his confederate." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{front door}} closed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> returned. <b>My</b> chance of escape had gone.|$|R
60|$|Thereafter {{there was}} no similitude for me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> unhappy estate, save that of a dog who has lost his master in a strange place, and goes questing everywhere, and comfortless. Then Randal Rutherford, coming to visit me, found me such a lackmirth, <b>he</b> said, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> wits so distraught, that a love-sick wench were better company for a man-at-arms.|$|R
60|$|Having {{paid his}} tribesman this compliment, <b>he</b> remounted, <b>and,</b> to <b>my</b> surprise, went {{straight}} {{back the way}} we had come.|$|R
6000|$|Gahagan. [...] "Sire, it is true. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> countrymen in your Majesty's service stood {{under the}} green flag {{in the breach}} of Burgos, and beat Wellington back.

6000|$|... 'Jem never did. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> aunt held back, {{and were}} unwilling to oppose the Squire. They would have given it up, but for me. Father, I never {{supposed}} you could be averse to my doing my utmost for Jem, when all his prospects were at stake.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I trow not! I'll {{have him}} {{with me in}} the camp, and <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> brave men shall be one another's pride. Which Roman emperor is it that hears the {{nickname}} his father's soldiers gave him as a child? Nay--Caligula was it? Omens are against me this morning.' ...|$|E
60|$|He ceased {{speaking}} {{suddenly as}} if having {{said more than}} <b>he</b> intended, <b>and</b> again <b>my</b> tongue was an unruly member.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is then. <b>And</b> if <b>he</b> brings Sexty <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{little ones}} to the workhouse, what'll be the good then of his guano and his gum?" ...|$|R
