40|$|This article {{describes}} a low-cost image acquisition and processing system, which measures several yarn production characteristics, namely, the fibers twist orientation, the <b>folded</b> <b>yarn</b> twist step, the <b>folded</b> <b>yarn</b> twist orientation, {{and the existence}} of single (nonfolded yarn) or multiple cables (<b>folded</b> <b>yarn).</b> The imaging hardware consists of a USB web camera coupled to an analog microscope and a monochromatic light source. The acquired images are analyzed using custom designed software based on the IMAQ Vision image program from National Instruments. A full description of the developed image processing tool is presented, together with several experimental results. The results obtained are consistent with information deduced from high-resolution images acquired using an electron microscope. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Investigations of the {{influence}} of the knit structure, i. e. the loop length and the number of yarns in a loop, on flammability and comfortability are presented in this paper. The investigations were carried out using single jersey knits from Delta TA 18 tex × 2 yarns with five variants of a loop length. Single yarn as well as <b>folded</b> <b>yarn</b> from two single yarns was used in the investigations. Comparison of the results of single-layer knits flammability and air permeability with those of multilayer packet was made. The results obtained show that an increase in the loop length of the knit increases their permeability to air and decreases the burning time as well as {{increase in the number of}} layers decreases the air permeability and increases the burning time. Moreover, the similar burning time with significantly different permeability to air can be achieved changing the basic knitting parameters, i. e. the loop length and/or the yarn linear density...|$|E
40|$|Modeling the 3 D {{geometric}} {{configuration of}} yarn is {{the base of}} building the 3 D fabric structure. The surfaces of the yarns are modeled by many facets. To improve the efficiency of modeling, 3 D yarn is usually designed by Bezier curve, spline curve or B-spline curve {{on the principle of}} Com-puter Graphics. The paper reviews different 3 D modeling methods for single yarn from the view of cross-section and central line. Some improvements for a better visual effect such as inserting twist and hairiness are illustrated as well. Based on the single yarn, the <b>folded</b> <b>yarn</b> and some fancy yarns can also be modeled in 3 D space as long as the cross-sections of the control sections of the component single yarn are determined. Applications of the various 3 D yarns are demonstrated. The advantages and the drawbacks of various methods are explained and compared as well. Com-paratively speaking, modeling technology based on spline curve is more convenient and flexible, perhaps it is the most popular tool since it is capable of designing different kinds of yarns men-tioned above and gets the maximum support from the different developing platforms such a...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{present study was}} to compare plain knitted fabrics comfort properties realized with hybrid and ring cotton <b>folded</b> <b>yarns</b> formed of two single yarns. The quality of the knitted fabric is determined by adiathermic power, air permeability and abrasion resistance. The results indicate that the plain knitted fabrics properties made of hybrid <b>folded</b> <b>yarns</b> are similar to those made of ring <b>folded</b> <b>yarns.</b> In addition to that, we notice that the yarn linear density and the folding twist factor have the most important effect on plain knitted fabrics properties realised with hybrid and ring <b>folded</b> <b>yarns.</b> This result is of a great industrial interest because the hybrid <b>folded</b> <b>yarns</b> costs less dearly than the ring <b>folded</b> <b>yarns.</b> In present study, Statistical models of the prediction are being presenting describing the variation of knitted fabric characteristics with the spinning and folding parameters and single yarns properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of folding provides a complex yarn differing to an appreciable degree from single components. Although {{the characteristics of}} <b>folded</b> <b>yarns</b> {{have been the subject}} of many investi-gations, there is a serious lack of study concerned with the influence of <b>yarn</b> <b>folding</b> on comfort properties of clothing materials. Therefore, this study focused on the effect of <b>yarn</b> <b>folding</b> on both thermal and tactile comfort of plain knitted fabrics. In addition to the structural characteristics of the yarns and knitted fabrics, the transport properties, deformation behavior and surface properties of the knitted fabrics were investigated. The results obtained indicated that the influence of <b>yarn</b> <b>folding</b> on thermal and tactile comfort properties of clothing materials is mainly positive. These effects were caused by the modification of yarn packing density which further influenced the air volume distri-bution as well as the fiber and yarn mobility within the fabric.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the media have {{highlighted}} the damage {{of the ozone layer}} and the resulting increase of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the earth’s surface. Prolonged and repeated, both occupational and recreational, sun exposure of the population causes some detrimental effects. Clothing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important tools for UV protection. It is generally accepted that synthetic fibres provide a high UV protection capability of textiles, while cellulose fibres (cotton, linen, hemp, viscose) have a low UV absorption capacity. However, natural pigments, pectin and waxes in natural cellulose fibers, and lignin in hemp fibers, act as UV absorbers having a favorable effect on UPF of grey-state fabrics. Bearing in mind the trend of reintroduction of hemp fibers as a source of eco-friendly textiles, there is a serious lack of study about the potential of hemp materials in terms of UV protection. <b>Folded</b> <b>yarn</b> is a complex yarn composed of two or more component yarns arranged parallel and twisted together to make a “new quality” yarn. Folding of yarns is an operation undertaken in order to modify single-yarn properties to an appreciable degree. There are very few investigations concerning the relationship between the yarn properties and UV protection effectiveness of the fabric made there from. In addition, there is no any result in the scientific literature about the influence of yarn folding on UV protection properties of textile materials. Having this in mind, for our research the idea was to evaluate the effect of yarn folding in this regard. The plain knitted fabrics composed of single or two-folded hemp yarn were compared in terms of UV protection properties. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as the quantitative measurement of the material effectiveness to protect the human skin against UVR, was determined for the textile materials by in vitro test method according to the European standard EN 13758. The knitted fabrics construction and physical properties were also determined. Bearing in mind that plain knitted fabrics are particularly susceptible to relaxation, they were subjected to relaxation and shrinkage by wetting process, and testing procedure was repeated on the water-treated samples. The results obtained indicated that the folding operation influences UV protection properties of knitted fabrics through an influence on a loop configuration, i. e. the fabric openness. Relaxation and shrinkage of the knitted fabrics due to wet relaxation caused the reduction of macro-porosity increasing the UPF of the knitted fabrics. Although the knitted fabric produced from single hemp yarn was characterized by higher UPF, the UVR transmittance of the folded hemp yarn knitted fabric after wet relaxation placed it in the “excellent UV protection category” (according to European Standard EN 13758 - 2). This fact together with the better thermal comfort manifested itself in higher air permeability, confirmed the potential of folding operation in terms of UV protection properties of textile materials...|$|E

According to the {{characteristics}} of the aluminum conductors, coated-steel reinforced (ACSR), combined the feature that isotropic and continuity of the <b>folded</b> <b>yarns,</b> establish the calculated equation of the Poisson ratio of the discrete and anisotropic wires. After given the calculated equation of stiffness of large cross-section wires, we obtained the calculated equation of elastic modulus, shear modulus and Poisson ratio. These wires stiffness not only reflect {{the characteristics}} of the composite material, but also provide guidance and reference for the mechanical calculation of the wires and installation of overhead conductor and ground wires and the following equation also has certain value in mechanics calculation and lines of construction...|$|R
25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as warp threads in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or <b>folds</b> the single <b>yarns</b> around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of delivery rollers {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a flyer twisting frame. On the flyer twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the bobbin. The machine is hand doffed.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that synthetic fibres provide high UV protection capability of textile products, while cellulose fibres have low UV absorption capacity. However, textile materials made {{of synthetic fibres}} are {{not considered to be}} comfortable for wear in warm weather, whereas cellulose-based textile materials are considered to be much more comfortable to wear, especially in the summer months. For this research, the idea was to produce specially blended knitted fabrics from staple/fi lament hybrid yarns in order to provide clothing materials with eff ective UV protection properties, keeping satisfactory comfort properties as well. To obtain hybrid <b>yarns,</b> <b>folding</b> technique was used. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as a quantitative measure of the eff ectiveness of the material to protect human skin against UV radiation, was determined for the rib knitted fabrics by in vitro test method according to the European standard. The physical properties of the knitted fabrics related to their UV protection properties: bulk density, porosity and air permeability were also determined. The hybrid yarns, from which the rib knitted fabrics were produced, having always hemp yarn as a staple component, caused the differences in UV protection capability of the rib knitted fabrics through the influence of a filament spun component. The hybrid yarn aggregation within knitted fabrics also fibrestheir UPF values. Even though the pure hemp knitted fabric was marked as “UPF> 50 ” (according to European standard) due to natural pigments and lignin in hemp fibres which act as UV absorbers, most of the hemp/fi lament hybrid yarn knitted fabrics exhibited even higher UPF. Therefore, the engineering approach proposed in this research was confi rmed as an eff ective way to design clothing materials with optimal UV protection capability and other wear comfort parameters...|$|R
