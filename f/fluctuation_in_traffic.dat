40|$|Traffic signal {{control is}} {{commonly}} used at road intersections to minimise vehicular delay. Fixed time control shows good results in conditions {{where there is a}} little <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> demand, however in time-varying traffic fixed time control becomes inflexible and inefficient. This may produce traffic congestion and lead to increased delays and air pollution. Demand responsive traffic signal control must be introduced to overcome these problems. However, all the available demand responsive traffic signal control methods such as Vehicle Actuated Controller (VAC), Traffic Optimisation Logic (TOL), Microprocessor Optimised Vehicle Actuation (MOVA) and Fuzzy Logic Traffic Signal Controllers (FLTSC) have been developed for non-mixed traffic conditions, considering only motor vehicles move in clearly defined lanes, neglecting motorcycles. These demand responsive traffic signal controls are not appropriate for the mixed traffic conditions of developing countries such as Indonesia, where the traffic streams consist of different types of vehicle with a wide variation in their static, dynamic and operating characteristics, and with a particularly high proportion (30...|$|E
40|$|Estimation {{of delay}} at signalized intersections {{is a complex}} process and depends {{on a number of}} pa-rameters, among which the degree of {{saturation}} (x = v/c) is the most important. This paper presents a new methodology for estimating delay parameter k, and proposes an analytical delay model for signalized intersections that considers the variation in traffic flow. Unlike the existing delay models in the literature, the delay parameter k is not a fixed value and is expressed {{as a function of the}} degree of saturation. The proposed model is applicable to the entire range of expected operation including highly oversaturated traf-fic conditions. A comparative study of the proposed model against the existing models was performed to verify the improvements by the proposed model. Later, the TRAF-NETSIM (Traffic Network Simulation) microscopic simulation model was used in the calibration and verification of the new delay model for over-saturated conditions. The simulation was conducted in 3 consecutive time periods to reflect <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> demand.

Datla and Sharma [8, 9, 10, 11] developed percentage reduction factors using a traffic–weather model in order to compensate the reduction that resulted from each cm of snowfall and temperature drop below 0  °C at a scale of 5  °C. The study showed {{that the difference between}} the precision of estimation of AADT from short-period counts taken during the winter and summer seasons was reasonably small. The study compared AADT estimates using the traditional factor method for sample counts taken during summer months (May–September) and those using a method that applies the traffic–weather model for sample counts taken during winter months (November–March). The sample counts were taken at a commuter and a recreational site during both seasons, and the estimated AADT errors were produced using a similar method to that used by Gulati [7]. The reported AADT estimation errors for the proposed method, which was applied to sample counts taken in the winter, were 22.87 % for recreational roads and 13.86 % for commuter roads, whereas for traditional factor method (for sample counts taken in the summer), they were 18.11 % and 12.57 % for recreational and commuter roads, respectively.|$|E

The aim of the paper {{is to determine the}} packet length effect on the effective radio networks transmission rate with taking into account the parameters, formats, and procedures of the physical and link levels at using the MAC protocol with a rigid strategy of competitive access to the radio channel. Methods. The goal is achieved by creating and analyzing the mathematical model of the effective transmission rate in radio networks. The model is described by the equation for the effective transmission rate, which is the function of both the probability of the conflict-free transmission of the MAC protocol and the coefficient of the data packet size deviation from the optimal for LLC protocol. Results. It is proved that there is the optimal deviation of the data packet length for each MAC protocol traffic intensity value, which provides the most effective transfer rate. This makes the possibility for adaptive management of the radio bandwidth by applying a pre-calculated deviation of the data packet size in dependence on the traffic intensity. Conclusions. The proposed mathematical model is the tool for calculation of both the radio bandwidth network capacity and the optimal deviation of the data packet length at adaptive management of competitive access to a radio channel with a rigid strategy at conditions of the significant <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> intensity...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we develop}} a {{mathematical}} framework to estimate lane-based incremental queue accumulations with group-based variables and a predictive model of lane-based control delay. Our {{objective is to}} establish the rolling horizon approach to lane-based control delay for group-based optimization of signal timings in adaptive traffic control systems. The challenges involved in this task include identification of the most appropriate incremental queue accumulations based on group-based variables for individual lanes to the queueing formation patterns and establishment of the rolling horizon procedure for predicting the future components of lane-based incremental queue accumulations in the time windows. For lane-based estimation of incremental queue accumulations, temporal and spatial information were collected {{on the basis of}} estimated lane-based queue lengths from our previous research to estimate lane-based incremental queue accumulations. We interpret the given signal plan as group-based variables, including the start and duration of the effective green time and the cycle time. Adjustment factors are defined to identify the characteristics of the control delay in a specific cycle and to clarify the relationship between group-based variables and the temporal information of queue lengths in the proposed estimation method. We construct the rolling horizon procedure based on Kalman filters with appropriate time windows. Lane-based queue lengths at an inflection point and adjustment factors in the previous cycle are used to estimate the adjustment factors, arrival rates, and discharge rates in the next cycle, in which the predictive computation is performed in the current cycle. In the simulations sets and the case study, the proposed model is robust and accurate for estimation of lane-based control delay under a wide range of traffic conditions. Adjustment factors {{play a significant role in}} increasing the accuracy of the proposed model and in classifying queueing patterns in a specific cycle.

We demonstrate that these self-assembled bridges are a highly effective means of maintaining traffic flow over unpredictable terrain.

We employ a parameterized computational model to reveal that bridges are tuned to be maximally stable in the face of regular, periodic <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>traffic.</b> However analysis of the model also suggests that interactions among ants give rise to feedback processes that result in bridges being highly responsive to sudden interruptions <b>in</b> <b>traffic.</b> Subsequent field experiments confirm this prediction and thus the dual nature of stability and flexibility in living bridges.

40|$|When {{congestion}} {{becomes a}} problem on a road or road network, there are generally three main solution areas available to tackle it: construction, pricing or traffic management. Traffic management became an increasingly preferred option {{towards the end of}} the twentieth century as an alternative to construction <b>in</b> many cases. <b>Traffic</b> management proves a more efficient alternative and focusses on influencing traffic flows such that the existing road and network capacity is more effectively utilised resulting in a reduction in congestion. The effectiveness of traffic management is dependent on the ability to influence traffic flow. However, traffic contains a relatively large amount of stochastic behaviour, which is connected to human driving behaviour. The <b>fluctuations</b> that occur <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> flow due to this stochastic behaviour have a large effect on the effectiveness of traffic management. Furthermore, uncertainty between time dependant scenarios has also shown to have a large influence on the outcome of the analysis of <b>traffic</b> management measures. <b>In</b> the past, little attention has been paid to these effects. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to give insight into the stochastic <b>fluctuations</b> and uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> flow for the application of traffic management measures and to propose tools that allow these effects to be analysed and subsequently modelled in aggregated macroscopic flows. In doing this, the necessity to consider uncertainty and fluctuations for traffic management is also demonstrated. Stochastic processes are considered as uncertainty, which describes day-to-day uncertainties between traffic flows, and fluctuations, which describes microscopic variability <b>in</b> the <b>traffic</b> flow.

Specifically, we attempt to develop a basic understanding, using analysis and simulation, of the properties of TCP/IP in a regime where (1) the bandwidth-delay product of the network is high compared to the buffering in the network, and (2) there may be transient congestion due to <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> real-time <b>traffic,</b> modeled here as producing random losses among the packets of the TCP connection of interest. The following key results are obtained. First, random loss leads to significant throughput deterioration when {{the product of the}} loss probability and the square of the bandwidth-delay product is larger than one. Unless network resources are specifically reserved for data traffic, data traffic will inevitably incur random losses due to transient <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> higher priority real-time t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Today’s routers need {{to perform}} packet {{classification}} at wire speed {{in order to}} provide critical services such as traffic billing, priority routing and blocking unwanted Internet traffic. With ever-increasing ruleset size and line speed, the task of implementing wire speed packet classification with reduced power consumption remains difficult. Software approaches are unable to classify packets at wire speed as line rates reach OC- 768, while state of the art hardware approaches such as TCAM still consume large amounts of power. This paper presents a low power architecture for a high speed packet classifier which can meet OC- 768 line rate. The architecture consists of an adaptive clocking unit which dynamically changes the clock speed of an energy efficient packet classifier to match <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> on a router line card. It achieves this {{with the help of a}} scheme developed to keep clock frequencies at the lowest speed capable of servicing the line card while reducing frequency switches. The low power architecture has been tested on OC- 48, OC- 192 and OC- 768 packet traces created from real life network traces obtained from NLANR while classifying packets using synthetic rulesets containing up to 25, 000 rules. Simulation results of our classifier implemented on a Cyclone 3 and Stratix 3 FPGA, and as an ASIC show that power savings of between 17 - 88 % can be achieved, using our adaptive clocking unit rather than a fixed clock speed...|$|R
