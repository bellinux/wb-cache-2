NY324 heads south, {{overlapping}} with I-190 (the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) across the North Grand Island Bridge to Grand Island, where <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> expressway at exit20. However, as signed, NY324 {{begins at the}} north end of Grand Island, where it splits off from the Interstate Highway as Grand Island Boulevard. South of exit20, the official and signed routings are identical.|$|E
5|$|Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} Briar Creek Township. It flows east {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south through a gap in Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of Briar Creek {{and picks up the}} tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Mellenville, NY217 intersects with CR9 (Mellenville Road), with NY217 serving as CR9's {{southern}} terminus. NY217 then heads southeast, crossing Claverack Creek and passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north {{as well as the}} adjacent Claverack Town Park. The route turns eastward and meets the northern terminus of Roxbury Road as it enters the village of Philmont. Within Philmont, NY217 follows Main Street through {{the center of}} the densely populated village. At an intersection with Maple Street, the highway comes within view of Summit Lake, a small water body in the center of Philmont.

Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} terminus of NY42's southern segment {{marks the}} small hamlet of Big Indian, after which Esopus Creek crosses {{for the last}} time, turning south to its source at Winnisook Lake. The road begins a sustained climb {{over the next two}} miles paralleling an Esopus tributary, Birch Creek, up to Pine Hill.

The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east in a patch of woodland and passing more farm fields and residences. MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes Sassafras Street.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|M-119 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US31 about four miles (6.4km) northeast of Petoskey near {{the community of}} Bay View in Bear Creek Township.

Passing west of Wampus Brook Park, NY128 intersects with Old Mount Kisco Road, an old alignment as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> town center.

Upon intersecting Croton Dam Road, NY134 turns northward and immediately intersects NY9A at an at-grade intersection.|$|E
