2500|$|The bonobo ( [...] or Pan paniscus), {{formerly}} {{called the}} pygmy chimpanzee and less often, the dwarf or <b>gracile</b> <b>chimpanzee,</b> is an endangered great ape {{and one of}} the two species making up the genus Pan; the other is Pan troglodytes, or the common chimpanzee. Although the name [...] "chimpanzee" [...] is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee, whereas Pan paniscus is usually referred to as the bonobo.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Professor John Allman, a neuroscientist, {{and colleagues}} at the California Institute of Technology first {{published}} a report [...] on spindle neurons found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of hominids, but not in any other species. Neuronal volumes of ACC spindle neurons were larger in humans and the <b>gracile</b> (slender) <b>chimpanzees</b> than the spindle neurons of the robust gorillas and orangutans.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{primates}} examined {{had more}} spindle {{cells in the}} fronto-insula of the right hemisphere than in the left. In contrast to the higher number of spindle cells found in the ACC of the <b>gracile</b> bonobos and <b>chimpanzees,</b> the number of fronto-insular spindle cells was far higher in the cortex of robust gorillas (no data for Orangutans was given). An adult human had 82,855 such cells, a gorilla had 16,710, a bonobo had 2,159, and a chimpanzee had a mere 1,808despite the fact that chimpanzees and bonobos are great apes most closely related to humans.|$|R
