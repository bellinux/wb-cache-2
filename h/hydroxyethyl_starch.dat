Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>starch</b> (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO).

At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E

The thrombelastograph is commonly used to assess point-of-care whole blood coagulation. Little is known about the dose-response relationships of haemodilution, and {{it is reasonable to assume}} that a linear association exists. This may not be the case with altered electrolyte compositions of the fluids used for haemodilution. We have therefore conducted an in vitro study of haemodilution of human whole blood using lactated Ringer's solution and two high molecular weight hetastarches, one in a balanced salt solution, the other in a 0. 9 % saline solution. The thrombelastograph, commonly used for the assessment of the coagulation effects of synthetic colloids, was used as the coagulation assessment device. Serial haemodilution with hetastarch in a balanced salt solution demonstrated a biphasic response (of r-times and k-times, as well as alpha angles), with haemodilution in the 20 - 40 % range causing enhanced coagulation, and higher degrees of dilution causing a decrease in overall coagulation performance. A similar picture was observed with lactated Ringer's solution, but only significantly so in alpha angles. Hetastarch in saline did not display this initial increased coagulability at mild to moderate dilutions. This biphasic response of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch in a balanced salt solution reflects the complex interaction of fluids and the coagulation system, and that these effects cannot be attributed to simple haemodilution. On the other hand, there was a linear decrease in maximum amplitude with haemodilution.

30|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} no strong indication as to what constitutes a “better” fluid selection in improving morbidity and mortality rates in sepsis [3], there is increasing evidence since several decades that (1) patients receiving the largest fluid resuscitation were those with the worse outcome [43, 44], (2) adverse events and outcomes can occur as early as 12  h after sepsis onset when fluid resuscitation is sustained [44], and (3) sepsis-associated AKI is both common and costly (e.g., renal replacement therapy—RRT).

40|$|Used for the {{treatment}} of hypovolemia, colloid solutions have actually supplanted albumin solutions. These solutions of macromolecules include dextrans, gelatins, and <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>starches</b> (HES). All these synthetic colloids interfere with the physiologic mechanism of haemostasis causing a non specific alteration of coagulation correlated to the amount of haemodilution and associated with specific effects due to the macromolecules. However, these effects on haemostasis have little clinical impact provided safety measures are observed. These consist of strict observation of the maximal daily dosage and of the duration of treatment. Caution should be taken also in patients presenting with haemostasis abnormalities and with haemodilution greater than 30 % of patient's blood volume. Albumin could then be chosen for plasma expansion. Among the different types of macromolecules solutions, gelatins and low or medium molecular weight HES (LMWHES) have less effect on blood loss than dextrans or high molecular weight HES (HMWHES). The recently developed HES, 130 / 0. 4 (Voluven®) has less impact on haemostasis as compared with gelatins, increasing the authorized volume of administration to 50 mL/kg per day.

40|$|Papermakers {{are highly}} {{interested}} in upgrading mechanical paper by retarding or inhibiting the lignin color reversion. Yellowing {{can be prevented}} by screening UV light {{on the surface and}} adding yellowing inhibitors into papers. Surface treatment of paper in a size press by an inhibitor-starch mixture has more advantages compared to other methods. A novel microscopy technique using scanning electron microscopy is developed to identify and measure the polymer penetration into sized sheets. The kinetics of starch adsorption on wood fibers was elucidated. An initial high adsorption of cationic starch on pulp fibers is off set by high desorption rates. Furthermore the adsorption of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> ether <b>starch</b> increases smoothly with time due to polymer penetration into the macropores. At high salt concentrations, cationic starch does not make strong bonds with negatively charged fibers and as a result the desorption rate increases and the maximum adsorption approaches zero. The presence of salt has little effect on the adsorption of non-ionic <b>hydroxyethyl</b> ether <b>starch.</b> Preferential adsorption of amyIose compared to amylopectin on cellulosic fibers is related to the size exclusion mechanism involved in polymer penetration into macropores. The presence of cationic starch clusters is confirmed. The clusters initially adsorb on the fiber surface; however due to a higher desorption rate they are gradually replaced by individual polymers. The cluster size decreases with increasing shear in the presence of salt in cationic starch solutions. The cluster desorption rate for pulp fibers is higher than that for glass substrates. This might be due to different surface chemistry or roughness between pulp fibers and glass substrates. The maximum adsorption on glass substrates increases by increasing the cluster size. <b>Hydroxyethyl</b> ether <b>starch</b> does not form clusters and shear and the presence of salt have a minor effect on the polymer size. Starch pickup by paper during surface sizing depends on the liquid absorption at the puddle and counter pressure of the trapped air in the pores. Starch viscosity, paper velocity and nip load have no effect on the thickness of the starch layer across the sized paper. However, for thick boards penetration increases by increasing the nip load due to lower sheet thickness at higher nip load. For sized board, the starch penetration is less for cationic <b>starch</b> than for <b>hydroxyethyl</b> ether <b>starch</b> due to higher viscosity and adsorption. For the sized sheets with yellowing inhibitor/starch mixtures, the paper brightness after aging is affected by inhibitor concentration in the solution, since operating conditions have little effect on pickup.

METHODS: Twenty-four pigs were normovolemically hemodiluted up {{to a total}} exchange of 50 ml. kg. body weight of HES 650 / 0. 42 or HES 130 / 0. 42. Serial blood sampling was performed to measure HES plasma concentration and to assess blood coagulation. Concentration-effect relations were analyzed by linear regression, followed by the Student t test on regression parameters. RESULTS: Blood coagulation was increasingly compromised toward hypocoagulability by acute normovolemic hemodilution with both treatments (P 0. 05). A significantly lesser decrease of hemoglobin concentration has been found with HES 650 / 0. 42 as compared with HES 130 / 0. 42 (P < 0. 01) in relation to HES plasma concentrations.

The volume effect should be stable and reliable, offer a constant plateau effect and be easily controllable. Many in depth characteristics has been offered by recognized societies [1] and includes: no tissue storage, no plasma accumulation, no influence on haemostasis, no influence on the immune system, no infectivity, no antigenicity, no allergenic potential, no proinflammatory properties, no toxicity, teratogenity or mutagenity, no influence on diagnostic tests, good compatibility with other medication, good tolerance, and complete elimination.
