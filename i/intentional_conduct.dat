5000|$|In law, liable means [...] "responsible or {{answerable}} in law; legally obligated." [...] Legal liability concerns both {{civil law}} and criminal law and can arise from various areas of law, such as contracts, torts, taxes, or fines given by government agencies. The claimant {{is the one}} who seeks to establish, or prove, liability. Claimants can prove liability through a myriad of different theories, known as theories of liability. Which theories of liability are available in a given case depends on nature of the law in question. For example, in case involving a contractual dispute, one available theory of liability is breach of contract; or in the tort context, negligence, negligence per se, respondeat superior, vicarious liability, strict liability, or <b>intentional</b> <b>conduct</b> are all valid theories of liability.|$|E

[...] Even with <b>intentional</b> <b>conduct,</b> absent material damage, claims for emotional harm were similarly barred. [...] "Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value, and does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone.

5000|$|The term Prāyaścitta, and {{variations}} such as Prāyaścitti, {{appear in the}} Vedic literature.

In other cases, such as in Taittiriya Samhita 5.3.12.1, the word Prāyaścitti appears with the meaning of expiation for a sin. The error or mistake mentioned in the ancient Hindu texts, such as the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic texts, as well as various Sutras and Shastras, include those related to ritual procedure such as letting the altar fire go out, or unintentional breaking a cooking pot, or an <b>intentional</b> inappropriate <b>conduct,</b> and any range of events where a person feels remorseful.|$|R

50|$|On appeal, the Appellate Division {{set aside}} the appellant’s {{conviction}} of murder (and the imposition of the death sentence), and found him guilty of culpable homicide. The {{court held that the}} causing of death by <b>intentional</b> <b>conduct</b> (which the appellant was held to have foreseen) was markedly different from causing death by involuntary conduct (the way in which the death in fact occurred). The court accepted that death caused by the involuntary discharge of the firearm might have been foreseen by another individual, but the appellant, who had failed Standard 6, and was of low intelligence, had not been proved to have foreseen this sequence of events. The court therefore found the appellant guilty only of culpable homicide (on the basis that a reasonable person in the place of the appellant would have foreseen the possibility of death resulting from the involuntary discharge of the firearm). The appellant was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|After {{considering}} the punitive damage policies of foreign nations, the Court reasoned that although punitive damages were warranted, {{they may not}} exceed what Exxon already paid to compensate victims for economic losses, which was about US$500 million. ItIt argued that a one-to-one ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was [...] "a fair upper limit" [...] in maritime cases that involved recklessness, compared to the lower liability of negligence or the higher liability of <b>intentional</b> <b>conduct.</b> [...] Its reasoning, [...] "The real problem, it seems, is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards," [...] frustrates the goal of punitive damages, deterring reprehensible conduct, because predictable damages create an incentive to continue dangerous misconduct if the personal injury liability {{is less than the}} potential profit, as on the Ford Pinto. It suggested giving a [...] "bad man" [...] the chance to look ahead and to calculate the consequences of doing or not doing a bad act will deter harmful actions. He suggests the upper limits on punitive damages should be as predictable as the legislative range of criminal sentences, but no minimum for punitive damages were discussed.|$|E
50|$|Police {{officers}} in Lexington, Kentucky, entered {{an apartment building}} {{in pursuit of a}} suspect who sold crack cocaine to an undercover informant. The officers lost sight of the suspect and mistakenly assumed he entered an apartment from which they could detect the odor of marijuana. After police knocked on the door and identified themselves, they heard movements, which they believed indicated evidence was about to be destroyed. Police forcibly entered the apartment and found Hollis King and others smoking marijuana. They also found cash, drugs and paraphernalia. King entered a conditional guilty plea; reserving his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless search were not of the police's making and that police did not engage in deliberate and <b>intentional</b> <b>conduct</b> to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was improper. The court held that the police were not in pursuit of a fleeing suspect when they entered the apartment since {{there was no evidence that}} the original suspect even knew that he was being followed by police.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} {{and maintenance of}} the International Space Station (ISS) {{has led to the}} release of many objects into its orbital plane, usually during the course of an extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Such releases are often unintentional, but in a growing number of cases, the jettison has been <b>intentional,</b> <b>conducted</b> after a careful assessment of the net risk to the partnership and to other objects in space. Since its launch in 1998 the ISS has contributed on average at least one additional debris object that is simultaneously in orbit with the station, although the number varies widely from zero to eight at any one moment. All of these objects present potential risks to other objects in orbit. Whether it comes from known and tracked orbiting objects or from unknown or untrackable objects, collision with orbital debris can have disastrous consequences. Objects greater than 10 cm are generally well documented and tracked, allowing orbiting spacecraft or satellites opportunities to perform evasive maneuvers (commonly known as Debris Avoidance Maneuvers, or DAMs) in the event that imminent collision is predicted. The issue with smaller debris; however, is that it is too numerous to be tracked effectively and yet still poses disastrous consequences if it intercepts a larger object. Due to the immense kinetic energy of any item in orbit, collision with debris as small as 1 cm can have catastrophic consequences for many orbiting satellites or spacecraft. Faced with the growing orbital debris threat and the potentially catastrophic consequences of a collision-generated debris shower originating in an orbit crossing the ISS altitude band, in 2007 the ISS program manger asked program specialists to coordinate a multilateral jettison policy amongst the ISS partners. This policy would define the acceptable risk trade rationale for intentional release of a debris object, and other mandatory constraints on such jettisons to minimize the residual risks whenever a jettison was accepted. Although ISS-related debris often presents untenable risks to the EVA crew, IVA crew, or to a departing cargo vehicle for a controlled disposal, such released objects also present a ballistic nuisance to the visiting vehicle traffic, and a potential fragmentation threat to the hundreds of other functional and debris objects whose perigees lie below the ISS orbital altitude. Thus, every such jettison decision is a conscious risk trade...|$|R

Aims: To investigate the influence of prescribed psychotropic medications on the odds of coingesting alcohol preceding or during intentional efforts to self-poison. Method: A cross-sectional analysis of consecutive hospital presentations following <b>intentional</b> self-poisoning was <b>conducted.</b> A total of 7270 patients (4363 women) aged 18 - 96 were included. Results: The odds of alcohol coingestion were increased in those not prescribed any medication (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 27, 99 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 46, P 50. 001) and in impulsive self-poisonings (OR= 1. 39, 99 % CI 1. 11 - 1. 74, P 50. 001).
