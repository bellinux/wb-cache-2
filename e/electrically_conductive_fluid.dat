25|$|Europa {{has much}} {{indirect}} evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa {{is affected by}} Tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water or warm ice in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the Galileo spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens {{the case for a}} liquid, rather than solid, layer; an <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluid</b> deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa {{due to the lack of}} water in the space near Europa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnetic}} reconnection theory {{relies on}} the solar magnetic field to induce electric currents in the solar corona. The currents then collapse suddenly, releasing energy as heat and wave energy in the corona. This process is called [...] "reconnection" [...] because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in plasma (or any <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluid</b> such as mercury or seawater). In a plasma, magnetic field lines are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the topology of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south magnetic pole are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to [...] "reconnect" [...] to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.|$|E

The MHD power losses are evaluated and discussed. The model is easy to implement and could be a useful tool for the design and the optimization.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} flowmeter is obstructionless and {{insensitive to the}} metered stuff's constitutive properties. For low zero-point drift, EM flowmeters employ a low frequency alternating induction, usually with square waveshape. With conventional signal conditioning, high frequency induction leads to excessive zero-point drift for the instrument. The conventional instrument is usable with <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluids,</b> {{where there is no}} triboelectric noise. Nonconductive fluids have substantial triboelectric noise, with spectral density experimentally measured to be f{sup {minus} 2. 6 }. Here we use an electromagnet and signal conditioner that allows high frequency induction, where the noise is low, but eliminates the heretofore excessive drift [...] such that the EM flowmeter can be used to meter any stuff, whether conductive or insulating, that can be pumped, blown or extruded through a pipe. Designs and test hardware are shown. An injury occurred, with slow recovery: the principal investigator could not do all the flow test stand work desired. As an option, the flow testing has been simulated on a computer. Using characteristics of transformer oil as the metered fluid, the new signal conditioner has produced: (1) signal/noise/drift behavior experienced in prior published work, and (2) signal [...] without noise and drift [...] with performance of today's commercial EM flowmeters...|$|R

50|$|The Faraday {{generator}} {{is named}} after the man who first looked for the effect in the Thames river (see history). A simple Faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-conductive material. When an <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluid</b> flows through the tube, {{in the presence of}} a significant perpendicular magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the field, which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|In plasma physics, {{waves in}} plasmas are an {{interconnected}} set of particles and fields which propagates in a periodically repeating fashion. A plasma is a quasineutral, <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluid.</b> In the simplest case, it {{is composed of}} electrons and a single species of positive ions, {{but it may also}} contain multiple ion species including negative ions as well as neutral particles. Due to its electrical conductivity, a plasma couples to electric and magnetic fields. This complex of particles and fields supports a wide variety of wave phenomena.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive micro-lenses {{enable the}} design of very compact optical systems with tunable imaging properties. Conventional {{adaptive}} micro-lenses suffer from substantial spherical aberration that compromises the optical performance of the system. Here, we introduce a novel concept of liquid micro-lenses with superior imaging performance that allows for simultaneous and independent tuning of both focal length and asphericity. This is achieved by varying both hydrostatic pressures and electric fields to control {{the shape of the}} refracting interface between an <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> lens <b>fluid</b> and a non-conductive ambient fluid. Continuous variation from spherical interfaces at zero electric field to hyperbolic ones with variable ellipticity for finite fields gives access to lenses with positive, zero, and negative spherical aberration (while the focal length can be tuned via the hydrostatic pressure) ...|$|R

The basic elements of a chemical battery are a pair of electrodes of different electrochemical properties and a liquid or moist paste electrolyte.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Industrial applications of fuel cell technologies offer a major research opportunity. To realise the goal of practical commercial applications of this developing technology will involve {{the integration of the}} latest developments in electrical, fluid and chemical engineering systems. Although each field is well developed in its own right, the novel concept of combining these technologies within computational models offers the potential for new understanding and design procedures to be created. This multi-disciplinary approach would offer new insights into the fundamental physical phenomena, as well as creating tools {{that can be used for}} designing fuel cells and is the major focus of the research described in this thesis. Power storage fuel cells are the subject of this research. This particular fuel cell is a bipolar stack with two, single phase, liquid electrolytes. A review of the current techniques highlighted the need to address the study of the loss mechanisms present in the fuel cell. The prediction of short circuits created by the <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>fluids</b> required an electrical model. The power consumed driving the fluid system compelled a fluid dynamics model. These were combined within this work, to optimise the geometrical properties of this type of fuel cell based on general chemical kinetic and operating parameters. In order to satisfy the operating requirement of even distribution of reactants to the active areas, a finite-volume technique based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was developed. This enabled the prediction of the transport processes for fluid flow, electrical energy transfer and chemical species conversion throughout the fuel cell. The complexity of the multi-disciplinary CFD method required the use of parallel computers to reduce the lead times. The CFD approach is employed best studying small sections of the fuel cell system highlighting important phenomena. This research has already influenced design variations and has guided the direction of additional research, namely ways of electrically isolating the fluid without interrupting the flow. This work has successfully demonstrated that computational modelling can predict fuel cell electrochemical phenomena in a fraction of the time and cost of experimental procedures. This research is being used to benefit the design process and further the exploitation of fuel cell technologies. Finally, by extending the research into porous media and two phase flow these techniques could be applied to all types of fuel cell...|$|R
