Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally discharges his gun, killing himself. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection {{was introduced to the}} base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg who the infected ignored.

500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
2500|$|Non-English {{versions}} of the game omit the section {{at the beginning of}} CD2, where Guybrush's crew sings the song [...] "A Pirate I Was Meant To Be". In this section, the player as Guybrush has to stop the crew's singing - however, at each attempt, they just start a new stanza rhyming to the player's line, until <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> line ending with the word [...] "orange" [...] making the song unable to continue.

As such, Itagaki refuses {{to make a}} handheld game for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), stating it goes against the design philosophy of being a handheld device. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> game created, {{based on the specifications}} of the PSP, would be more suited for a true home console.

2500|$|The God Who Risks has {{a section}} where Sanders delineates his sources and four {{criteria}} for a successful theological proposal. [...] First, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> theological model must agree with the major themes of Scripture. It need not agree with each and every biblical text, however. Second, it must find consonance with Christian tradition. He notes that there are multiple streams of tradition so a theological model {{is not likely to}} agree with all of them. Third, it must have conceptual intelligibility which includes logical consistency and comprehensiveness. He rejects theological ideas that are self-contradictory since they are “literally ‘nonsense’ and unintelligible.” Fourth, a good theological proposal must help one live out the Christian life by providing meaning to real-life situations. He acknowledges that these criteria do not offer a definitive way to resolve all theological differences and that theological diversity should be expected. This is why he says we need to practice dialogical virtues.|$|E
2500|$|Amid this {{metropolitan}} culture {{the city}} burghers {{had built a}} sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who {{had the right to}} trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population. This was notoriously the age of [...] "rotten" [...] and [...] "pocket" [...] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. [...] "Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals {{to make use of the}} electoral process." [...] "Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed," [...] says , describing other towns under the control of a single fiefdom. In Norwich, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>a</b> powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [...] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [...] worshipping at the Octagon Chapel.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Geoffrey Cocks {{has extended}} Blakemore's {{idea that the}} film has a subtext about Native Americans to arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust (Both Cocks' book and Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life {{to make a film}} dealing directly with the Holocaust, but could never quite get the handle on it that satisfied him). Cocks is a cultural historian best known for describing the impact of the Holocaust on subsequent Western culture. Cocks, writing in his book The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust, proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>a</b> strong (though hidden) holocaust subtext in The Shining. This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone. [...] Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane's short story [...] "The Blue Hotel" [...] (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture. In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as [...] "homey".|$|E
