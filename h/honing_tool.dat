Its movement form is equivalent to a pair of gears transmission which the surface of the gear-honing-tool is adhered a layer of grinding grain. When it works in rolling processing, the contact-point between the workpiece and gear-honing-tool is moving. Then the moving point becomes a line in the space, and with the gear-honing-tool being in axial play, a standard flank of tooth is finished. Using the gear meshing principle, kinematics model of relative sliding velocity in the contact- point between the workpiece and tools is established, based on which the contact-line equation. and acceleration equation. at the contact-point are derived. The contact-line is solved in a given parameters of the workpiece and tool in MATLAB. The theoretical derivation and experimental results show that the speed in diverse along the direction of the tooth depth is the main reason for the roughness value and surface texture of workpiece. The acceleration of contact-line at the tooth flank is different, and it is leading reason that the processed workpiece gears appear profile distortion. Finally, the testing system is established for researching honing gear process.

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the honed work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the <b>honing</b> <b>tool</b> combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a radial feeding movement of the honing stone. The interface between honing stone and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the honing stone are very important for the process. Nowadays, there are two different control strategies for the feeding movement of the honing stone: feed-controlled and force-controlled honing. While force- controlled honing tries to keep a constant process force, feed-controlled honing feeds the honing stone in certain steps in certain time intervals. The force-controlled approach can bring better results of the process regarding the quality parameters and the tool wear. But to be able to hone force-controlled the correlation of the process forces has to be known. This paper presents a first theoretical approach to the relations beweeen the forces during the honing process.

40|$|The {{physical}} structuring {{of silicon}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern microelectronics and integrated circuits. Typical structuring of silicon requires generating a plasma to chemically or physically etch silicon. Although many tools have been created to do this, the most finely <b>honed</b> <b>tool</b> is the Inductively Couple Plasma Reactive Ion Etcher. This tool has the ability to finesse structures from silicon unachievable on other machines. Extracting structures such as high aspect ratio silicon nanowires requires more than just this tool, however. It requires etch masks which can adequately protect the silicon without interacting with the etching plasma and highly tuned etch chemistry able to protect the silicon structures during the etching process. In the work presented here, three highly tuned etches for silicon, and its oxide, will be described in detail. The etches presented utilize a type of etch chemistry which provides passivation while simultaneously etching, thus permitting silicon structures previously unattainable. To cover the range of applications, one etch is tuned for deep reactive ion etching of high aspect ratio micro-structures in silicon, while another is tuned for high aspect ratio nanoscale structures. The third etch described is tuned for creating structures in silicon dioxide. Following the description of these etches, two etch masks for silicon will be described. The first mask will detail a highly selective etch mask uniquely capable of protecting silicon for both etches described while being compatible with mainstream semiconductor fabrication facilities. This mask is aluminum oxide. The second mask detailed permits for a completely dry lithography on the micro and nanoscale, FIB implanted Ga etch masks. The third chapter will describe the fabrication and in situ electrical testing of silicon nanowires and nanopillars created using the methods previously described. A unique method for contacting these nanowires is also described which has enabled investigation into the world of nanoelectronics.

40|$|The {{demands on}} {{decreased}} environmental impact from vehicles force {{the automotive industry}} to develop engines with reduced engine oil and fuel consumption. Frictional losses in the piston ring cylinder liner system accounts for approximately 20 % of the total frictional losses within an engine. Engine oil consumption is recognized {{to be a significant}} source of pollutant emissions. Unburned or partially burned oil in the exhaust gases contribute directly to hydrocarbon and particulate emissions. Engine oil and fuel consumption are to a great extend controlled by the topography of the cylinder liner surface. The tribological considerations in the contact between the piston ring and cylinder liner have attracted much attention over several decades. Many non-conventional cylinder liner finishes has been and are being developed with the aim to reduce oil- and fuel consumption, but the effects of surface finish on piston ring pack performance is not well understood. To enable the study of impact from cylinder liner topography on cylinder system performance, an improvement in liner finish characterisation is needed to be able to discriminate surface features important for function. Also in manufacturing quality control issues {{there is a need for}} surface characterisation methods that are robust and reasonably fast. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate different roughness characterisation systems stability and ability to discriminate surface features. One seemingly obvious useful characterisation method for plateau honed surfaces is the Rk parameter family based on the bearing area curve. But there is a interdependency between the parameters within the parameter family which makes it very difficult to specify a surface that is possible to manufacture in a controlled way. The Rxq family is more promising in describing the different stages in the honing process. Liner surfaces with finer finish show a decrease in oil consumption in engine tests.

If social equality is a goal of education, then most educational programs (including the more prevalent ones within the field of adult education) are misdirected. This is because most educational programs are wedded to a socially bankrupt theory of development [...] human capital theory. The theory is socially bankrupt because it ignores extra-educational barriers to social equality such as those related to the distribution of jobs in the economy, position in the world economy, gender, race and class. Treating social maladies such as poverty and income inequality as solely the result of "illiteracy," educational programs tend to offer, as the only solution to these maladies, more access of marketable skills (human capital). But there is evidence that increased access to, and equalization of, marketable skills, by themselves, have not alleviated social maladies.

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke <b>honing</b> process the <b>tool,</b> equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the radial feed movement of the honing stone. This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the honing stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the honing stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the honing machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the honing stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the honing stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters.

First, we proposed a design of experiment (DOE) to analyse, experimentally, the chip formation and the resulting surface integrity during the high speed machining under dry condition. The orthogonal cutting mode, adopted in these experiments, allowed to explore, theoretically, the effects of technological (cutting speed and feed) and physical (cutting forces, temperature, shear angle, friction angle, and length Contact tool/chip) parameters on the chip formation mechanisms and the machined surface characteristics (residual stress, plastic deformation, phase transformation, etc.). The cutting conditions were chosen while maintaining a central composite design (CCD) with two factors (cutting speed and feed per revolution). For the aluminum 7075 -T 651, the results showed that the formation of BUE and the interaction between the tool edge and the iron-rich intermetallic particles are the main causes of the machined surface damage. The BUE formation increases with the cutting feed while the increase of the cutting speed reduces it and promotes the BUL formation on the rake face of the cutting tool. We demonstrated also that by controlling the cutting speed and feed, it is possible to generate a benchmark residual stress state and good surface finish which can improve the in-service life of structural parts made of AA 7075 -T 651 aluminum alloys. In this context, correlations have been established between the stress state and the cutting parameters such as cutting forces, shear angle and friction angle. We also investigated the effects of cutting conditions on surface integrity of induction hardened AISI 4340 steel (58 - 60 HRC) using mixed ceramic inserts. This investigation was motivated by the fact that excessive induction hardening treatment resulted in deep hardened layers (2 mm) with related low compressive residual stresses which may affect the performance of the induction heat treated parts. A judicious selection of the finishing process that eventually follows the surface treatment may overcome this inconvenient. The results showed that the machining process induces significant compressive residual stresses at and below the machined surface. The residual stress distribution is affected by the cutting feed and the cutting speed. On one hand, surface residual stress tends to become tensile when the cutting speed is increased. On the other hand, an increase in cutting feed accentuates surface damage whilst it increases compressive surface residual stress. Microstructural analysis shows the formation of a thin white layer less than 2 μm and severe plastic déformations beneath the machined surface. These results attest that the dry hard machining using ceramic tools may be an alternative to grinding, considered expensive and time consuming, since an enhanced surface integrity in terms of residual stresses and microstructure conditions can be achieved. The first step of this study (experimental study) showed that the surface integrity is closely related to the mechanisms of chip formation. These mechanisms, which are the origin of thermo-mechanical loads, can be quantified by two main parameters: the cutting forces and temperatures generated during machining. Therefore, any attempt to predict the characteristics of the machined surface integrity (residual stresses, transformation phase, etc.), should be, necessarily, involve the prediction of cutting forces and temperature generated during the machining. In this study, we opt out to develop a model for predicting cutting forces and temperatures based on a constitutive equation of the work material that takes into account the effect of strain, strain rate, and temperature. Therefore, the second step of this approach has focused on the identification of the Marusich constitutive equation in order to model the behavior of the materials in high-speed machining. To do so, we proposed an original methodology for identifying the coefficients of Marusich’s constitutive equation (MCE) which demonstrated a good capability for the simulation of the material behaviour in high speed machining. The proposed approach, which is based on an analytical inverse method together with dynamic tests, was applied to aluminums 6061 -T 6 and 7075 -T 651, and induction hardened AISI 4340 steel (60 HRC). The analytical method consists of determining the material constants inversely using machining tests combined with the response surface models established in the part one of the present thesis. In this section, we investigated the sensitivity of the material constants to the selected temperature models used in the inverse method. Two sets of material coefficients, for each work material, were determined using two different temperature models (Oxley and Loewen-Shaw). The obtained constitutive equations were validated using dynamic tests and finite element (FE) simulation of high speed machining. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the selected temperature model used in the analytical inverse method affected significantly the identified material constants and thereafter predicted dynamic response and machining modeling. In general, material constants obtained using Oxley temperature model gave satisfactory results, compared to Loewen and Shaw model, in predicting the dynamic behaviour and also in predicting the cutting forces during the finite element simulation of the high speed machining of the tested materials. Finally, the material models which were identified in the previous step were thereafter implemented in a developed analytical model for predicting cutting forces and températures (the third step of the approach). We tested only the coefficients obtained by the Oxley temperature model, due to their better performance in predicting the cutting forces in FEM compared to those obtained by model Loewen and Shaw ones. This part of the study aimed to verify the coefficients determined for materials and also to generalize the Oxley machining theory for high speed machining of aluminum and hard steel alloy using semi-sharp and <b>honed</b> cutting <b>tool</b> edges. The predicted results were compared with experimental data from the present study and from the literature, covering a large range of cutting conditions (speed, feed, and rake angle). An encouraging good agreement has been found between predicted and measured cutting forces for all tested materials. The strain rate constants in the primary and secondary shear zone were found {{to be sensitive to the}} cutting conditions and their effects on the predicted data were discussed in detail. Thanks to the Marusich’s constitutive equation, the Oxley’s machining theory was extended to the high speed machining of aeronautic aluminum alloys and induction hardened steels. The proposed predictive model can be extended also to the prediction of the residual stresses whose their prediction using finite element method is complex and time consuming. Through this experimental and theoretical study, we were able to emphasize the physical mechanisms that govern the chip formation and their effects on the machined surface integrity of two classes of metals (ductile and hard). The proposed approaches can be used in the optimization of the cutting conditions in order to control the surface integrity on the machined parts. Furthermore, the results of this study have been validated for feed rates (10 to 50 μm) comparable to the cutting edge radius (5 and 25 μm) used in the experiments. Thus, the developed models (analytical and finite element) can be extended for studying and modeling the conventional machining processes (turning, milling, and drilling) and nonconventional ones such as the micro-machining process...|$|R
