5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and are incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest X {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Astoltia, with the player {{character}} being initially human before an attack by the Lord of Hell Nelgel forces their soul <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> another race. Following this, they must gather magical gems to seal Nelgel once again, while the player character's sibling is sent back in time to be safe from Nelgel. Gameplay follows a combination of elements from the Dragon Quest and other contemporary MMORPGs, such as real-time combat in an open world environment and a job system tied to skills and abilities.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the city}} of Hirasaki in modern-day Japan, the story follows a college student whose death at the hands of demons forces his soul <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> Summoner Kyouji Kuzunoha. Now in Kuzunoha's body, the protagonist must {{investigate}} the appearance of demons in the town and the activities of Sid Davis, the Dark Summoner responsible for killing the protagonist and Kuzunoha. The gameplay carries over multiple classic elements from the Megami Tensei series, including first-person dungeon navigation, turn-based battles, and negotiation with demons to recruit them into the player's party.|$|E

It was all too ridiculous, the introducing of disruptive foreign substances <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> little black men-folk. It was laughable to behold Science prostituting all the might of its achievement and the wit of its inventors to the violent introducing <b>of</b> foreign substances <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> black folk.|$|R

5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth centuryAD, {{copies of his}} orations multiplied {{and they were in}} a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth centuryAD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from {{the blood of the}} last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E

5|$|The song's Bad Boy remix {{featured}} a different music video as well. It features the same concept, however not emphasizing on the kidnapping and escape. The video begins with Carey diving into the pool, and driving a watercraft. As she reaches a point far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> water, she is offered a rope lift from a helicopter. After she accepts and ascends the line, Carey boards the aircraft alongside its pilots, Puffy {{and the members}} of Bad Boy Entertainment. Other scenes sequence Carey dancing with Puffy in a golden indoor tunnel. As the video concludes, more staff from the helicopter join Carey in the golden entryway, as they dance and enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Jardine was {{appointed}} captain of England for the 1931 season, replacing Percy Chapman who {{had led the}} team in 1930. He defeated New Zealand in his first series, but opinion was divided as to how effective he had been. The following season, he led England again and {{was appointed}} to lead the team to tour Australia for the 1932–33 Ashes series. A meeting was arranged between Jardine, Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr and his two fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel to discuss a plan to combat Bradman. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl on leg stump and make the ball rise <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the batsman. The bowlers agreed they could, and that it might prove effective. Jardine also visited Frank Foster to discuss his field-placing in Australia in 1911–12.|$|E
5|$|Kearsley's {{version was}} a marked popular success. Over {{the next few}} years, the {{publishing}} house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.|$|E

50|$|In Greek mythology, the Elasioi (Ancient Greek: Ἐλάσιοι, meaning 'Averters' or 'Expellers'; in Latin, 'Elasii') were minor personages {{with power}} to avert epileptic attacks. In {{the case of}} someone {{suffering}} an epileptic episode in progress, they were sometimes said to cure the ailment by banishing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> wild goats.|$|R
5|$|Following Jardine's appointment, {{a meeting}} was {{arranged}} with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr {{and his two}} fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was vitally important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.|$|E
5|$|In most battle situations, Aya is {{accompanied}} by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in certain situations, dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> an allied NPC, taking on their health level, position and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, or until the unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive {{can also be used to}} attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy.|$|E
