5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation.</b> In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E
5|$|His son Charles I {{attempted}} to impose {{elements of the}} English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the Bishops' Wars (1637–40), ending in defeat for Charles and helping {{to bring about the}} War of Three Kingdoms. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the Second and Third Civil Wars (1648–51) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son Charles II, leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and incorporation into the Commonwealth. The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 saw the return of episcopacy and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic James VII, there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89, William of Orange and Mary, the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After severe <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> in the 1690s there were moves that led to political union with England as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as Jacobitism, leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.|$|E

25|$|After about 1600, the Ottomans {{resorted to}} {{military}} rule {{in parts of}} Greece, which provoked further resistance, and also led to <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> and accelerated population decline. Ottoman landholdings, previously fiefs held directly from the Sultan, became hereditary estates (chifliks), which could be sold or bequeathed to heirs. The new class of Ottoman landlords reduced the hitherto free Greek farmers to serfdom, leading to depopulation of the plains, and to the flight of many people to the mountains, in order to escape poverty.|$|E
25|$|The Panic of 1873 and the {{subsequent}} depression had several underlying causes, of which economic historians debate the relative importance. American post-Civil War inflation, rampant speculative investments (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US, a large trade deficit, ripples from <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), property losses in the Chicago (1871) and Boston (1872) fires, and other factors put a massive strain on bank reserves, which plummeted in New York City during September and October 1873 from US$50 million to $17 million.|$|E
25|$|The strike {{produced}} severe <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation.</b> The country's GDP fell 27% {{during the}} first four months of 2003, and it cost the oil industry $13.3bn. Open unemployment, which was running about 15% before and after the shutdown, reached 20.3% in March 2003; the volume of crude oil produced was 5% less in 2003 than the previous year; and the volume of refined oil products was 17% less. During the lockout Venezuela had, {{for the first time in}} the country's history, defaulted on its international petroleum supply contracts, unable to meet its commitments – including to its principal customer, the United States.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to its economic crisis, the government launched Operation Agriculture, which involved a massive volunteer cotton planting effort on virgin lands.

50|$|The {{construction}} of railroads and the <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations</b> {{caused by the}} war had doomed steamboats {{as a method of}} transportation on the upper Columbia.

25|$|The Russian {{labour force}} is {{undergoing}} tremendous changes. Although well-educated and skilled, {{it is largely}} mismatched to the rapidly changing needs of the Russian economy. The unemployment rate in Russia was 5.3% as of 2013. Unemployment is highest among women and young people. Following {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and the <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> it engendered, the standard of living fell dramatically. However, since recovering from the 1998 economic crisis, the standard of living has been on the rise. As of 2010 about 13.1% of the population was living below the poverty line, compared to 40% in 1999. The average yearly salary in Russia was $14,302 (about $23,501 PPP) as of October 2013, up from $455 per year in August 1999.|$|E
500|$|Population {{growth and}} <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> {{from the second}} half of the sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy. The {{government}} reacted with three major pieces of legislation in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 act was modelled on the English act passed two years earlier and limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of [...] "masterful beggars", including jugglers, palmisters and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers were to draw up lists of deserving poor and each would be assessed. Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the stocks or otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy. Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship.|$|E
500|$|Limited {{demographic}} {{evidence indicates}} a generally expanding population, limited by short-term subsistence crises, {{of which the}} most severe was probably that of the [...] "seven ill years" [...] of the 1690s. The urban centres of the burghs continued to grow, with the largest being Edinburgh, followed by Glasgow. Population growth and <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> from {{the second half of}} the sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy, which was responded to by a series of Acts of Parliament that established what would become the [...] "Old Poor Law", which attempted to ensure relief for the [...] "deserving" [...] local poor, but punishments for the mobile unemployed and beggars. The patriarchal nature of society meant that women were directed to be subservient to their husbands and families. They remained an important part of the workforce and some were economically independent, while others lived a marginal existence. At the beginning of the period women had little or no legal status, but were increasingly criminalised after the Reformation, and were the major subjects of the witch hunts that occurred in relatively large numbers until the end of the seventeenth century.|$|E
2500|$|While the purges quelled outward {{manifestations of}} dissatisfaction, they also caused severe <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations.</b> [...] Large {{construction}} projects were launched with insufficient capital such that unpaid prisoners {{were required to}} serve in place of modern equipment.

50|$|Contributing {{to these}} {{political}} and <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations</b> {{was a large}} incursion of Arab beduin from Egypt starting {{in the first half}} of the 11th century. Part of this movement was an invasion by the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes, apparently sent by the Fatimids to weaken the Zirids. These Arab beduin overcame the Zirids and Hammadids and in 1057 sacked Al Qayrawan. They sent farmers fleeing from the fertile plains to the mountains and left cities and towns in ruin.|$|R
50|$|Originally, New York Avenue Extended {{passed through}} {{relatively}} rural areas, where farms and small, isolated developments were common. But during the road's first 30 years, {{the area around}} it transformed into a major industrial corridor. The <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations</b> of the 1970s, however, led to rapid deindustrialization along New York Avenue. By the late 1970s, many industrial businesses along the route were closed or abandoned, and retail was relatively nonexistent. The residents in the surrounding neighborhoods were very poor, unemployment was high, and environmental problems were severe.|$|R
500|$|In the Middle Ages Scotland {{had much}} more limited {{organisation}} for poor relief than England, lacking the religious confraternities of the major English cities. It possessed a few hospitals, bede houses and leper houses, which offered confinement rather than treatment. Because so many Scottish parishes had been impropriated for some religious foundation, {{perhaps as many as}} 87 per cent, funds were not available for local causes such as poor relief. Protestant reformers in the Book of Discipline (1560) proposed that part of the patrimony of the Catholic Church be used to support the poor, but this aim was never realised. Population growth and <b>economic</b> <b>dislocation</b> from {{the second half of the}} sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy. The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation on poverty and vagrancy in 1574, 1579 and 1592.

Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship. Poor rates were very slow to be set up in the burghs, with Edinburgh the first as a result of the outbreak of plague in 1584. It was then gradually introduced in other cities, such as St Andrews in 1597, Perth in 1599, Aberdeen in 1619, and Glasgow and Dundee in 1636.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the effects of economic globalisation, the compensation hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between trade openness {{and the size of the}} public sector, as governments perform a risk mitigating role in the face of internationally generated risk and <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations.</b> Statistically, support for the compensation hypothesis should entail a positive causality running from trade-openness to government size. We use time series data − for 23 industrialised OECD countries over the 1948 - 1998 period − to test this hypothesis within the framework proposed by Sims and Granger. Our findings fail to provide overwhelming support for it...|$|R
2500|$|Both ZAPU and ZANU began {{campaigns of}} guerrilla warfare around 1966. Initially, {{it was rather}} sporadic, limited in its scope and consequences.

In 1974, the major African nationalists groups, (ZAPU) and (ZANU), were united into the [...] "Patriotic Front" [...] and combined their military forces, at least nominally. These guerrilla raids led to escalation in white emigration from Rhodesia. This violent struggle {{became known as the}} Rhodesian Bush War, lasting from 1966 to 1979. The accounts of some of these guerrilla incursions into Rhodesia are described in the Peter Stiff novel, The Rain Goddess.|$|E
2500|$|Camden {{quickly became}} an industrialized {{city in the}} later {{half of the nineteenth}} century.

40|$|Self-employment {{and public}} {{emergency}} work were frequent {{reactions to the}} <b>economic</b> <b>dislocations</b> of the Great Depression. Census data for men show that in urban-industrial centers, self-employment reduced the demand for public emergency work by absorbing displaced workers into the entrepreneurial sector. Census data for women reveal that, in these centers, self-employment and public emergency work coexisted due to mutually beneficial relations between women who were self-employed and those women who worked on government projects. The results suggest that, contrary to popular theoretical and ideological views, there is no inherent conflict between private- and public-sector responses to stagnant labor markets...|$|R
