50|$|The total cohomology of {{a compact}} Kähler {{manifold}} has a mixed Hodge structure, where the nth {{space of the}} weight filtration Wn is the direct sum of the cohomology groups (with rational coefficients) of degree {{less than or equal}} to n. Therefore, one can think of classical Hodge theory in the compact, complex case as providing a <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> on the complex cohomology group, which defines an increasing fitration Fp and a decreasing filtration Wn that are compatible in certain way. In general, the total cohomology space still has these two filtrations, but they no longer come from a direct sum decomposition. In relation with the third definition of the pure Hodge structure, one can say that a mixed Hodge structure cannot be described using the action of the group C*. An important insight of Deligne is that in the mixed case there is a more complicated noncommutative proalgebraic group that can be used to the same effect using Tannakian formalism.|$|E

30|$|For {{substrate}} configuration CIGSe devices (Fig.  2 a), {{the light}} entering through the metal grid spacing and TCO (Al:ZnO/i-ZnO) may suffer reflection loss due to {{difference in the}} refractive index (n). These reflection losses can be minimized by employing anti-reflective coating such as MgF 2 [30]. The operation of the devices can be explained {{on the principle that}} upon illumination, the generated electron–hole pair is swept away by the built-in electric field at the CdS/CIGSe heterojunction interface towards the respective contacts to produce photocurrent. Some of the electrons can also move towards the wrong contact (back contact) and recombine. This can be avoided by introducing a back surface field, an additional energy barrier for preventing the electron back flow. The band-gap gradient can be achieved by varying the GGI ratio. Figure  2 b shows the energy-band diagram of CIGSe device with (dotted), without <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> (continuous line) and the energy-band-gap profile of the CIGS absorber layer used in simulation is given in Fig.  2 b, inset. The experimental and simulation studies have shown that <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> in the CIGS absorber layer has greatly improved the performance of single-junction CIGS cells [40, 41].

40|$|Device {{modeling}} and simulation studies of a Cu(In 1 -x,Gax) Se 2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell have been carried out. A variety of graded band-gap structures, including space charge region (SCR) grading, back surface region grading, and <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> of the CIGS absorber layer, are examined. The device physics and performance parameters for different band-gap profiles were analyzed. Based on the simulation results, an optimal graded band-gap structure for the CIGS solar cell is proposed. The performance of the optimally graded band-gap cell is superior {{to that of the}} uniform band-gap cell. The SCR grading of the CIGS absorber layer improves the open-circuit voltage (Voc) without significantly sacrificing the short-circuit current (Jsc) compared to the uniform band-gap CIGS. The back surface grading enhances both Voc and Jsc. An optimal graded band-gap profile, such as a <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> consisting of the SCR grading and back surface grading, improves significantly the efficiency up to 19. 83 % AM 1. 5 G compared to the uniform band-gap profile with 15. 42 % efficiency. A comparison of the simulation results with published data for the CIGS cells shows an excellent agreement of photo- current density- voltage and quantum efficiency characteristics.

We state an analogue of the classical Hermite reciprocity law, and recover the Hilbert series associated with a suitable <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> via elementary theory of partitions. Together with classical covariants of binary forms other remarkable mathematical notions, such as orthogonal polynomials and cumulants, {{turn out to have}} a natural and simple interpretation in this algebraic framework.

40|$|The Wheeler-DeWitt {{equation}} for the minimally coupled FRW-massive-scalar-field minisuperspace {{is written}} as a two-component Schreodinger equation with an explicitly `time'-dependent Hamiltonian. This reduces {{the solution of}} the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to the eigenvalue problem for a non-relativistic one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and a series of trivial algebraic equations whose inductive solution may be easily found. In particular, it is shown that there is a simple <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> of the solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation which determines two classes of definite-parity solutions. A detailed analysis of these solutions is performed. Since every solution may be written as the superposition (sum) of the definite-parity solutions, the analysis of the latter yields the structure of the general solutions. Furthermore, it is shown that real solutions such as that of Hartle and Hawking have definite parity.

Suppose that all proper faces of X/T are acyclic. In the paper we study the homological spectral sequence E^*_*,* H_*(X) {{corresponding to the}} filtration of X by orbit types. When the free part of the action is not twisted, we describe the whole spectral sequence in terms of homology and combinatorial structure of X/T. In this case we describe the kernel and the cokernel of the natural map k[X/T]/(l. s. o. p.) → H_*(X), where k[X/T] is a face ring of X/T and (l. s. o. p.) is the ideal generated by a linear system of parameters (this ideal appears as the image of H^> 0 (BT) in equivariant cohomology. There exists a natural <b>double</b> <b>grading</b> on H_*(X), which satisfies bigraded Poincare duality. This general theory is applied to compute homology groups of origami toric manifolds with acyclic proper faces of the orbit space. A number of natural generalizations is considered. These include Buchsbaum simplicial complexes and posets. h'- and h"-numbers of simplicial posets appear as the ranks of certain terms in the spectral sequence E^*_*,*. In particular, using topological argument we show that Buchsbaum posets have nonnegative h"-vectors. The proofs of this paper rely on the theory of cellular sheaves. We associate to a torus space certain sheaves and cosheaves on the underlying simplicial poset, and observe an interesting duality between these objects.

40|$|The steeply dipping, isoclinally folded early Precambrian (Archean) Berry Creek Metavolcanic Complex {{comprises}} primary to resedimented pyroclastic, epiclastic and autoclastic deposits. Tephra {{erupted from}} central volcanic edifices was dumped by mass flow mechanisms into peripheral volcanosedimentary depressions. Sedimentation has been essentially contemporaneous with eruption and transport of tephra. The monolithic to heterolithic tuffaceous horizons are interpreted as subaerial to subaqueous pumice and ash flows, secondary debris flows, lahars, slump deposits and turbidites. Monolithic debris flows, derived from crumble breccia and dcme talus, formed during downslope collapse and subsequent gravity flowage. Heterolithic tuff, lahars and lava flow morphologies suggest at least temporary {{emergence of the}} edifice. Local collapse may have accompanied pyroclastic volcanism. The tephra, produced by hydromagmatic to magmatic eruptions, were rapidly transported, by primary and secondary mechanisms, to a shallow littoral to deep water subaqueous fan developed upon the subjacent mafic metavolcanic platform. Deposition resulted from traction, traction carpet, and suspension sedimentation from laminar to turbulent flows. Facies mapping revealed proximal (channel to overbank) to distal facies epiclastics (greywackes, argillite) intercalated with proximal vent to medial fan facies crystal rich ash flows, debris flows, bedded tuff and shallow water to deep water lava flows. Framework and matrix support debris flows exhibit a variety of subaqueous sedimentary structures, e. g., coarse tail grading, <b>double</b> <b>grading,</b> inverse to normal grading, graded stratified pebbly horizons, erosional channels. Pelitic to psammitic AE turbidites also contain primary stru~tures, e. g., flames, load casts, dewatering pipes. Despite low to intermediate pressure greenschist to amphibolite grade metamorphism and variably penetrative deformation, relicts of pumice fragments and shards were recognized as recrystallized quartzofeldspathic pseudomorphs. The mafic to felsic metavolcanics and metasediments contain blasts of hornblende, actinolite, garnet, pistacitic epidote, staurolite, albitic plagioclase, and rarely andalusite and cordierite. The mafic metavolcanics (Adams River Bay, Black River, Kenu Lake, Lobstick Bay, Snake Bay) display _holeiitic trends with komatiitic affinities. Chemical variations are consistent with high level fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, amphibole, and later magnetite from a parental komatiite. The intermediate to felsic (64 - 74 % Si 02) metavolcanics generally exhibit calc-alkaline trends. The compositional discontinuity, defined by major and trace element diversity, {{can be explained by}} a mechanism involving two different magma sources. Application of fractionation series models are inconsistent with the observed data. The tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites are probably derived by low pressure fractionation of a depleted (high degree of partial melting) mantle source. The depleted (low Y, Zr) calc-alkaline metavolcanics may be produced by partial melting of a geochemically evolved source, e. g., tonalitetrondhjemite, garnet amphibolite or hydrous basalt...|$|E

Here, we investigate the correlation between Se incorporation, phase formation and Ga segregation during fast selenisation of Cu In Ga precursor films in elemental selenium vapour. Se incorporation and phase formation are analysed by real time synchrotron based X ray diffraction and fluorescence analysis. Correlations between phase formation and depth distributions are gained by interrupting the process at several points and by subsequent ex situ cross sectional electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The presented results reveal that the main share of Se incorporation takes place within a few seconds during formation of In Se at the top part of the film, accompanied by outdiffusion of In out of a ternary Cu In Ga phase. Surprisingly, CuInSe 2 starts to form at the surface {{on top of the}} In Se layer, leading to an intermediate <b>double</b> <b>graded</b> Cu depth distribution.
