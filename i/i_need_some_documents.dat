60|$|But I did {{go back in}} 1915.

We had music, books, magazines--everything that could be thought of.|$|R
60|$|And {{the story}} about George Washington and his little hatchet has also been {{suggested}} to me in these letters--in a fugitive way, as if <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> of George Washington and his hatchet in my constitution.

My eyes fell upon nothing familiar.|$|R

He {{suggested}} I switch to Italian-style briefs, {{the ones with the}} T-shaped crotch that tends to build you up.

60|$|Next {{came the}} job of lassoing the monster's tail. Here I shone, for I had lassoed mountain-lions with Buffalo Jones, and I was {{efficient}} and quick.

After that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> kind of tackle to hold me up.|$|R
