5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E

Shortly after the start of the battle, Admiral Ruchang's signalling mast aboard Dingyuan was disabled by its own weapons. This meant that the entire Chinese fleet operated in these pairs throughout the battle without any central organisation.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system's test runs.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg Airport, officially {{opened in}} 1938 {{because of the}} success of the cement industry, had in fact {{operated}} flights to Copenhagen since 1936. During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the airport was captured by German paratroopers on the night of the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway. On 13 August 1940, a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, but all of the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes. After the war, the Royal Air Force destroyed all the German facilities including planes, hangars and equipment but left the passenger facilities intact.|$|E

5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most productive periods in Angelou's career; {{she had written}} three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was {{best known for her}} seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E
5|$|Blitzball {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of}} the game <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was less}} {{involved}} with the legislative process than previous governors. For example, he {{did not attempt to}} influence the choice of legislative leadership, while most previous governors had practically hand-selected the presiding officers in each house. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two legislative sessions of his term, he went on vacation. Consequently, many of his legislative recommendations were not enacted. Among his failed proposals were a multi-county banking law, a flat rate income tax, professional negotiations for teachers, and a constitutional amendment to allow a governor to be elected to successive terms. In all, Brown was out of the state – leaving Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor – for more than five hundred days during his four-year term. As noted by Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison, Brown's hands-off approach allowed the legislature to gain power relative to the governor {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history, a trend which continued into the terms of his successors.|$|E
