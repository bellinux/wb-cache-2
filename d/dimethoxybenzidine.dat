40|$|Chemical {{potential}} and hardness of Benzidine, 3, 3 - <b>Dimethoxybenzidine,</b> 3, 3 - Dichlorobenzidine, 2, 2, 5, 5 -Tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5,- Pentachlorobiphenyl, Dibenzofuran and adenine, thymine, guanine, cytocin, uracil, GCWC and ATH are calculated through DFT/ 6 - 31 G(d), B 3 LYP method. It is shown that benzidines act as electron donors whereas polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofuran act as electron acceptors during their interaction with biosystems. Motivation. To {{understand the nature}} of charge transfer between a toxin and a biosystem. Method. Calculation of µ, η, PQη and ∆N for several toxins and NA bases and DNA base pairs using B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) method. Results. Benzidines donate electrons to and PCBs,dibenzofuran accepts electrons from a biological system simulated by NA bases and DNA base pairs Conclusions. Benzidine, 3, 3 - <b>Dimethoxybenzidine</b> and 3, 3 - Dichlorobenzidine are electron donors and 2, 2, 5, 5 - Tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5,- Pentachlorobiphenyl, Dibenzofuran are electron acceptors during their interactions with biosystems. Among the toxins benzidine is the best donor and 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 - PCBP is the best acceptor where as among the bases / base pairs guanine is the best acceptor and uracil is the best donor...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{strongly}} suggested that flavonoids exhibit antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antiallergic, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the mechanism {{is still far}} from clear. In this study, the effect of natural flavonoid compounds, such as green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and rutin on lipoxygenase-mediated co-oxidation of guaiacol, benzi-dine, paraphenylenediamine, and <b>dimethoxybenzidine</b> was inves-tigated. Green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and rutin can reduce the co-oxidation reaction speed of tested com-pounds mediated by soybean lipoxygenase {{and the production of}} oxidative products and free radical intermediates. Their median in-hibition concentrations on guaiacol oxidation mediated by soybean lipoxygenase were 8. 22 mg·L− 1, 17. 8 µmol·L− 1, 41. 5 µmol·L− 1, and 46. 3 µmol·L− 1, respectively. These were all significantly lower than glutathione, dithiothreitol, butylated hydroxyanisole and gossypol. The data collected in this study suggest that flavonoids may have an anticarcinogenicity and antitoxicity effect through inhibition of oxidative activation...|$|E
