5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E

25|$|Changmarín {{used his}} {{writings}} as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged décimas as means {{to educate the}} people about identity and the struggle at hand.

25|$|Centipede {{reproduction}} {{does not}} involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take up. In one clade, this spermatophore is deposited in a web, and the male undertakes a courtship dance to encourage the female to engulf his sperm. In other cases, the males <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> them for the females to find. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer, but in subtropical and tropical areas, little seasonality to centipede breeding is apparent. A few species of parthenogenetic centipedes are known.|$|E

25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{is present}} in Bloodborne as well, though it {{functions}} differently from its counterparts in the Souls series. By activating a non-consumable item {{at the cost of}} one Insight point, players can summon other players into their world to help with boss battles or large groups of enemies, and progress through areas of the game cooperatively. This leaves the player vulnerable to invasions, in which another player may invade the victim's game world and attempt to kill them, unless the player can find and defeat a specific enemy before an enemy player invades. Multiplayer summons are limited by proximity; players can only be summoned within a specific distance of each other to prevent players being summoned too far away to be of any assistance. Players can only summon other players that are around the same level as them to prevent the game from being too difficult, or too easy, for one of the players. What Covenant a player is a part of affects multiplayer as well. Players can summon an NPC to help them in addition to getting help from other players. The NPC serves as an AI companion to the player, that helps defeat enemies. Players can only summon specific NPCs that they have met throughout their journey. Another way players may interact with each other is by leaving notes. A player may leave a tip for defeating a boss, tell the reader where to go, fool the reader by purposely providing incorrect information, or <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> a meaningless message to others. Players may rate a message as 'Fine' or 'Foul', which will indicate to future readers whether the note is useful or untrustworthy.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Greer's casting, Cheryl was {{initially}} intended to merely be a secondary character for Archer, {{and serve as}} a central figure in a proposed pregnancy angle. [...] "It {{was going to be a}} running gag that Archer kept impregnating Malory’s secretaries," [...] remarked Reed, [...] "Whenever it happened, they would gas them with sleeping gas and <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> them on the steps at Bellevue Hospital with no ID or memory of what just happened. But when Judy agreed to do the show, Cheryl became a much more important character." ...|$|E

500|$|Konner and Rosenthal were {{rewriting}} the script even as sets were being constructed. Ari, Helena Bonham Carter's character, was originally a princess. She {{was changed to}} [...] "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening. Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character [...] "was supposed {{to turn into a}} good guy. There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end," [...] Giamatti reflected. [...] "But Tim [...] and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> him as a jerk into the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more mixed or {{negative}}, with many criticizing the negative reveal {{of the feminist}} Lilith House. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV thought that the episode raised more questions than it answered: such as [...] " [...] seem to accept that several rapes were faked, and then Veronica seems to <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> without that question being answered," [...] arguing that the abrupt ending to the scene constituted an out-of-character moment (she should have acted more negatively). In addition, he criticized Bell's performance, commenting [...] "Speaking of Veronica, she seemed like she was on something tonight. Just outright acting silly-odd, dancing around with some pretty lame jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|Vivekananda linked {{morality}} {{with control}} of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it {{the source of his}} physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, [...] "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life– think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Michigan's season-ending {{loss in the}} 2011 Gator Bowl, {{head coach}} Rich Rodriguez was fired and {{replaced}} by Brady Hoke. As Robinson had thrived in Rodriguez's spread offense, the coaching change led to speculation that Robinson may transfer. On January 17, 2011, Robinson ended the speculation when he issued a statement confirming that he would stay at Michigan. [...] In the video statement released by the University of Michigan, Robinson said he seriously considered transferring and noted that Rodriguez {{was one of the}} few coaches willing to give him the chance to play quarterback at the next level. [...] Robinson explained his decision to stay at Michigan: [...] "This is my family. [...] This is my home now. ... I couldn't let it go." [...] He also noted that he talked to his teammates and told them, [...] "'You know, I can't <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> you out there.' I've been around these guys two years and we've bonded and it's like a family here. There's nothing like this." ...|$|E

500|$|Haggis, Forster and Wilson rewrote {{the story}} from scratch. Haggis said he {{completed}} his script {{two hours before the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Forster noted a running theme in his films were emotionally repressed protagonists, and the theme of the picture would be Bond learning to trust after feeling betrayed by Vesper. Forster said he created the Camille character as a strong female counterpart to Bond rather than a casual love interest: she openly shows emotions similar to those which Bond experiences but is unable to express. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to be based around the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. The decision to homage Goldfinger in Fields's death came about as Forster wanted to show oil had replaced gold as the most precious material. The producers rejected Haggis's idea that Vesper Lynd had a child, because [...] "Bond was an orphan... Once he finds the kid, Bond can't <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> the kid." [...] The water supply issue in Bolivia was the main theme of the film, with a story based on the Cochabamba Water Revolt.|$|E
500|$|SCATTOR {{training}} {{was not easy}} for either the trainers or the trainees. Cultural differences and language barriers had to be breached by both. English–Vietnamese dictionaries were used extensively and Vietnamese sailors who spoke even broken English were often pressed into service to help translate the training syllabus for each job on the cutter. Coast Guardsmen that had maintained their cutters with pride could not understand the Vietnamese sailors seeming lack of care about housekeeping chores. Orders dictated that any cutter entering the ACTOV Program had {{to be ready for}} turnover within four months. Often after a return from patrol duties the Vietnamese sailors would <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> the cutter as soon as it reached homeport, leaving maintenance, cleanup, and re-provisioning to the Coast Guardsmen. [...] AWOL rates for Vietnamese sailors often interfered with training schedules as well as patrol operations. Morale of the Coast Guardsmen charged with the training of the replacement Vietnamese crew was often very low and this caused friction between the two parts of the crew. Because of political pressures in the United States to end involvement in the war as soon as possible, the SCATTOR program of {{training was}} accelerated to a 15-week program and eventually an 11-week program. This caused overcrowding on the cutters and further problems with the mixed crews.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{reworking}} of Madonna's older hits like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] gave them a campy, Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor; he added that [...] " [...] help give the disc a cohesive feel even if the live performance, like the album it's hawking, is kind of humorless. That said, as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> the cameras at home." [...] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release.|$|E
