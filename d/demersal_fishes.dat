5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes,</b> including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{makes use of}} the {{fisheries}} survey data collected during the period 1984 - 87 by the multi-purpose research vessel RV Anusandhani {{in the waters of}} Bangladesh, Bay of Bengal. The data consists of twelve survey cruises directed at the shrimp resources (1985 - 87) and nineteen survey cruises directed at the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> resources (1984 - 86). The biomasses for shrimp and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> during the survey period were estimated, along with a detailed analysis of biomass distribution by depth zone and catch rates for important species of shrimp and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species. The <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> and shrimp biomass during the survey period was estimated as 176 160 t and 857 t, respectively. The levels of biomass when compared with 1973 estimates indicate a tremendous decline, by about 90 % for shrimps and 30 % for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish.</b> Population parameters for four species of shrimps (for both males and females) as well as for eight <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species were also estimated. The parameter estimates were validated using available growth and mortality parameter values from the literature, and were in turn used to estimate the mean exploitation rate (E) of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> and shrimp species comprising the trawl catch. Mean E values for shrimp species is at 0. 61 and 0. 57 for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species, indicating over-exploitation of demersal resources in the Bay of Bengal. Exploratory analysis using surplus production modeling of catch and effort data shows that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level for shrimp resources is around 3 500 t, corresponding to a maximum effort level of approximately 6 480 fishing days. Similar analysis for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> catches gave poor correlations between catch rates and fishing effort.

25|$|Cod is {{the common}} name for the genus Gadus of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Gadidae.

25|$|The {{bodies of}} deep water <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> are muscular with well {{developed}} organs. In this {{way they are}} closer to mesopelagic fishes than bathypelagic fishes. In other ways, they are more variable. Photophores are usually absent, eyes and swimbladders range from absent to well developed. They vary in size, and larger species, greater than one metre, are not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Demersal</b> <b>fish</b> are bottom feeders. They can be {{contrasted with}} pelagic fish which live and feed {{away from the}} bottom in the open water column. <b>Demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.|$|R
25|$|Coastal <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> {{are found}} {{on or near}} the seabed of coastal waters between the {{shoreline}} and the edge of the continental shelf, where the shelf drops into the deep ocean. Since the continental shelf is generally less than 200 metres deep, this means that coastal waters are generally epipelagic. The term includes <b>demersal</b> reef <b>fish</b> and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> that inhabit estuaries, inlets and bays.|$|R
25|$|Fish {{that live}} on or in close {{association}} with the sea floor are called <b>demersal</b> <b>fish.</b> This section discusses the coastal <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> that live on the continental shelf, but are living further from the coast and in deeper water than the nearshore fish discussed above.|$|R
25|$|Deep sea {{demersal}} fish are usually long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This {{may be because}} long bodies have long lateral lines. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates. Smell is also important, {{as indicated by the}} rapidity with which {{demersal fish}} find traps baited with bait fish.|$|E
25|$|On the {{continental}} slope, <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, {{since there is}} more habitat diversity. Further out are the abyssal plains. These flat, featureless regions occupy about 40 percent of the ocean floor. They are covered with sediment but largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes {{are more likely to}} associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The {{edge of the}} {{continental}} shelf marks the boundary where the shelf gives way to, and then gradually drops into abyssal depths. This edge marks the boundary between coastal, relatively shallow, benthic habitats, and the deep benthic habitats. Coastal <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> live {{on the bottom of}} inshore waters, such as bays and estuaries, and further out, on the floor of {{the continental}} shelf. Deep water demersal fish live beyond this edge, mostly down the continental slopes and along the continental rises which drop to the abyssal plains. This is the continental margin, constituting about 28% of the total oceanic area. Other deep sea demersal fish can also be found around seamounts and islands.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is the first to}} investigate deepwater <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> distribution and community structure around South Georgia and Shag Rocks. Analysis of catch data from a trawl survey conducted in 2003 indicated that depth and location have a marked influence over <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> community structure in the region. Three distinct, depth-stratified fish assemblages were observed. The <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> assemblage found on the shelf to depths of around 400 m was dominated by nototheniids and was comprised largely of species endemic to the Southern Ocean and Scotia Sea. At the greatest depths sampled (> 600 m) the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> community was dominated by gadiform fishes including members of the Macrouridae and Moridae, many of which are not endemic to the Southern Ocean. From 400 to 600 m there was a transitional zone with <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> representatives of both the shelf and deeper slope communities. Clear geographic differences in the shelf community were apparent with differences observed in community structure between South Georgia and Shag Rocks to depths of around 400 m. These data provide valuable baseline information to aid environmental management decisions and assess potential impacts of rapid ocean warming around South Georgia...|$|R
500|$|During the day, the Japanese {{angelshark}} mostly lies partly {{buried on}} the bottom; its complex color pattern provides camouflage as it ambushes nearby prey.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes,</b> e.g. the striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|E

40|$|This study loolcs at <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> {{food web}} {{interactions}} {{present at the}} Rockall Trough. Rockall Trough lies within Ices division V. This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> population and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of deep-sea stocks.
