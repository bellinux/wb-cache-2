5|$|Expansion of the {{original}} parking facilities <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to meet demand at many stations, since many started with small lots suitable {{for just a few}} dozen cars. The rebuilt stations at Branford, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, and Westbrook have larger lots than the 1990 stations, and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at Branford in June 2011. A 585-space, three-level parking garage is eventually planned for Madison station.|$|E

5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to rule out delirium).|$|E

5|$|The {{distances}} to star clusters {{can be estimated}} by using a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch, and hence their distance from Earth. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of 7,330light-years (2,250parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000light-years (2,900±300parsecs).|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary.</b> Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

25|$|Poisoning is very {{effective}} for small species. However, {{there are some}} disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.|$|E
25|$|Mastering this {{technique}} is imperative when sailing in high winds or in large swell, when uphauling the sail would be difficult or impossible.

25|$|Water in wood {{normally}} {{moves from}} zones of higher to zones of lower moisture content (Walker et al., 1993).

Wood subsequently attains equilibrium with the surrounding air in moisture content.|$|E
25|$|If such {{experiments}} are conducted in moving media (e.g. water, or glass optical fiber), it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>necessary</b> to consider Fresnel's dragging coefficient {{as demonstrated by}} the Fizeau experiment. Although this effect was initially understood as giving evidence of a nearly stationary aether or a partial aether drag it can easily be explained with special relativity by using the velocity composition law.|$|E
25|$|The potent {{effect of}} genetically {{controlled}} innate resistance {{is reflected in}} the probability of survival of young children in malarious environments.

25|$|Also {{known as}} cobalamin, B12 is an {{essential}} vitamin necessary for normal blood formation. It is also important {{for the maintenance of}} neurological function and psychiatric health.

25|$|Aggregating impacts adds up {{the total}} impact {{of climate change}} across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007a, p.76).
