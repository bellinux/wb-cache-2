5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, {{but to me}} it is a medicine. I keep it around and take <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> need it. But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|Distinguishing {{between science}} and non-science is {{referred}} to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis be considered science? How about so-called creation science, the inflationary multiverse hypothesis, or macroeconomics? Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science. [...] However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting. Martin Gardner has argued for the use of a Potter Stewart standard ("I know <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I could just feel <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E
500|$|Featuring tracks such as [...] "Too Much Love Will Kill You" [...] and [...] "Heaven for Everyone", {{the album}} also {{contains}} the song [...] "Mother Love", the last vocal recording Mercury made {{prior to his}} death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he [...] "wasn't feeling that great" [...] and stated, [...] "I will finish <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come back, next time." [...] However, he never made {{it back into the}} studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.|$|E

500|$|Daniels is {{openly gay}} {{and lives in}} south London. He once remarked: [...] "Out? I've never been in." [...] He lives with actor Ian Gelder. They began seeing each other during a 1993 {{production}} of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, {{although he did not}} discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was [...] "cautious about mentioning <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> left drama school, because AIDS was terrifying everyone and there was a huge homophobic backlash". He decided to come out at the age of 24, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of Martin Sherman's Bent.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{sought to}} present his {{characters}} as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. [...] "To arrive at the truth", {{he wrote in the}} preface to Le Lys dans la vallée, [...] "writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters". [...] "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, [...] "were as real to {{him as if he were}} observing them in the outside world". This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde, who said: [...] "One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [...] Lucien de Rubempré.... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> laugh".|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Roth v. United States (1957) that the First Amendment did not protect {{obscenity}}. It also {{ruled that the}} Hicklin test was inappropriate; instead, the Roth test for obscenity was [...] "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". This definition proved hard to apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room {{to determine if they}} should be considered obscene. Justice Potter Stewart, in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), famously stated that, although he could not precisely define pornography, [...] "I know <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see it".|$|E

500|$|Another {{character}} departure was Smalljon Umber, {{played by}} Dean S. Jagger. In an interview, Jagger {{talked about his}} casting: [...] "I prayed for <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> heard I got the part my knees buckled. It was a life-changing moment." [...] Before becoming a professional actor, Jagger dug trenches and worked at a mattress factory to pay his way through acting school and was a professional rollerblader. Ian Whyte also made his last appearance in [...] "Battle of the Bastards" [...] as the giant, Wun Wun; he had played Gregor Clegane during the show's second season. Special-effects supervisor Joe Bauer said about Whyte's casting as Wun Wun, [...] "We wanted a large performer because somebody who would be 14, 15 feet tall would have more weight and mass to move around, and a person who's a normal size would have {{a very difficult time}} pulling that off".|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was about 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that I was feeling <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what {{it was supposed to}} mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E
