5000|$|A {{common use}} of the term [...] "air gap" [...] in home {{plumbing}} refers to a fixture that provides back-flow prevention for an installed dishwasher. This [...] "air gap" [...] is seen above the countertop as a small cylindrical fixture mounted parallel with the faucet. Below the countertop, the drain pipe of the dishwasher feeds the [...] "top" [...] of the air gap, and the [...] "bottom" [...] of the air gap is plumbed into the sink <b>drain</b> below the <b>basket,</b> or into a garbage disposal unit. When installed and maintained properly, the air gap works as described above, and prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher, possibly contaminating dishes. Water flowing from the fixture into the sink indicates a need for maintenance or repair.|$|R
