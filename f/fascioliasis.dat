25|$|Fasciolosis (also {{known as}} <b>fascioliasis,</b> fasciolasis, {{distomatosis}} and liver rot) is a parasitic worm infection {{caused by the}} common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica {{as well as by}} Fasciola gigantica. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.|$|E

The disease caused by the fluke is called fasciolosis or <b>fascioliasis,</b> which is a type of helminthiasis and has been classified as a neglected tropical disease. Fasciolosis is currently classified as a plant/food-borne trematode infection, often acquired through eating the parasite metacercariae encysted on plants. F. hepatica which is distributed worldwide has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for many years and causes great economic losses to these livestock species, up to £23 million in the UK alone. Because of its size and economic importance, it {{has been the subject of}} many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species. F. hepatica's closest relative is Fasciola gigantica. These two flukes are sister species; they share many morphological features and can mate with each other.|$|E

We also investigated whether there are significant differences in MDA levels and antioxidant enzymatic activities between acute and chronic <b>fascioliasis.</b> MethodsForty <b>fascioliasis</b> patients who were diagnosed by ES-ELISA positivity were included in this study. The patients were classified as 18 with acute and 22 with chronic <b>fascioliasis.</b> ResultsIn patients with <b>fascioliasis,</b> levels of MDA were statistically higher and erythrocyte SOD and GPx activities were statistically lower than in healthy controls. MDA levels {{were found to be}} higher in patients with acute <b>fascioliasis</b> than in patients with chronic <b>fascioliasis</b> although MDA levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic <b>fascioliasis</b> than in controls. There was no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} for the antioxidant enzyme activities. ConclusionThe results of this study may indicate that <b>fascioliasis</b> produces specific effects on the antioxidant defense mechanisms due to its inflammatory character. Our results also allow us to suggest that oxidative stress has an important role in the pathogenesis of <b>fascioliasis</b> and the persistence of this oxidative stress can be one of the underlying factors in the pathogenesis of the chronic disease...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe strong {{relationship}} between climate and <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks enables the development of climate-based models to estimate the potential risk of <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks. This work aims to develop a climate-based risk map of <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks in Iran using Ollerenshaw's <b>fascioliasis</b> risk index incorporating geographical information system (GIS). Using this index, a risk map of <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks for the entire country was developed. We determined that the country {{can be divided into}} 4 <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreak risk categories. Class 1, in which the Mt value is less than 100, includes more than 0. 91 of the country's area. The climate in this class is not conducive to <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks in any month. Dryness and low temperature in the wet season (December to April) are the key barriers against <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks in this class. The risk map developed based on climatic factors indicated that only 0. 03 of the country's area, including Gilan province in the northern region of Iran, is highly suitable to <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks during September to January. The Mt value is greater than 500 in this class. Heavy rainfall in the summer and fall, especially in Rasht, Astara and Bandar Anzaly (≥ 1000 mm/year), creates more suitable breeding places for snail intermediate hosts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

Populations of the intermediate host snail (Lymnaea spp.) peak in May and November, while there is a fourfold increase in the rate of human <b>fascioliasis</b> in February compared to that of September.

Rainfall, seasonally analysed in periods of 3 years, indicates that accumulated summer rainfall may be related with the 1988 and 1999 human <b>fascioliasis</b> outbreaks. Although a more detailed picture, based on the analysis of further abiotic and biotic factors influencing <b>fascioliasis</b> transmission in this area, is required to substantiate this hypothesis, our results serve as the first step of a geographical information system project concerning the epidemiological study of <b>fascioliasis</b> in Iran.

40|$|The {{epidemiological}} {{picture of}} human <b>fascioliasis</b> {{has changed in}} recent years. The number of reports of humans infected with Fasciola hepatica has increased significantly since 1980 and several geographical areas {{have been described as}} endemic for the disease in humans, with prevalence and intensity ranging from low to very high. High prevalence of <b>fascioliasis</b> in humans does not necessarily occur in areas where <b>fascioliasis</b> is a major veterinary problem. Human <b>fascioliasis</b> can no longer be considered merely as a secondary zoonotic disease but must be considered to be an important human parasitic disease. Accordingly, we present in this article a proposed new classification for the epidemiology of human <b>fascioliasis.</b> The following situations are distinguished: imported cases; autochthonous, isolated, nonconstant cases; hypo-, meso-, hyper-, and holoendemics; epidemics in areas where <b>fascioliasis</b> is endemic in animals but not humans; and epidemics in human endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human <b>fascioliasis</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in many countries, including Iran. Various techniques have been evaluated for diagnosis of human <b>fascioliasis</b> using different antigens. We evaluated Fasciola gigantica partially purified fraction antigen (PPF) isolated from sheep&#x 2032;s liver fluke for the diagnosis of human <b>fascioliasis.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-one sera were collected from 104 patients living in an area endemic for human <b>fascioliasis,</b> from 89 non-fascioliasis patients living in a non-endemic area, and from 68 healthy individuals. Micro-ELISA was used in the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of Dot-ELISA.

40|$|<b>Fascioliasis</b> (liver fluke) {{is listed}} {{as one of the}} most {{important}} parasitic infections in humans and animals in the developing world, posing a considerable burden to human public and veterinary health globally (Mas-Coma, 2005). In Vietnam, the prevalence of <b>fascioliasis</b> has increased rapidly since the beginning of the 21 st century and it has become a zoonosis of great public health importance, with Central Vietnam being most severely hit by the disease (Trieu, 2011). The rising prevalence of the disease has been reported in all 15 regional provinces of Vietnam, increasing from 1, 500 cases during 2004 - 2005 to 9, 985 cases in 2011 (Nguyen, 2011). To date, comprehensive strategies for <b>fascioliasis</b> control are not in place, and the only control of the disease is reliance on chemotherapy with triclabendazole (TCZ), recommended by the WHO as the drug of choice for the treatment of both acute and chronic <b>fascioliasis</b> in humans (WHO, 2007 b). However, TCZ resistance has been reported in animals and in humans (Ortiz, Scarcella, Cerna, Rosales, Cabrera, Guzman, Lamenza and Solana, 2013). Although alternative <b>fascioliasis</b> control measures are recommended elsewhere, no typical example has been proven to be effective in practice (Nithiuthai, Anantaphruti, Waikagul and Gajadhar, 2004; Saba and Korkmaz, 2005). Furthermore, various models of foodborne trematode infection control have been introduced and tested for their effectiveness but none of them are complete and applicable to all situations (Nguyen, Nguyen, Bui and Tran, 2011). In the context of the unavailability of effective control measures of <b>fascioliasis,</b> the study of a broadly-based control model of <b>fascioliasis</b> in Central Vietnam was conducted to address the burden of the disease and promote the community’s health. The model, selectively adapted from the trial control model of <b>fascioliasis</b> by Nguyen et al. (2011) and the intervention model by Molyneux (2006), comprised five main components: vector control, health education, improvement of local health systems, involvement of concerned bodies, and chemotherapy. This study aims to implement and evaluate a broadly-based control model for <b>fascioliasis</b> in a community with high prevalence of <b>fascioliasis</b> in Central Vietnam (1) to determine the seroprevalence of human <b>fascioliasis</b> by laboratory methods prior to the interventions; (2) to describe the risk factors associated with <b>fascioliasis</b> infections by conducting surveys on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP), and undertaking household observations and snail counts; (3) to report on the implementation of a broadly-based control model for <b>fascioliasis</b> infection; (4) to evaluate the effectiveness in reducing the seroprevalence of human <b>fascioliasis</b> of the broadly-based control model, comparing its impact with that of a model of treatment of humans and cattle alone, and to treatment of humans only; and (5) to explore the positive and negative factors that motivate or impede the successful implementation of the broadly-based control model for <b>fascioliasis</b> in Central Vietnam...|$|E
