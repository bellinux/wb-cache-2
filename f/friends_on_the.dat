5|$|Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied {{in school}} and, {{at the age}} of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a {{derelict}} house in Montego Bay with transgender <b>friends.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her <b>friends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not expect her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E
