We show that the principal, when she obtains a private subjective signal about the agent’s performance, may pay <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonuses</b> to provide credible feedback to the agent. Conistent with the often observed compression of ratings, we show that in equilibrium the principal communicates the agent’s interim performance imperfectly, i. e. she does not fully di?erentiate good and bad performance. Furthermore, we show that small rewards can have a large impact on the agent’s effort provided that the principal’s stake in the project is small.

40|$|Key {{indicators}} of managerial performance are frequently subjective, that is, they {{are difficult to}} specify and/or verify for contracting purposes. When a principal must rely on subjective information to create incentives {{for a group of}} agents, <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonus</b> pools are shown to be optimal mechanisms. Despite their optimality, however, <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonus</b> pools entail an additional agency cost relative to the benchmark of optimal contracts based on objective and verifiable information. Our analysis identifies circumstances under which this additional agency cost is small, for example, the subjective information signals are precise, or the number of agents participating in the bonus pool increases. When incentive schemes can be based on both objective and subjective performance indicators, the relative weights to be placed on alternative signals are shown to differ from the ones predicted by models with objective signals only. We also demonstrate that correlation in measurement errors has a different impact on the structure of optimal incentive schemes when the performance indicators are merely subjective.

Using theory from behavioral economics that incorporates preferences for fairness into the manager’s utility function, we predict and demonstrate experimentally that managers’ willingness to incur such a cost increases as the team’s aggregate performance becomes less extreme (i. e., as the team’s aggregate performance becomes a more noisy measure of individual performance). Further, using theory that incorporates preferences for trust reciprocity into the manager’s utility function, we predict and demonstrate experimentally that managers’ willingness to incur the cost will be greater for relatively high vs. relatively low levels of aggregate performance. The study contributes to the existing literature on subjective performance evaluation by identifying how social preferences influence managers’ use of discretion in evaluation processes...|$|R

The data include information on five properties: two indicators of risk; two indicators of distortion; and one indicator of potential manipulation. We find that these properties have important effects on incentive system design. First, firms appear to choose the ?best? performance measure available along these dimensions, and use it for the most important (primary) formula bonus. Second, the properties of this primary performance measure are important determinants of the weight placed on the measure for explicit. Third, firms appear to use other performance measures to balance multitask incentives relative to the primary performance measure. Specifically, we find evidence that second and third bonuses are used to provide better incentives for cooperation and to reduce incentives for manipulation. Fourth, we present evidence that subjectivity, through <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonuses</b> based on subjective performance evaluations, and also through implicit incentives for promotions and other rewards, also appear to play the same roles...|$|R

Central governments may feel the obligation to increase <b>future</b> <b>discretionary</b> grants to profligate lower levels of government (even if they promise not to). This lowers the lower level government’s expected opportunity cost of spending and borrowing, and increases the incentive of lower-level governments to be profligate currently.

40|$|Abstract. Team-based work {{practices}} are ubiquitous, and most organizations collect infor-mation about an individual’s performance from his team-mates through privately reported peer evaluations. We analyze the optimal use of peer evaluations {{in the provision}} of in-centives. We derive the optimal contract in a setting in which the firm pays a <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonus</b> based on a publicly observed team output but may further sharpen incentives by using peer evaluations. The optimal contract illustrates why, when and how should peer evaluations be used. We show that peer evaluations can help sustain relational contracts. Peer evaluations are used when the firm is impatient and the associated surplus destruction is small. Moreover, peer reports affect a worker’s pay only when the public output is the lowest possible and he receives the worst possible peer report. Interestingly, a worker’s re-port does not affect his own pay. Effort incentives cannot be decoupled from truth-telling incentives, and in order to induce both effort and truthful peer reports, it may be optimal to ignore signals that are informative of the worker’s effort. Our results are consistent with compensation policy in many professional services industries such as the financial sector. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of the {{employment}} contract, individual contracts form a major method of restructuring incentives, by connecting as closely as is optimal the information available about employee performance, and the compensation for that performance. Because of differences in {{the quantity and quality of}} information available about the performance of individual employees, the ability of employees to bear risk, and the ability of employees to manipulate evaluation methods, the structural details of individual contracts vary widely, including such mechanisms as [...] "piece rates, share options, <b>discretionary</b> <b>bonuses,</b> promotions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, deferred compensation, and so on." [...] Typically, these mechanisms are used in {{the context of}} different types of employment: salesmen often receive some or all of their remuneration as commission, production workers are usually paid an hourly wage, while office workers are typically paid monthly or semimonthly (and if paid overtime, typically at a higher rate than the hourly rate implied by the salary). The way in which these mechanisms are used is different in the two parts of the economy which Doeringer and Piore called the [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] sectors (see also dual labour market).|$|R
