In December that year, 15 {{members of the}} <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah</b> (JI) militant group were arrested for {{involvement}} in the Singapore embassies attack plot. JI member Mohamed Khalim bin Jaffar was detained in January 2002 (and later released in September 2011), and another 21 members were arrested and detained in August 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah</b> group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah</b> devastated the island province's economy.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{structural}} position of covert (terrorist or criminal) networks. Using the secrecy versus information tradeoff characterization of covert networks it is shown that their network structures {{are generally not}} small-worlds, in contradistinction to many overt social networks. This finding is backed by empirical evidence concerning <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah's</b> Bali bombing and a heroin distribution network in New York. The importance of this finding lies in the strength such a topology provides. Disruption and attack by counterterrorist agencies often focuses on the isolation and capture of highly connected individuals. The remarkable result is that these covert networks are well suited against such targeted attacks {{as shown by the}} resilience properties of secrecy versus information balanced networks. This provides an explanation of the survival of global terrorist networks and food for thought on counterterrorism strategy policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of {{key players in}} a terrorist network can lead to prevention of attacks, due to efficient allocation of surveillance means or isolation of key players in order to destabilize the network. In this paper we introduce a game theoretic approach to identify key players in terrorist networks. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that both the structure of the terrorist network, which usually reflects a communication structure, as well non-network features, which represent individual parameters like financial means or bomb building skills, can be taken into account. The application of our methodology results in rankings of the terrorists in the network. We illustrate our methodology by two case studies: <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah’s</b> Bali bombing and Al Qaeda’s 9 / 11 attack, which has led to new insights in the operational networks responsible for these attacks. ...|$|R

A 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta by <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah</b> resulted in the deaths of nine Indonesians. The following year, Indonesian diplomatic and consular premises in Australia received a number of hoax and threat messages.

2500|$|In Indonesia, {{religious}} conflicts {{have typically}} occurred in Western New Guinea, Maluku (particularly Ambon), and Sulawesi. The presence of Muslims in these traditionally Christian regions {{is in part}} {{a result of the}} transmigrasi program of population re-distribution. Conflicts have often occurred because of the aims of radical Islamist organizations such as Jemaah Islamiah or Laskar Jihad to impose Sharia, with such groups attacking Christians and destroying over 600 churches. In 2005 three Christian girls were beheaded as retaliation for previous Muslim deaths in Christian-Muslim rioting. The men were imprisoned for the murders, including <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah's</b> district ringleader Hasanuddin. On going to jail, Hasanuddin said, [...] "It's not a problem (if I am being sentenced to prison), because this is a part of our struggle." [...] Later in November 2011, another fight between Christians against Muslims happen in Ambon. Radical Islamists allegedly set fire to several Christian houses, forcing the occupants to leave the buildings.|$|R

Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, Ali Ghufron, the brother-in-law of Noordin Mohammed Top was sentenced to death on 1 October.

25|$|In 2002, a {{terrorist}} attack in Kuta, Bali killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured a further 240. <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah,</b> a violent Islamist group, {{claimed responsibility for the}} attack, allegedly in retaliation for Australia's support for East Timorese independence and the War on Terror. A subsequent attack in 2005 resulted in the deaths of a further 20 people, including 15 Indonesians and 4 Australians.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{suspected of}} responsibility for the bombing was <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah,</b> an Islamist group allegedly led by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir.

Another videocassette included Hashim Abas casing American institutions in Singapore for possible attack by <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah</b> in 1999, but was not turned over to Singapore authorities until December 14.

25|$|Various {{members of}} <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah,</b> a violent Islamist group, were convicted in {{relation}} to the bombings, including three individuals who were sentenced to death. The attack involved the detonation of three bombs: a backpack-mounted device carried by a suicide bomber; a large car bomb, both of which were detonated in or near popular nightclubs in Kuta; and a third much smaller device detonated outside the United States consulate in Denpasar, causing only minor damage. An audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in direct retaliation for support of the United States' War on Terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor.|$|E

500|$|On January 5, 2000, Mihdhar {{traveled}} to Kuala Lumpur, where he joined Hazmi, Attash and Yemeni, {{who were all}} arriving from Pakistan. [...] Hamburg cell member Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also at the summit, and Mohammed possibly attended. The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali, the leader of <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah,</b> an Asian al-Qaeda affiliate. [...] During the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit, many key details of the 9/11 attacks may have been arranged. At the time, the attacks plot had an additional component involving hijacking aircraft in Asia, {{as well as in}} the United States. [...] Attash and Yemeni were slated for this part of the plot, however, it was later canceled by Bin Laden for being too difficult to coordinate with United States operations.|$|E
500|$|From 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 {{suspected}} {{criminals in}} response to a spike in the crime rate (see [...] "Petrus Killings"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The Tanjung Priok massacre saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of Borobudur, led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and Abu Bakar Bashir (later leader of <b>Jemaah</b> <b>Islamiyah).</b> Attacks on police by a resurgent Free Aceh Movement in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license (SIUPP) which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.|$|E
