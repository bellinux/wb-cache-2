40|$|CIVINSThe Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) plans, designs, constructs, {{maintains}} {{and repairs}} all buildings and facilities for the U. S. Navy around the world. Building and facility planning, {{maintenance and repair}} are {{the responsibility of the}} NAVFAC public works organizations. Building and facility design and construction are the responsibility of the NAVFAC construction management <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> or ROICCs (Resident Officer In Charge of Construction). The following discussion begins with a brief overview of the U. S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps (CEC), the Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Navy contracting. The ROICC <b>field</b> <b>office</b> is introduced with a description of its staffing, organization and relationship to the Navy public works organization. Consolidation of facilities contracting functions between the ROICC <b>field</b> <b>office</b> and public works leads into a discussion on <b>field</b> <b>office</b> readiness, or the ability of the <b>field</b> <b>office</b> to accomplish its mission. Several <b>field</b> <b>office</b> readiness category measures are presented, but this paper focuses on NAVFAC <b>field</b> <b>office</b> staffing readiness and the staffing algorithms. The staffing algorithm is a set of equations used to determine the number of required <b>field</b> <b>office</b> staff as a function of projected annual facilities contracting work in place. The development of the NAVFAC staffing algorithm is presented with analysis. Staffing data and analysis of all NAVFAC <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> is also presented. The paper concludes finding success in NAVFAC's <b>Field</b> <b>Office</b> Readiness initiatives and closes with recommendations for improvement in <b>field</b> <b>office</b> readiness reporting and a brief look into the future of <b>field</b> <b>office</b> assessment[URL] Navy (U.

50|$|In October 2016, the Trump {{campaign}} had 178 <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> compared to Clinton's 489. The Trump campaign's number of <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> lagged far behind those Romney and Obama in 2012. Political science research showed that <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> had a modest {{positive effect on}} a candidate's vote share. The Trump campaign was reportedly almost fully reliant on the Republican National Committee for <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> in swing states. As the <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> are organized by state and local Republican parties, {{they may not have}} been strategically located in terms of boosting turnout for the Republican presidential candidate.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Millions of people rely on the services of Social Security Administration (SSA) <b>field</b> <b>offices.</b> In fiscal year 2007, SSA's approximately 1, 300 <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> provided service to about 42 million customers. People use these offices to apply for Social Security cards, apply for retirement and disability benefits, establish direct deposit, {{and a host of}} other services. While customers may conduct their business using SSA's online, telephone, or other service options, many prefer the personalized contact provided in <b>field</b> <b>offices.</b> Over the last several years, staffing reductions have challenged field offices' ability to manage work, while continuing to deliver quality customer service. To assess how <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> are managing these challenges, GAO was asked to determine (1) the effect that reduced staffing levels may be having on <b>field</b> <b>office</b> operations and (2) the challenges that SSA faces in meeting future service delivery needs. This statement is drawn from GAO's ongoing study on <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> for the committee, which is expected to be issued later this year. To conduct this work, GAO interviewed SSA officials in headquarters, and other components, and analyzed various data on SSA's workloads and other data. In commenting on a draft of this testimony, SSA said that GAO understated the connection between staffing stresses from increased work demands and the agency's funding shortfalls. ...|$|R
