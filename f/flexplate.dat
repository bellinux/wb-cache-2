50|$|A {{starter ring}} gear, {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a <b>flexplate</b> or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the starter motor pinion to the flywheel or <b>flexplate</b> to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|E
50|$|November 2006 - Magna Powertrain and Amtek Auto Ltd. sign a 50-50 {{joint venture}} {{agreement}} to establish a manufacturing facility outside of New Delhi, India, for two-piece <b>flexplate</b> assemblies for automotive applications.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flexplate</b> (or flex plate) is a metal disk {{that connects}} the output from an engine to the input of a torque {{converter}} in a car equipped with an automatic transmission. It {{takes the place of}} the flywheel found in a conventional manual transmission setup. The name refers to the ability of the disk to flex across its main axis bending side to side to take up motion in the torque converter as rotational speeds change. Flexplates are generally much thinner and lighter than flywheels due to the smooth coupling action of the torque converter and the elimination of the clutch surface. Like flywheels, flexplates normally handle coupling to the starter motor, via teeth cut along {{the outer edge of the}} plate. These teeth give the <b>flexplate</b> a gear-like appearance, in spite of this being a secondary function.|$|E
50|$|A torque {{converter}} {{is a type}} of fluid coupling which transfers rotating power from a prime mover, like an internal combustion engine, to a rotating driven load. The {{torque converter}} normally takes the place of a mechanical clutch in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, allowing the load to be separated from the power source. It is usually located between the engine's <b>flexplate</b> and the transmission.|$|E
50|$|The Roto-Hydramatic did {{not have}} a {{conventional}} fluid coupling or torque converter but had an internal fluid coupling with a torque multiplier. There was no real bell housing; instead, the Roto-Hydramatic had a kind of flange connecting the transmission to the engine. The power flow from the engine crankshaft to the transmission input shaft was connected via a flywheel containing a set of springs to absorb torsional vibrations at the <b>flexplate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The cotton-reel adaptor {{fills the}} gap between the V6 <b>flexplate</b> and starter motor and adapts {{straight}} to sprintcar driveshaft uni-joint. Every other component on the cars are modern sprintcar parts. With the Holden V6 adapter, the driver simply locks the quick-change diff into gear, then flicks an ignition [...] "on" [...] switch and holds down their starter button. The car will then engage the starter motor turning the engine crank and driveline projecting the car forwards, once the cars has cranked to enough speed the engine will fire and the car will be in gear ready to race.|$|E
50|$|The {{starter ring}} gear is most {{commonly}} made by forming a length of square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by gear hobbing and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the starter ring need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at pitch circle diameter is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a <b>flexplate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically a gear pump mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gearset. It draws transmission fluid from a sump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine's <b>flexplate,</b> so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough transmission fluid, but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Early automatic transmissions also had a rear pump for towing purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components.|$|E
5000|$|Corvair Powerglide is a fully {{automatic}}, two-speed, rwd aluminum-cased {{automatic transmission}} mounted {{directly to the}} forward face of the cast iron differential housing. It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the starter ring gear, and a centrifugal fan baffle for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a <b>flexplate</b> inside the engine bellhousing. The selector quadrant is arranged R-N-D-L, or Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Low, with no [...] "Park" [...] (except in Pontiac's 1963 version, redesigned to handle the increased torque of a new V8 engine in Tempest and LeMans, added {{by means of a}} separate lever). Range selection is via dash-mounted selector lever operating a sheathed cable that moves a spool valve range selector in the transmission valve body.|$|E
