5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|In July 1917, Corps {{offices in}} Kiev {{circulated}} {{the first issue}} of a recruitment gazette, România Mare ("Greater Romania"), which became the essential component of its propaganda effort in Russia. It was a new edition of the Bucharest gazette founded by Voicu Nițescu, and, in this new form, was managed by a team of pro-union activists: the Transylvanians Sever Bocu, Ghiță Popp, Iosif Șchiopu and the Bukovinan Filaret Doboș. România Mare was successful, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> between 3,000 and 5,000 copies were published per issue.|$|E

5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost {{than the other two}} heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> the carabiniers-à-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he {{was invited}} to a meeting {{organized}} by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who where invited (Przemysł II, Henry V the Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more outrageous by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III risked their lives and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry V the Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

5|$|Yankovic {{desired to}} release the song on a record label, {{although}} no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores, selling them through consignment deals. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic {{for the sole purpose}} of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> one thousand copies of the Another One Rides the Bus EP were made, today it is considered a very rare record to locate.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers {{brought to}} an end Heinlein's series of {{juvenile}} novels. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The ideology of militarism and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> military veterans {{had the right to}} vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as fascist. This description is disputed, some commentators arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, the Saskatchewan Party's {{aggressive}} {{questioning of}} the provincial NDP government over a bad investment of public funds – SPUDCO – forced cabinet minister Eldon Lautermilch to apologize for misleading the legislature, a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> became apparent once sworn evidence was acquired from a civil lawsuit against the province. The party's MLAs requested a public inquiry.|$|E

25|$|Metzinger's Note sur la peinture {{not only}} {{highlighted}} {{the works of}} Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other, {{but it was also}} a tactical selection that highlighted the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the gallery cubists and the burgeoning salon cubists simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> males sing, {{and only}} males fight, means that females have little value as pets apart from breeding. Chinese keepers feed young home-bred females to birds {{as soon as}} crickets display sexual dimorphism. There is one notable exception: males of Homoeogryllus japonicus (suzumushi or jin zhong) sing only in the {{presence}} of females, so some females are spared to provide company to the males.|$|E
