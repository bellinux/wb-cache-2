5|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> and {{intrinsic}} defects {{can interact}} producing new defect complexes. Such interaction usually occurs if a diamond containing <b>extrinsic</b> defects (impurities) is either plastically deformed or is irradiated and annealed.|$|E
5|$|Variable {{stars have}} {{periodic}} or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or <b>extrinsic</b> properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of <b>extrinsic</b> factors, such as eclipsing binaries, {{as well as}} rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 {{over a period of}} 2.87 days.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or <b>extrinsic</b> substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: <b>extrinsic,</b> relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of <b>extrinsic</b> control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the <b>extrinsic</b> muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including <b>extrinsic</b> (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. <b>Extrinsic</b> control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> {{motivation}} {{refers to}} the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. <b>Extrinsic</b> motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In <b>extrinsic</b> motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually <b>extrinsic</b> motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common <b>extrinsic</b> motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an <b>extrinsic</b> motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also <b>extrinsic</b> incentives.|$|E
25|$|The {{aspect of}} {{motivation}} within a person's personality may predict creativity {{levels in the}} person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest {{as a result of}} personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. <b>Extrinsic</b> motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although <b>extrinsic</b> motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly <b>extrinsic</b> motivation often impedes creativity in people.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{plea of guilty}} was {{procured}} by <b>extrinsic</b> fraud.|$|E
25|$|The eight {{muscles of}} the human tongue are {{classified}} as either intrinsic or <b>extrinsic.</b> The four intrinsic muscles act to change {{the shape of the}} tongue, and are not attached to any bone. The four <b>extrinsic</b> muscles act to change the position of the tongue, and are anchored to bone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of <b>extrinsic</b> sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. <b>Extrinsic</b> sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. <b>Extrinsic</b> sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E
25|$|Conduct {{a hearing}} outside the {{presence}} of the jury to examine evidence <b>extrinsic</b> to the statement.|$|E
25|$|Motivation can {{be divided}} into two {{different}} theories known as intrinsic (internal or inherent) motivation and <b>extrinsic</b> (external) motivation.|$|E
25|$|Where {{defendants}} {{and their}} counsel were induced by false representations to remain {{away from the}} trial under circumstances amounting to <b>extrinsic</b> fraud.|$|E
25|$|Explicit <b>extrinsic</b> {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to {{sometimes}} actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such <b>extrinsic,</b> top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the <b>extrinsic</b> rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{researchers}} {{thought of}} motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by <b>extrinsic</b> purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations. Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfil users' intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general gamification. Even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.|$|E
25|$|The {{genioglossus}} {{is one of}} the paired <b>extrinsic</b> {{muscles of}} the tongue. The genioglossus is the major muscle responsible for protruding (or sticking out) the tongue.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to possessing an intrinsic value, storage {{may also have}} <b>extrinsic</b> value. Intrinsic valuation of storage does not take the cycling ability of high-deliverability storage. The <b>extrinsic</b> valuation {{reflects the fact that}} in such facilities, say salt cavern formations, a proportion of the space can be used more than once, thus increasing value. Such high-deliverability storage facility allows its user to respond to variations in demand/price within a season or during a given day rather than just seasonal variations {{as was the case with}} single cycle facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} causes are injury (acute) and {{degeneration}} (chronic and cumulative), and the mechanisms involved {{can be either}} <b>extrinsic</b> or intrinsic or, probably most commonly, a combination of both.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{tunnel junction}} {{has been proposed}} {{to act as a}} memristor through several potentially complementary mechanisms, both <b>extrinsic</b> (redox reactions, charge trapping/detrapping and electromigration within the barrier) and intrinsic (spin-transfer torque).|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> {{motivation}} {{comes into}} play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external {{to him or her}} (like money or good grades).|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the body}} which play an {{important}} role in performing this asana are: both the intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> muscles of the feet, the quadriceps, the iliopsoas muscles, the piriformis, abdominal wall, and the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|The muscles {{acting on}} the thumb {{can be divided into}} two groups: The <b>extrinsic</b> hand muscles, with their muscle bellies located in the forearm, and the {{intrinsic}} hand muscles, with their muscles bellies located in the hand proper.|$|E
25|$|If {{teachers}} {{decided to}} extrinsically reward productive student behaviors, {{they may find}} it difficult to extricate themselves from that path. Consequently, student dependency on <b>extrinsic</b> rewards represents one of the greatest detractors from their use in the classroom.|$|E
25|$|The three {{elemental}} rotations {{may occur}} either about the axes {{of the original}} coordinate system, which remains motionless (<b>extrinsic</b> rotations), or about the axes of the rotating coordinate system, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation (intrinsic rotations).|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of muscles of the tongue. The four {{intrinsic}} muscles alter {{the shape of the}} tongue and are not attached to bone. The four paired <b>extrinsic</b> muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone.|$|E
25|$|On the dorsal side, {{two long}} <b>extrinsic</b> {{extensor}} muscles are superficial to the intrinsic muscles, and their tendons form the dorsal aponeurosis of the toes. The short intrinsic extensors and the plantar and dorsal interossei radiates into these aponeuroses.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{supply for}} all {{intrinsic}} and <b>extrinsic</b> {{muscles of the}} tongue is supplied by efferent motor nerve fibers from the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), {{with the exception of}} the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).|$|E
25|$|The four <b>extrinsic</b> muscles {{originate}} from bone and {{extend to the}} tongue. They are the genioglossus, the hyoglossus (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus. Their main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion, retraction, and side-to-side movement.|$|E
25|$|Cause, {{the open}} and closed {{approaches}} to rhinoplastic correction resolve: (i) nasal pathologies (diseases intrinsic and diseases <b>extrinsic</b> to the nose); (ii) an unsatisfactory aesthetic appearance (disproportion); (iii) a failed primary rhinoplasty; (iv) an obstructed airway; and (v) congenital nose defects and deformities.|$|E
