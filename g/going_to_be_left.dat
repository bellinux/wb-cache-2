500|$|According to {{lead singer}} Gruff Rhys the track is [...] "a song about gambling" [...] and was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> off Hey Venus! for being [...] "too generic" [...] before Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis persuaded the band to reconsider their decision. Critical {{reaction to the}} track was mixed with some reviewers claiming [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] was [...] "ponderously mature" [...] and [...] "more like the generic pop songs one would find on the radio" [...] while others hailed the track as [...] "classic Furries".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the mass}} {{success of the}} band's self-titled album, author Dick Porter wrote that the {{anticipation}} for a follow up was intense. Prior to its release, drummer Jordison proclaimed: [...] "Wait till you hear our fuckin' next record. It smokes our first album. The shit's twice as technical, three times as heavy." [...] Iowa generally received favorable reviews from music critics. The College Music Journal reviewed it as [...] "brutal, unrelenting, scorching..." [...] Many reviews noted its heavy themes; Alternative Press stated, [...] " [...] like having a plastic bag taped over your head for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag.... is over the top...you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> in stitches." [...] NME {{said that it is}} [...] "Exhilarating, brutal and good." [...] Rolling Stone credited the album for its originality, stating that [...] "nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal." [...] Producer Robinson was also praised for his work on the album; Uncut noted, [...] "The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert." [...] Reviewing for Yahoo, John Mulvey said, [...] "They're an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

She later lamented: [...] "It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people told me that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, because I know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> when I am no longer singing".

Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney.

5|$|During 1191 the {{citizens}} of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had <b>been</b> attempting <b>to</b> secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> freed, he <b>left</b> England and went to France.|$|R

60|$|It was {{immediately}} after this conversation that Mrs. Prime uttered to Mrs. Ray that terrible hint {{about the young}} man; {{and at the same}} time uttered another hint by which she strove to impress upon her mother that Rachel ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept in subordination,--in fact, that the power should not belong to Rachel of choosing whether she would or would not go to Dorcas meetings. In all such matters, according to Dorothea's view of the case, Rachel should do as she was bidden. But then how <b>was</b> Rachel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made <b>to</b> do as she was bidden? How <b>was</b> her sister <b>to</b> enforce her attendance? Obedience in this world depends as frequently on the weakness of him who is governed as on the strength of him who governs. That man who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>left</b> <b>is</b> ordered by you with some voice of command to go to the right. When he hesitates you put more command into your voice, more command into your eyes,--and then he obeys. Mrs. Prime had tried this, but Rachel had not turned to the right. When Mrs. Prime applied for aid to their mother, it was a sign that the power of command was going from herself. After dinner the elder sister made another little futile attempt, and then, when she had again failed, she trudged off with her basket.|$|R

So this one is about the city after armageddon. The burnt out city, the crumbling buildings, the smoke that's still lingering after the fire. You know what I mean? There's only a few people left. How do we pick up the pieces and go on from here? Kind of dramatic. But not entirely impossible at this stage of the game...
