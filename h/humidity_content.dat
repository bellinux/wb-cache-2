Most cave chemistry revolves around calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the primary mineral in limestone and dolomite. It is a slightly soluble mineral whose solubility increases with the introduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is paradoxical in that its solubility decreases as the temperature increases, unlike the vast majority of dissolved solids. This decrease is due to interactions with the carbon dioxide, whose solubility is diminished by elevated temperatures; as the carbon dioxide is released, the calcium carbonate is precipitated.|$|E

Experimental data were reproduced with GAB and BET equations. GAB model fitted better with the adsorption and desorption isotherms than BET model.

50|$|Humidity {{depends on}} water {{vaporization}} and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately {{according to the}} ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the <b>humidity</b> <b>content.</b> This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).|$|E

Remarkable efforts are being made to improve the sensing characteristics of metal-oxide-based sensors operating under such conditions. Having versatile semiconducting properties, SnO 2 is prominently used for gas sensing applications. The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the capability of the Al-doped SnO 2 layer as NO 2 selective gas sensor working at high temperatures under the presence of humidity. Undoped SnO 2 and Al-doped SnO 2 (3 at. % Al) layers were prepared by the radio frequency (r. f.) reactive magnetron sputtering technique, having an average thickness of 2. 5 μm.

The investigated technology consists in the use of ozone generating low-pressure UV mercury lamps, operating at room temperature. Hydrogen sulfide is often found in industrial processes, (e. g.

The validity of these in situ analyses was confirmed by Xray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) observations on tensile loaded specimens. Experimental results demonstrated that relative humidity (RH) conditions influence strongly the damage level and damage mechanisms. Indeed, for specimen with RH = 0 %, damage initiation occurs at significantly higher load level than those in RH = 50 % and RH = 100 % specimens. The higher relative humidity condition also results in higher damage level. Damage chronologies have been proposed as damage initiation {{in the form of}} fiber-matrix debonding occurs at fiber ends and more generally at locations where fibers are close to each other due to the generation of local stress concentration (for all studied RH contents), and first fiber breakages occur (RH = 0 %). These debonded zones further propagate through fiber-matrix interface (for all studied RH contents), and new fiber breakages develop (RH = 0 %). At high relative flexural stress, matrix microcracks appear and grow regardless the RH contents. For RH = 100 %, these microcracks are also accompanied by many matrix deformation bands.
