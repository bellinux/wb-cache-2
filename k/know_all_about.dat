25|$|At her lair, Ingrid {{proceeds}} {{to the next}} part of her plan where she restores the good memories of Emma and Elsa to them while stating {{that they do not}} have it in them to kill her. Anna then arrives with the letter (written by her mother) that revealed the truth of Ingrid and Helga being Elsa and Anna's maternal aunts, while stating that Arendelle deserved to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Ingrid and Helga. Ingrid then begins to attack Anna by choking her to death and manages to knock her down. Upon reading the note, a tearful and repentant Ingrid sees that Anna is right as she touches the memory stone which shows her memories of her sisters and begins to regret her actions. Ingrid then undoes the Spell of Shattered Sight by sacrificing her own life. Before she dies, Ingrid states that Emma has found her family and returns the lost memories of Emma and Elsa to them now that she has her own younger sisters' love. Ingrid then disappears to the afterlife where she is happy to join her beloved little sisters, Helga and Gerda, there.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the MCC tour was to fly the flag, promote cricket {{throughout}} Australia and earn revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing upcountry games against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League and provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. Later in the tour these games would pall for the players, which Freddie Brown would <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> as he was used to play these matches in 1932–33 in order to give the Test players a rest. As a result, he usually rested Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Alec Bedser and allowed the junior players to have some time at the crease. Northam was a small mining town 60 miles inland from Perth, but the mine was played out and the local economy was geared to sheep-raising and the team traveled up after regaining their land legs from their voyage. The town was decorated as if for a fête and the players were well entertained by the locals. Freddie Brown lost the toss (as he was to do in four of the Tests), but the local captain Phillips put him in to bat so that they could entertain the crowd. David Sheppard (117) and Gilbert Parkhouse (86) added 175 for the second wicket as the MCC made 329/5 declared with the local spinner K. Byfield taking 3/68. The Western Australia Country XI crashed to 89/7, but managed to survive the day and earned a draw with 113/7. Although a one-day game this was not a limited overs match and the team would have to be dismissed in order for the MCC to win, but Brown thought this was less important than time spent at the crease and left satisfied.|$|E
500|$|Verity {{earned the}} respect of Bradman, {{generally}} regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he [...] "grew {{more and more to}} respect [...] both as a gentleman and as a player." [...] Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was [...] "one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms". During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: [...] "I think I <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there's no breaking-point with him." ...|$|E

In a comparison of [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] and The X-Files episode [...] "4-D", UGO Networks columnist Alex Zalben wrote that the Fringe episode won [...] "by a landslide. This episode kicked the show into high gear, while '4-D' was The X-Files winding down." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] the seventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "the episode that changed everything... With that, the most hyped show of the 2008-2009 TV season produced a moment that finally earned it buzz."

The review described [...] "Piper Maru" [...] as featuring [...] "a tough and sentimental Scully", noting that [...] "action-packed detective work by Mulder enhance an already crackling scenario." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and wrote positively of the unfolding mythology, noting that the [...] "great thing about [...] "Piper Maru" [...] is that it still belongs to the period of time when the mythology episodes were exposing us to more pieces of the puzzle, fitting in various things that we were meant to incorporate into the whole. This {{is the first time we}} meet the black oil, but it's obvious that others <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode eight out of ten, and complimented the introduction of the black oil, writing [...] "this episode is a good introduction to the black oil virus, providing a bridge from the mythology elements earlier in the season to the larger scope of the conspiracy to be revealed." [...] Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the sixth [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series, describing it as [...] "thrilling", [...] "pacey" [...] and [...] "balanced".|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1951, a young cyclist named Jeffrey O'Brien {{would become}} {{arguably the most}} {{dominant}} champion ever. He joined Gill as a four-time champion from 1951 to 1955. His chance at making that total five {{was interrupted by a}} most unusual race in 1953. The story goes that Cycling Association officials felt O'Brien was too dominant and might affect the sport's development. They planned a stratagem involving four junior riders (under eighteen) who would receive a half-hour headstart on the seniors. O'Brien and the peloton caught all but one, the eventual winner, Clinton Castillo. The incident has become a treasured part of Belizean cycling lore. O'Brien would retire in 1955 and never race again. But a new dynasty was to emerge, featuring a team of cycling brothers, the Miguels. Edward, Arthur, John and Rudy would share 11 of the next 13 Classics between them, though not without some controversy. In 1958, John Miguel's finish with contender Duncan Vernon was ruled a dead heat, the only one in Classic history. In 1961, brother Edward thought he had the race won and raised his hands in the air accordingly, only to be disqualified in favour of Vernon and Arthur Miguel. John won the most titles of the quartet with four, followed by Edward's three, and Arthur and Rudy with two each. Other winners during the period were Clinton Castillo in 1967 and Kenneth Sutherland. In 1971, an international participant won for the first time, Mexico's Pablo Calderon, but he won on the Northern Highway, where Cross Countries have occasionally been held. In 1972, Cayo's Anthony Hutchinson, nicknamed [...] "The Tank", demolished Calderon and the Miguels for his first title on the Western Highway, then repeated in 1973 ahead of Kenrick Halliday, then an unknown. But Belizeans were soon to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> him. (Cycling Association retrospective) ...|$|E
2500|$|Eli Wallach as Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez (known as [...] "The Rat" [...] {{according}} to Blondie): The Ugly, a comical and oafish but cagey and resilient, fast-talking Mexican bandit who is wanted {{by the authorities}} for {{a long list of}} crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. The director originally considered Gian Maria Volontè for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with [...] "natural comic talent". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in How the West Was Won (1962), in particular, his performance in [...] "The Railroads" [...] scene. In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was skeptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from For a Few Dollars More, Wallach said: [...] "When do you want me?" [...] The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, [...] "Tuco {{is the only one of}} the trio the audience gets to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint's and Lee's characters remain mysteries." [...] In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to [...] "The Good , the Ugly , the Bad [...] ".|$|E
