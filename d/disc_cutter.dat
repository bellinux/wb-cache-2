50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure Balance Machines are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide <b>disc</b> <b>cutters,</b> drag picks and/or hard rock <b>disc</b> <b>cutters.</b> The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of rock fragmentation underneath <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> {{is not fully}} understood although a number of experimental and numerical investigations {{have been carried out}} in this field. Linear elastic fracture mechanics is widely applied for the analysis of crack problems in rock mechanics. In this study, the higher order displacement discontinuity method is modified for the analysis of crack problems using the cubic variations of displacement discontinuities and three special crack tip elements. It is shown how a new formulation of the indirect boundary element method known as the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) can be used to determine the stress intensity factors of the cracks produced in rocks underneath <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> of tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Crack initiation angles and propagation paths in the rock can also be predicted using this numerical procedure and a mixed mode fracture criterion (for example, the maximum tensile stress criterion). In this numerical approach, three special crack tip elements are used to increase the accuracy of the displacement discontinuities near the crack tips. This method has been used to find approximately the effect of the specific disc parameters (except speed) on the thrust force, the rolling force, and the specific energy. Crack propagation in rocks under <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> is numerically modeled and an optimum ratio of disc spacing to penetration depth of about 10 is obtained, in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results in the literature. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Tubby {{began working}} as a <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> for {{producer}} Duke Reid in 1968. Reid, {{one of the major}} figures in early Jamaican music alongside rival Clement [...] "Coxsone" [...] Dodd, ran Treasure Isle studios, one of Jamaica's first independent production houses, and was a key producer of ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae recordings. Before dub, most Jamaican 45s featured an instrumental version of the main song on the flipside, which was called the [...] "version". When Tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system MCs or toasters, Tubby initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on Reid's mixing desk, but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated, reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and primitive early effects units. In time, Tubby began to create wholly new pieces of music by shifting the emphasis in the instrumentals, adding sounds and removing others and adding various special effects, like extreme delays, echoes, reverb and phase effects. Partly due to the popularity of these early remixes, in 1971, Tubby's soundsystem consolidated its position {{as one of the most}} popular in Kingston and Tubby decided to open a studio of his own in Waterhouse in 1971, initially using a 4-track mixer purchased from Byron Lee's Dynamic studio.|$|E

Result: Find a good corresponding relationship between penetration and cutter spacing. At the process of sandstone, if <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> spacing as 54 ~ 55 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest; with the penetration of 10 mm. If <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> spacing as 66 ~ 68. 5 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest with the penetration of 15 mm.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to increase the}} understanding of failure mechanisms of rock drilling and rock cutting methods in general, and rock boring by <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> in particular. The thesis consists of five separate papers. Paper A presents the theoretical elastic stress field of indexed indenters and some laboratory observations. A fracture mechanics calculation of crack length from <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> is described for the first time. Paper B deals with the behavior of crushed material beneath a penetrating tool. A laboratory investigation of the strength of crushed rock is made and the reconsolidation of crushed rock is evaluated. Paper C reports on in-situ indentation test in a scanning electron microscope. The continuous development of cracks is studied. Paper D presents a new theoretical model for side chipping, assuming tensile failure of the rock. The model is tested in the laboratory by full scale disc cutting tests. Paper E deals with energy-absorbing processes in disc cutting. A classification of energy forms is submitted and first order energy forms measured in a full scale disc cutting experiment. The thesis outlines the essential features of the elastic stress field of indexed indenters. Laboratory investigations have verified the existence of subsurface cracks predicted by stress fields. The evolution of such cracks is qualitatively understood. The tensile side chipping model was tested with satisfactory results. In disc cutting practice the process of groove formation should be separated from side chipping. This will result in less formation of unnecessary long cracks, lower energy consumption, better utilization of available torque and thrust, and decreasing vibrations. Future development of cutters should take advantage of long subsurface cracks, possibly resulting in a dramatic increase in capacity. Godkänd; 1982; 20070424 (ysko...|$|R

In order to find out the factors of wear of disc cutters and improve the rock breaking efficiency, a lot of research has been done.

The laws of wear of disc cutters on the cutter head are researched at the process of cutting migmatitic gneiss, and its influence factors are analyzed. The results show that the wear on the edge of <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is serious. The main factor for the wear of disc cutters is its stress from the rocks, and its variance is continual. And wear rate of the disc cutters is proportional to the integrality index of the rocks. With the increase of the amount of wear, the area of contact between a <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> and the rock gets bigger, and their extrusion strength gets lower on the contrary.

The results of an experimental research undertaken at the Waterjet Laboratory of the University of Cagliari on a medium–hard abrasive rock clearly show that a higher removal rate is achieved owing to the weakening action of a jet directed {{on one side of the}} disc, causing deeper penetration. This outcome is interpreted on the basis of the scale formation model, which explains why smaller scales are obtained on the water jet’s side of the groove. Accordingly, it is suggested that the results can be further improved if the jet is directed ahead of the tool along the same path, since, in this way, larger scales can be produced on both sides...|$|R
