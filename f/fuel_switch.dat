Alset Global designed this architecture {{that it can}} be installed in any vehicle with minimum modification to the existing system. The shift between the petrol and the hydrogen is achieved by the software developed by Alset Global. This software controls the ECU of the vehicle and shifts between the petrol and hydrogen fuels. The software ensures that the vehicle's benefits from the hydrogen are at its maximum level without risking the journey to run out of hydrogen or petrol fuels. The main reasoning behind this system is to make drivers comfortable with the range of hydrogen and ensure them that petrol fuel can be supplied to the system at any time.

40|$|The {{iron and}} steel {{industry}} is the second largest user of energy in the world industrial sector and is currently highly dependent on fossil fuels and electricity. Substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy in the {{iron and steel}} industry would make an important contribution to the efforts to reduce emissions of CO 2. However, different approaches to assessing CO 2  emissions from biomass and electricity use generate different results when evaluating how fuel substitution would affect global CO 2  emissions. This study analyses the effects on global CO 2  emissions when substituting liquefied petroleum gas with synthetic natural gas, produced through gasification of wood fuel, as a fuel in reheating furnaces at a scrap-based steel plant. The study shows that the choice of system perspective has a large impact on the results. When wood fuel is considered available for all potential users, a <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> would result in reduced global CO 2  emissions. However, applying a perspective where wood fuel is seen as a limited resource and alternative use of wood fuel is considered, a <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> could in some cases result in increased global CO 2  emissions. As an example, in one of the scenarios studied, a <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> would reduce global CO 2  emissions by 52  ktonnes/year if wood fuel is considered available for all potential users, while seeing wood fuel as a limited resource implies, in the same scenario, increased CO 2  emissions by 70  ktonnes/year. The choice of method for assessing electricity use also affects the results. Funding agencies: Energy Systems programme by Swedish Energy Agency; Goranssonska Fonden</p...|$|E

40|$|In {{parallel}} to Mexico’s major energy reform, the peninsular state of Baja California Sur (BCS) is {{planned to go}} through a <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> from heavy fuel oil to natural gas. This study investigates the impact of the <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> on the costs and emissions of the BCS electricity system as well as if there is an alternative where instead of the <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> more renewable power is being injected. The study is done by modeling different scenarios including the switch to natural gas and alternative scenarios with combinations of diesel, photovoltaics (PVs) and concentrating solar power (CSP). The study also includes interviews with key actors of the system and the energy sector of Mexico and is complemented with literature studies. Results show that the planned <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> will provide a fast reduction of electricity generation costs {{but in the long run}} the solar alternatives have greater potential to lower them even further. Minimum possible emissions of CO 2 equivalents per scenario until 2026 are 384. 94 kg/MWh for natural gas, 96. 83 kg/MWh for PV/diesel and 137. 01 kg/MWh for PV/CSP/diesel systems. However natural gas remains the least expensive investment. The study analyzes the current policies promoting a sustainable electricity system in Mexico and if there is a risk of a lock-in to natural gas in the area. Finally it analyzes what the transformation of the Baja California Sur system, and the challenges for the alternatives, may say about what will happen in the electricity system of the rest of the country. At the moment the high electricity price in Baja California Sur is the key motivator for investments in renewables, since they must cover high investment costs. Natural gas fuelled technologies in Baja California Sur, and the entire country, will decrease the marginal price of electricity, due to the lower fuel costs. Nonetheless, by injecting more renewables in the system the marginal price of electricity will decrease even further, attempting against their own profitability. The study shows that if there is no financial mechanisms to aid only renewable power investments, these technologies won’t be able to compete with fossil fuelled technologies classified as clean energy in the new Energy industry law of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This {{dissertation}} addresses three topics on applied microeconomics. First, {{we investigate}} issues of market power and tax incidence in the U. S. brewing industry. Since alcohol consumption can be addictive, we derive a structural econometric model of addiction from a dynamic oligopoly game. This model identifies {{the degree of}} market power in a dynamic setting and allows us {{to test the hypothesis}} that federal tax incidence differs from state excise tax. Results indicate that beer producers have a modest market power and an increase in federal excise tax is more effective to reduce consumption than state excise taxes. Second, we estimate the effect of sulfur dioxide (S 0 ₂) emissions regulations on the productivity growth and opportunity cost of 261 phase I generating units. The Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1990 required units to reduce emissions to 2. 5 pounds per mmBTU fuel input in the phase I period (1995 - 99). We calculate Luenberger productivity indicators using directional technology distance function for 209 units in 1990 - 1999. There is more potential to reduce pure technical inefficiency since it is the main source of inefficiency in phase I period. Productivity declined, hut it i not significantly different from the productivity growth of pre-phase I. So environmental policy is successful to reduce SO₂ emission without sacrificing productivity growth. Opportunity cost declined, but the opportunity cost of scrubber and "other" strategy increase. Third, we estimate the regulatory effect on strategy choice of 257 phase I units using multinomial logit model. We assume behavioral cost is a function of shadow input prices, output, SO₂ emissions and regulatory variables. Results suggest regulation significantly affect choices. Units located in high-sulfur coal states are more likely to choose scrubber, allowance or "other" strategy through shadow capital price effect. Allowance trade and sales restriction negatively affect allowance, scrubber or <b>fuel</b> <b>switch</b> strategy.

We applied the methodology of energy targeting through HEN design (using pinch technology) at several values of mean temperature difference (ΔTmin); where the maximum percentage of energy saving was 37 % for hot and cold utility which directly leads to percentage reduction of gas emission by 29 % for CO 2 and 17 % for SOx. <b>Switching</b> <b>fuel</b> oil to other types of fuel realized gas emission reduction percentage where the maximum reduction established was through natural gas fuel type and reached 54 % for CO 2 and 90 % for SOx.

Hence policy makers wish to facilitate households to switch to more modern fuels. To better understand the potential for policy interventions, an enhanced understanding of household fuel choices {{and the process of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>switching</b> is paramount. The primary aim {{of this paper is to}} perform an exploratory data analysis in order to obtain a set of factors associated with rural households that are using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This is achieved through Random Forest analysis, a statistical technique commonly employed for solving classification problems. In this context, fuel choice defines groups to which households belong, while the random forest modelling is used to determine the importance of the variables on the correct classification. The results from this study can be used for constructing further statistical models, as basis for experimental work as well as for questioning previous models. This study ranks the overall predictive importance of a great number of variables previously used in literature on <b>fuel</b> <b>switching.</b> High importance is given to variables coupled to household wealth and history of income together with various commune level variables such as distance to nearest town. The results indicate that whether households have or will undergo <b>fuel</b> <b>switching</b> can be predicted based on area characteristics associated with rurality together with a history of household income and wealth, and furthermore there appears to be an interaction effect between these characteristics. Current income is unable to fully account for a household's wealth and history of income, which in turn appear to be associated with both the current and future use of LPG.
