5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light <b>gray</b> <b>area</b> is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The writers created Mahone's {{character}} in the second season so {{that there would be}} a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a <b>gray</b> <b>area,</b> shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.|$|E

25|$|The pelage is {{uniform in}} color, but highly variable, ranging from red to golden-brown, dark brown to pale cinnamon, and gray to black. Transitional forms among the {{different}} colorations also exist. It may be marked with spots and stripes. White and black lines run across the cheeks {{and up to the}} top of the head, while the ears are black with a central <b>gray</b> <b>area.</b> Golden cats with leopard-like spots have been found in China, resembling large leopard cats.

It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc. As indicated in these two cases, apoptotic cell death plays a critical role in the formation of sexually dimorphic nucleus, and the apoptotic cell number within SDN negatively correlates with the volume of SDN between different sexes.|$|E

25|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a pale tan to pinkish tan ground color that becomes darker towards the foreline, overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–18 (13.4) crossbands. Characteristically, both the ground color and crossband pattern are pale in A. c. contortrix. These crossbands are light tan to pinkish tan to pale brown in the center, but darker towards the edges. They are about 2 scales wide or less at the midline of the back, but expand to a width of 6–10 scales {{on the sides of the}} body. They do not extend down to the ventral scales. Often, the crossbands are divided at the midline and alternate on either side of the body, with some individuals even having more half bands than complete ones. A series of dark brown spots is also present on the flanks, next to the belly, and are largest and darkest in the spaces between the crossbands. The belly is the same color as the ground color, but may be a little whitish in part. At the base of the tail there are 1–3 (usually 2) brown crossbands followed by a <b>gray</b> <b>area.</b> In juveniles, the pattern on the tail is more distinct: 7–9 crossbands are visible, while the tip is yellow. On the head, the crown is usually unmarked, except for a pair of small dark spots, one near the midline of each parietal scale. A faint postocular stripe is also present; diffuse above and bordered below by a narrow brown edge.|$|E

Because printing of game boards {{was more difficult}} in 1822 than 1843, the term mass market is a <b>gray</b> <b>area.</b> In 1822 reversed etched copper plates were used to print game boards. After the first 2,000 impressions, breaks quickly appeared in lines. Games were so expensive, the people who could afford them did not want game boards they could not read. By 1843, lithography with water color painting was popular. Lithography could easily produce 40,000 perfect impressions.|$|E

500|$|His {{opinions}} {{have also}} proved lasting in fields of commercial law. Law students studying torts often encounter Hand's 1947 decision for United States v. Carroll Towing Co., which gave {{a formula for}} determining liability in cases of negligence. Hand's interpretations of complex Internal Revenue Codes, which he called [...] "a thicket of verbiage", {{have been used as}} guides in the <b>gray</b> <b>area</b> between individual and corporate taxes. In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance, Hand stated in 1947 that [...] "there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible". He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate tax forms for legitimate business reasons. In tax decisions, as in all statutory cases, Hand studied the intent of the original legislation. His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators. Hand's landmark decision in United States v. Aluminum Company of America in 1945 influenced the development of antitrust law. His decisions in patent, copyright, and admiralty cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields.|$|E
500|$|Monáe {{has noted}} that the album's musical {{influences}} encompass [...] "all the things I love, scores for films like Goldfinger mixed with albums like Stevie Wonder’s Music of My Mind and David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust, along with experimental hip hop influences from albums such as Outkast’s Stankonia". Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described her sound as [...] "a unique <b>gray</b> <b>area</b> between neo-soul, funk, and art-rock". Music writer Greg Kot noted that the album [...] "touches on" [...] musical genres such as funk, hip hop, folk, electro-pop, glam rock, big-band jazz, rock and classical music. Conceptually, Kot described the album as [...] "a self-empowerment manifesto couched inside a futuristic 'emotion-picture' about an android’s battle to overcome oppression. The notion of space travel and 'new worlds' becomes a metaphor for breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types – a theme that {{has a long tradition}} in African-American music, from Sun Ra and Parliament-Funkadelic to Cannibal Ox and OutKast". The Atlantics Brentin Mock called The ArchAndroid [...] "unique, forward-looking, and apoplectic... something of a jitterbug between Prince's 1986 movie Under the Cherry Moon and the 1977 Watts movie Killer of Sheep, and Daughters of the Dust". Seth Colter Walls of Newsweek described the album as [...] "rocking in parts like Dirty Mind–era Prince, unfolding in a suite form that recalls Abbey Roads side two, and bumping throughout with the best innovations of contemporary hip-hop".|$|E
500|$|After Rachel and Ross drunkenly {{get married}} while on {{vacation}} in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected {{to the idea of}} having his character Ross divorce her– his third divorce– because he felt that it was taking it [...] "too far." [...] The actor explained that [...] "The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [...] {{to be able to move}} on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." [...] Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten [...] "was for the greater good" [...] because [...] "It was inappropriate." [...] However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either [...] "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." [...] Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends [...] "to become a show about a baby" [...] while [...] "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." [...] According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for [...] "propel the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, [...] "The only thing [...] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," [...] deciding, [...] "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" [...] any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in [...] "a <b>gray</b> <b>area</b> of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s a sense that they might be down the road." [...] Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want.|$|E

40|$|Although almost {{seventy years}} {{has passed since}} Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, the issue of {{collaboration}} still haunts Korea today. Attempts {{to resolve this issue}} have tended to focus attention on the traitorous actions of "collaborators" without considering the <b>gray</b> <b>areas</b> that surround their actions such as the circumstances that influenced the accused to commit their alleged traitorous acts and the intentions that drove their decisions. Helen Kim, as a "new woman" and an educator, valued the necessity of providing education for women. Yet, her efforts to realize this goal, to the contrary, forced her into actions that would later be used to construct a reputation as a Japanese collaborator. Korea's nationalist historiography has a tendency to polarize this issue by categorizing a "collaborator" as either a traitor or a patriot. However, when we {{take a closer look at}} these collaborators' lives, we discover that most collaboration happened in <b>gray</b> <b>areas</b> where it is often difficult to clearly draw a line between treason and collaboration. Helen Kim's case suggests that the issue of collaboration cannot be fully explained by nationalist historiography's framework and we must give attention to these <b>gray</b> <b>areas.</b> Through her story I hope to complicate the issue of collaboration by raising questions that address the <b>gray</b> <b>areas</b> that surround the actions of "collaborators. " In doing so, I hope to challenge the nationalist historiography's propensity to oversimplify this issue and present a more nuanced understanding of it...|$|R
