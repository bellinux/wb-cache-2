40|$|Abstract—The etching error causes serious {{frequency}} drift of a microstrip stepped-impedance resonator (SIR). This paper proposes a novel microstrip quarter-wave SIR structure, which is insensitive to fabrication tolerances. Inserting several ground strips in the low-impedance {{section of the}} resonator keeps the impedance ratio almost constant in spite of inaccurate fabrication. As an additional benefit, the resonator size would be miniaturized because the characteristic impedance of the microstrip line in the low-impedance section is mainly controlled by the signal strips and the inserted ground strips in a coplanar manner. The concepts and characteristics of this modified resonator structure are discussed in detail. The filters constructed by the conventional microstrip SIR were also designed and fabricated at the same frequency band to compare with the proposed ones. Measured results show that each proposed filter has compact size, wide stopband, and high tolerance to fabrication errors. Two four-pole cross-coupled filters were designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility.

The antenna consists of two planar-monopole (PM) antenna elements with microstrip-fed printed {{on one side of}} the substrate and placed perpendicularly to each other to achieve good isolation. To enhance isolation and increase impedance bandwidth, two long protruding ground stubs are added to the ground plane on the other side and a short <b>ground</b> <b>strip</b> is used to connect the ground planes of the two PMs together to form a common ground. Simulation and measurement are used to study the antenna performance in terms of reflection coefficients at the two input ports, coupling between the two input ports, radiation pattern, realized peak gain, efficiency and envelope correlation coefficient for pattern diversity. Results show that the MIMO antenna has an impedance bandwidth of larger than 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz, low mutual coupling of less than- 15 dB, and a low envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0. 2 across the frequency band, making it a good candidate for portable UWB applications. © 2013 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{stripline}} {{structure is}} closed and therefore protected against surrounding EMI {{and it is}} easy to bury in multiplayer structures, which offer higher circuit density. This thesis focuses on the evaluation (and verification via actual structures) of the correct simulation of striplines and, as a new aspect, the advantages of using a dual-stripline. Multiple design methods and electromagnetic simulation systems were tested and properties of these are compared. For a reliable design it is still necessary to use at least two tools, at first a very fast tool having excellent circuit parameter optimization methods and then some electromagnetic simulator, which can be used to the complete the realizable layout. That is, because all the electromagnetic simulators suffer from the same limiting factors, the memory capacity of the computer and the unacceptable calculation time. It has been discovered through modelling that the "cat-eye" shape having many more and larger local inaccuracies at the thinned edge areas of the sintered conductor in LTCC structures increases the conductor losses. Therefore it is important to develop new manufacturing methods capable of producing better-shaped conductors. A combination of broadside coupled parallel connected striplines has been tested both in High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) and LTCC materials. A two-conductor stripline, a dual stripline, raises the power handling capability of a microwave bandpass HTS filter. In addition, it offers the possibility to use a normal metal protection layer at the surface of the superconductor without degradation of electrical properties, thus increasing the power handling capability even more. The dual stripline solution in LTCC would offer some preferable properties in high power filters only. The shape of the ground plane used for trimming the coupling between resonators was also found to have a remarkable influence on the quality factor of the resonator. A quite narrow <b>ground</b> <b>strip</b> can offer a much better quality factor with the same coupling level than a meshed or continuous ground plane, but it requires accurate design and manufacturing methods. It would help to design filters with lower loss in the passband without compromises in the attenuation outside the passband...|$|E
40|$|Design of an imaging {{spectrometer}} for earth observation using freeform mirrors Thomas Peschel 1, Christoph Damm 1, Matthias Beier 1, Andreas Gebhard 1, Stefan Risse 1, Ingo Walter 2, Ilse Sebastian 2, David Krutz 2 1 Fraunhofer Institut für Angewandte Optik und Feinwerktechnik, Jena 2 DLR, Institut für Optische Sensorsysteme, Berlin In 2017 the new hyperspectral DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) will be integrated in the Multi-User-System for Earth Sensing (MUSES) platform / 1 / {{installed on the}} International Space Station (ISS). The DESIS instrument is developed under {{the responsibility of the}} DLR. It will deliver images of the earth with a spatial resolution of 30 m on ground in 235 spectral channels in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 1 µm. As partner of the development team Fraunhofer IOF is responsible for the optical system of the {{imaging spectrometer}}. The optical system is made of two primary components: A compact Three-Mirror-Anastigmat (TMA) telescope images the <b>ground</b> <b>strip</b> under observation onto a slit. The following spectrometer reimages the slit onto the detector and performs the spectral separation using a reflective grating. The whole optical system is realized using metal-based mirrors the surfaces of which are made by Single-Point-Diamond Turning (SPDT). Since the spectral range is in the visible, a post-processing of the surfaces by Nickel plating is necessary. The final surface shape and roughness are realized by a second SPDT step and subsequent Magneto-Rheological Finishing. The TMA provides a focal length of 320 mm and an aperture of F/ 2. 8. Its mechanical design relies on the Duolith-technology of IOF as well as optical and mechanical reference structures on the mirrors / 2 / manufactured in the same SPDT run. This strategy allows for a significantly simplified adjustment of the optical system / 3 /. The spectrometer was designed {{on the basis of the}} so-called Offner scheme. Because of the high aperture of the system a freeform mirror had to be introduced in order to provide a good imaging quality over the whole spectral range. The above optical design requires a grating on a curved surface. Technologies are developed in order to fabricate the grating either by SPDT or, alternatively, by laser lithography. The mechanical design uses light-weight housing elements which wrap the optical path to suppress stray light. An athermal design is provided by using the same metal for mirrors and housing. To provide high adjustment precision, the housing elements carry reference and mounting features made by SPDT as well. This approach allows for a stiff mechanical set-up of the system, which is compatible with the harsh requirements of a space flight. References: 1 	N.
