40|$|The goal of {{this report}} is to show the results we {{achieved}} {{in the field of}} autonomous indoor illuminance measurement. At the beginning of the paper {{the state of the art}} measurement methodology is shown. It is followed by the description of the robotic unit we designed for the purpose of automation of the measurement process. Moreover, the algorithm for measurement process is described in detail. The rest of the paper deals with possible improvements of the robotic platform mainly by adding new sensors and by adding the <b>illuminance</b> <b>vector</b> measurement unit...|$|E
