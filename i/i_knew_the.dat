500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer.

[...] Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was [...] criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|E

[...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E
500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart because I knew what the facts were. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date.

500|$|When {{casting the}} actors {{for the two}} main parts, Carter had {{difficulties}} finding an actor for Scully. When he cast Gillian Anderson for the part, the network wanted to replace her. Carter believed they responded negatively towards the casting because [...] "she didn't have the obvious qualities that network executives have come to associate with hit shows". Calling her a [...] "terrific actress", Carter reacted overall positively towards Anderson's audition saying [...] "she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part". David Duchovny on the other hand, was met with more positive response from the network, Carter even saying he was an [...] "early favorite". William B. Davis, who made his first appearance as the recurring villain The Smoking Man in this episode, had originally auditioned for a larger part in the episode, saying [...] "I auditioned for the senior FBI agent who had three lines. I didn't get that part—I got the part with no lines".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E
500|$|Julius Carry saw great {{potential}} {{in the character of}} Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves, in that [...] "Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in." [...] Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot Independence. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching Army of Darkness. He later told Starlog, [...] "I saw that he would be very good with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> situation would be good." [...] The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler's race was never an issue in the show. [...] According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and [...] "may hew more to the truth than one might think". [...] He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for {{featuring}} the first actual kiss between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The series had featured other brushes with kisses {{between the two}} leads: in the fourth season episode [...] "Small Potatoes", a shapeshifter, disguised as Mulder, nearly kissed Scully; in the 1998 film, the two's [...] "lips brushed slightly before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying bee"; and in the sixth season entry [...] "Triangle", Mulder kissed a Scully-lookalike from the 1930s in a reverie of his. John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans." [...] Shiban noted that the episode's kiss felt like [...] "the logical culmination of their relationship. They had been heading toward the kiss for years". Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked it in a very effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used and everything was slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show. Dick Clark was later hired to come in and create a voice-over bit announcing the year 2000.|$|E

500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that.
