40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a fixture device for the receptacle of insulation displacement connectors having a receive shaft in which the receptacles can be placed and a <b>guide</b> <b>comb</b> for the cable to be laid. According to the invention, the fixture device also has a cutting edge at the receiver shaft for cutting off the cable and a guide element for docking the attachment tool. Furthermore, according to the invention, an ejection mechanism is provided by which the receptacle is ejected from the receiver shaft on termination of the attachment operation of the cable and a lifting movement of the guiding comb is activated, wiping away the cable ends remaining in the <b>guide</b> <b>comb...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{clippers}} can be utilized {{to achieve a}} regular haircut: taper clippers, rotary clippers and outliner/edger clippers. Taper clippers are powered by a linear or pivot motor. The blades are not readily interchangeable. The taper lever allows adjustment of the cutting length within a certain range, usually from #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm) on the fine side to #1 length, 3/32" [...] (2.4 mm) on the coarse side. For longer lengths, clipper guards are attached. The guard will cut at the numbered guard length when the taper lever is in the shortest cutting position. Clipper guards are also known as clipper <b>guide</b> <b>combs.</b> Fade clippers are identical to taper clippers {{with the exception of}} the range of cutting lengths which is entirely within the fine blade range. Most fade clippers cut between #00000 blade length, 1/125" [...] (0.2 mm) and #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm). As with regular taper clippers, clipper guards can be attached for longer cutting lengths.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to give the bees a clear starting point to build comb on each top bar. Some TBH beekeepers fashion their top bars with a V-shaped bottom to <b>guide</b> the <b>comb</b> building. Alternatively, some use a table saw to cut two closely spaced slots along the long axis of each new top bar. Either type of guide, wax line or grooves, gives bees a place {{to hold on to}} with their hooked feet. This allows a substantial [...] "drape" [...] of bees to form, which is the beginning of comb building.|$|R
40|$|Pansharpening {{has been}} an {{important}} tool in remote sensing field, which is a process of providing multispectral images with higher spatial resolution. When dealing with WorldView- 2 satellite imagery having more bands and higher resolution, most existing methods are not effective. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective pansharpening methods <b>combing</b> <b>guided</b> filtering and hyperspherical color transformation (HCT) for WorldView- 2 images. We use panchromatic image as the guidance to further refine the intensity of multispectral data and also to extract the sufficient details from the panchromatic image itself. Moreover, the guided filtering and HCT integrated scheme can inject the extracted details into the multispectral data and the multispectral images can be sharpened all at once with an arbitrary order. The experimental results show that our proposed method can obtain high-quality pansharpened results and outperforms some existing methods...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, quantum cascade lasers {{have emerged}} as mature {{semiconductor}} sources {{of light in the}} terahertz range, the frequency range spanning 1 to 10 THz. Though technological development has pushed their operating temperatures up to 200 Kelvin and their power levels up to Watt-level, they have remained unsuitable for many applications {{as a result of their}} narrow spectral coverage. In particular, spectroscopic and tomographic applications require sources that are both powerful and broadband. Having said that, there is no fundamental reason why quantum cascade lasers should be restricted to narrowband outputs. In fact, they possess gain spectra that are intrinsically broad, and beyond that can even be tailored to cover an octave-spanning range. This thesis explores the development of broadband sources of terahertz radiation based on quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). The chief way this is done is through the development of compact frequency combs based on THz QCLs, which are able to continuously generate milliwatt levels of terahertz power covering a fractional bandwidth of 14 % of their center frequency. These devices operate on principles similar to microresonator-based frequency combs, and make use of the quantum cascade laser's fundamentally large nonlinearity to phase-lock the cavity modes. These devices will enable the development of ultra-compact dual comb spectrometers based on QCLs, and will potentially even act as complete terahertz spectrometers on a chip. This thesis also uses broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to analyze the behavior of THz QCLs. By using QCLs as photoconductive switches, the usual limitations imposed by optical coupling are circumvented, and properties of the laser previously inaccessible can be directly observed. These properties include the gain and absorption of the laser gain medium, the populations of the laser's subbands, and properties of the waveguide like its loss and dispersion. Knowledge of these properties were used to <b>guide</b> frequency <b>comb</b> design, and were also used to inform simulations for designing better lasers. by David Patrick Burghoff. Thesis: Ph.
