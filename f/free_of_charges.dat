50|$|The {{effect of}} {{granting}} this motion meant that Klopfer {{was not completely}} <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges.</b> When a case is normally halted on a prosecutor's motion for nolle prosequi, a judge's approval is required to restart proceedings.

This allowed the prosecutor to restore the case for trial without seeking further permission and {{the statute of limitations}} would not be a barrier to re-instating the prosecution at any time. Klopfer's attorney argued that this was a violation of the right to a speedy trial since it left the charges hanging over Klopfer's head indefinitely.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{status of}} these {{regional}} services {{and its relation}} with the SNS is however not clear, as both the Statute of the SNS and the Basic Law of Health are silent about the SRS, with this last one only vaguely mentioning that the health policy in the autonomous regions is defined and executed by the respective bodies of self-government. The question {{of the status of}} the SRS was raised when a number of SNS hospitals sued the Regional Government of the Azores to force it to pay the costs of the services provided to residents in the Azores who received treatment in those establishments.

5000|$|On May 17, 2017, the {{newspaper}} O Globo published that Batista provided recordings made on March 7, 2017, of a dialog between {{he and the}} Brazilian president Michel Temer, where Batista represents that he was paying for the silence of Eduardo Cunha, who is currently in jail, and former target in the investigation. The news resulted in some protests and calls for Temer's resignation, with the Brazilian stock market also facing a drop. On May 19, 2017, JBS admitted to paying bribes to the three Brazilian presidents Michel Temer, Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, spanning the previous 14 years. All three presidents denied accepting bribes. However, he has material evidence of an audio recording catching president Temer green-lighting the Batistas to pay a monthly allowance to former House Speaker, Eduardo Cunha {{in exchange for his}} silence. JBS told prosecutors they had paid a total of $123 million in bribes to Brazilian politicians in recent years. [...] Also Batista is said to have recorded senator and former presidential candidate Aecio Neves of a centre-right party requesting two million reais in bribes. The federal police filmed the payment to the senator’s cousin. The money was then tracked to a bank account of a company belonging to Zeze Perrella, a PSDB senator from Minas Gerais. To the press the former head of CVM referred to testimony that asserted JBS had bribed 1,829 politicians. Temer alleged JBS doctored the recording of him talking to Joesley Batista to make money from the scandal through trading shares, and accused the Batista of insider trading. JBS denied illegal shares. [...] As a result of this bribes, Batista and JBS allegedly obtained funding from the BNDES of over R$10 billion at below market rates. As compensation for the recordings, the Brazilian Federal Police set Batista, his brother and other directors of JBS S.A. <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges,</b> having to pay a penalty of R$225 million. Joesley Batista decided to move to the USA. The agreement obtained by the Batista brothers is applicable only to their physical persons. The Brazilian authorities are still negotiating the penalty to be applied to J&F, the holding of JBS S.A.. Former negotiations suggest that the penalty will be close to R$11 billion, amount that was refused by JBS holding company. As of May 22, CVM was demanding $3.4 billion from JBS as part of a promised leniency deal, according to the press. In May 2017, JBS retained law firm Baker McKenzie to negotiate possible criminal charges with the United States Department of Justice under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.|$|E
