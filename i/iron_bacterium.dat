However, the traditional techniques for CIP (cleaning in place) are usually ineffective, superficial, halfway, and do not clean or sterilize microbes located in the inner layers of the biofilm. A recent strategy for removing the biofilm in pipes is employing enzymes to clean it in the circulating water system under an optimal condition. However, how to operate and control the whole cleaning process is difficult. Here, we will introduce the strategy of enzyme cleaning to make it more appropriated and effective. • A modification of CIP method is proposed for higher efficiency by using N-acetylmuramide glycanohydrolase as catalysts whose optimal pH and temperature is 10  ±  1 and 45  ±  2  °C, respectively. • The initial efficiency of enzyme cleaning was evaluated by testing the content of ATP in water sample using Clean-Trace™ (3 M Corporation). • Lastly, the terminal water was tested with SLYM-BART™ (HACH Corporation) to find out whether there were biofilm-forming bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Lakretz et al.

50|$|Iron filters {{have been}} used to treat <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria.</b> <b>Iron</b> filters are similar in {{appearance}} and size to conventional water softeners but contain beds of media which have mild oxidizing power.

Several different filter media may be used in these iron filters, including manganese greensand, Birm, MTM, multi-media, sand, and other synthetic materials. In most cases, the higher oxides of manganese produce the desired oxidizing action. Iron filters do have limitations. Since the oxidizing action is relatively mild, it will not work well when organic matter, either combined with the iron or completely separate, is present in the water and <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria</b> will not be killed.

40|$|<b>Iron</b> {{oxidizing}} <b>bacteria</b> play {{an important}} role in the geological redox cycling of iron on earth. The redox change between Fe(II) and Fe(III) can be used for biological energy production [1]. Therefore iron oxidation in the iron rich martian soils may be or may have been microbially mediated. The microbial conversion of iron is considered to be an ancient form of metabolism [2], so it might have evolved on Mars as well. However, to exist in recent martian soils, bacteria must be able to endure dry and cold conditions. Neutrophilic iron oxidizers can be found in various iron rich aquatic environments, where they lead to the precipitation of insoluble ferric hydroxides. Some of these environments fall temporarily dry, what could have led to an adaptation to desiccation by bacteria, existing there. One strategy of <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria</b> to endure drought stress might be the formation of biofilms by excreting Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS). The deposition of iron hydroxides could enable them to endure dry conditions as well. For our experiments, neutrophilic <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> have been isolated from a creek in Bad Salzhausen/Hesse and temporarily drying out pools in Tierra del Fuego. Strains from aquatic environments in the national park "Unteres Odertal" and from water wells in Berlin/Brandenburg are included in the tests as well.

Energy poisons azide, arsenate, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol were evaluated to determine sensitivity to known transport inhibitors. We developed and optimized methods to screen for iron transport inhibitors using a cell-based high-throughput screening platform. These inhibitors may have broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic properties...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{test hole}} cores of {{overburden}} grab {{samples from the}} Bear Creek Study Site of the West Moorhead coal deposit in eastern Montana were received from the U. S. Geological Survey. The samples were visually inspected for evidence of mineralization, which was aided by an accompanying geological log for each core. Each sample was ground prior to its analysis for lead content, pH value, conductivity value, and chemoautotrophic bacteria presence. The mineralization of the core samples was quantitatively different for the strata, with no consistent relation between physical and chemical descriptions. Chemoautotrophic bacteria, both sulfur and <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria,</b> were isolated {{from a number of}} core samples. Difficulty was encountered in obtaining pure cultures of these bacteria. Growth was not enhanced when yeast extract, cysteine, glutathione or IM-MF additives were included. The fastidiousness of these cultures does not typify sulfur or iron oxidizers in general, and therefore is characteristic of these isolates. A culture of <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> was isolated from a revegetation study site from the Colstrip coal deposit in eastern Montana. The growth of this culture was similar to the typical <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacterium,</b> Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. Leaching studies were performed on samples which exhibited a wide range of lead concentrations, p...|$|R
