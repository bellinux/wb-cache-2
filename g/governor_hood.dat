5000|$|The 1998 Florida Gubernatorial Election {{was held}} on November 3, 1998 to {{determine}} the Governor for the State of Florida. Two-term Democratic incumbent Governor Lawton Chiles was term-limited and could not run for re-election. John Ellis [...] "Jeb" [...] Bush, who had previously run for governor in 1994 was the Republican nominee, and incumbent Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> Kenneth <b>Hood</b> [...] "Buddy" [...] MacKay was the Democratic nominee. Bush defeated MacKay by nearly 11% of the vote, and won his first of two terms as governor.|$|R
50|$|The North Borneo Chartered Company {{controlled}} North Borneo in 1881. The mostly British {{employees of}} the company desired for an Anglican church to be established. Initially, laymen were used to conduct religious ceremonies in a detached room in the Colonial Secretary's House and, if present, would take over the service from the highest-ranking government officials, <b>Governor</b> William <b>Hood</b> Treacher. William Burgess Pryer, founder of Sandakan and an active layman himself, already wrote in January 1883 a pleading letter {{to the head of}} the Anglican Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury. During mid-1888, a news reached Sandakan that Reverend William Henry Elton was appointed as a priest for Sandakan.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{of these}} major class action {{lawsuits}} {{may have been}} instrumental in motivating other autobody shops to take action, as {{is evidenced by the}} increasing numbers of cases that are being referred to the A&E Body Shop case in Florida. These cases may also be the impetus for the recent request by Mississippi <b>Governor</b> Jim <b>Hood</b> for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to [...] "investigate allegations that some insurance companies’ are “steering” auto policyholders to certain repair shops and coercing those shops to use inferior replacement parts. In addition, these early cases may have inspired the recent increase of media attention from high-level news sources like CNN, USA Today, and The Insurance Journal ...|$|R

Benning, Georgia {{to be prepared}} to enforce the racial integration of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In a vain attempt to halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James <b>Hood,</b> <b>Governor</b> Wallace stood in front of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. This became known as the [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door".|$|R
2500|$|Spring Hill had been, arguably, Hood's {{best chance}} to isolate and defeat the Union army (Thomas L. Connelly, {{historian}} of the Army of Tennessee, argues {{that the importance of}} Spring Hill has been overblown and that Schofield had three alternative routes to either Franklin or Nashville.) Recriminations for the lost opportunity soon began flying. Rumors circulated about Brown being drunk, but they were never substantiated and he was later elected <b>governor</b> of Tennessee. <b>Hood</b> believed that Cheatham was most responsible, although he also had criticism for two of Cheatham's division commanders, Cleburne and Brown. His official report said, [...] "Major-General Cheatham was ordered to attack the enemy at once vigorously and get possession of the pike, and, although these orders were frequently and earnestly repeated, he made but a feeble and partial attack, failing to reach the point indicated." [...] Historians Thomas L. Connelly, Eric Jacobson, and Wiley Sword have each assigned blame to both Hood and Cheatham.|$|R

Near to the next flight of steps is another Podocarpus macrophyllus planted by Queen Elizabeth II in November 1953.|$|R
5000|$|The Spring Hill {{incident}} was {{an object lesson}} in the breakdown of command responsibility and communication. Hood was partially responsible. He had come to Spring Hill with no plan save to outrace Schofield to Nashville. His absence from the field made him ignorant of several crucial matters. When he finally had learned by midnight that the Rebel line was not facing the pike, he still shunned personal observation, being too confident of Schofield's position. Thomas L.
