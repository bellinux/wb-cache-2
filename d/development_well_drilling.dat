40|$|Nowadays, {{both the}} wind power and shale gas {{industries}} have been developing quickly and receiving significant {{attention in the}} media. Since wind and natural gas are competing sources of electricity generation, in order to guide policy, {{it would be useful}} to have an idea of how many jobs are created by these two competing resources. In this paper, we use a panel econometric model to estimate the historical jobcreating performance of wind versus that of shale oil and gas. The model is estimated using monthly county level data in Texas from 2001 to 2011. We collect data on the historical employment, number of directional/hydraulic fracturing <b>wells</b> <b>drilled,</b> and new wind capacity built in each county each month and then study the relationship between them. Both distributed lag and spatial panel models have been used based on different data dependence assumptions. Despite different estimation methodologies, the results were quite consistent. Both first difference and GMM methods show that shale <b>development</b> and <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> activity have brought strong employment to Texas: 77 short-term jobs or 6. 4 FTE jobs per well.

40|$|In chapter 1, {{we provide}} an {{extensive}} and systematic {{evaluation of the}} relative forecasting performance of several models for the volatility of daily spot crude oil prices. Empirical research over the past decades has uncovered significant gains in forecasting performance of Markov Switching GARCH models over GARCH models for the volatility of financial assets and crude oil futures. We find that, for spot oil price returns, non-switching models perform better in the short run, whereas switching models tend to do better at longer horizons. In chapter 2, I investigate the impact of volatility on firms 2 ̆ 7 irreversible investment decisions using real options theory. Cost incurred in oil drilling is considered sunk cost, thus irreversible. I collect detailed data on onshore, <b>development</b> oil <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> on the North Slope of Alaska from 2003 to 2014. Volatility is modeled by constructing GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH forecasts based on monthly real oil prices, and realized volatility from 5 -minute intraday returns of oil futures prices.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeologyMatthew TottenThe Viola Limestone is a {{prominent}} petroleum reservoir in the Mid-Continent Region, particularly in Oklahoma and Kansas. Coral Coast Petroleum established production from the Viola Ls. in 2011 in their Stephens Ranch lease in Clark County, south-central Kansas. Development of this lease has been hindered by the unpredictable production rates encountered {{in each of}} the subsequent eleven <b>development</b> <b>wells.</b> Infield <b>drilling</b> locations to date were chosen by favorable structural position as determined by 3 D seismic. The best reservoir conditions, however, do not necessarily coincide with structural position. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine whether the ideal porosity and permeability are controlled by depositional environment, diagenetic alterations, or a combination of these factors. Several approaches to solve this question were implemented and utilized, including well log analysis, petrographic inspection of well cuttings and thin sections, and the application of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). An exploration model of the Viola Ls. in this field was developed, where the Viola A and B zones were dolomitized during during marine transgressions by mixing of sea water with other Mg-rich fluids. Reservoir conditions are found where these facies were preserved as paleotopographic highs during a subsequent sea level low-stand.

40|$|The {{successful}} water {{flood of}} the Green River Formation in the Monument Butte unit was analyzed {{in detail in}} the last yearly report. It was shown that primary recovery and the water flood in the unit were typical of oil production from an undersaturated oil reservoir close its bubble point. The reservoir performance of the smaller Travis unit was also analyzed. The Monument Butte unit is currently producing at around 300 barrels per day of oil. Two of the new <b>wells</b> <b>drilled</b> in the unit had zones pressurized by the water flood. The third well produced from pressurized {{as well as from}} zones which were unaffected by the water flood. The water flood response of the Travis unit is slow possibly due to problems of reservoir continuity. Plans for water flooding the Boundary unit were drawn. Core description and Formation Micro Imaging log of well 14 a- 28 provided insight about the important Lower Douglas Creek sandstone. It was determined that this sandstone was extensively fractured and detailed fracture characteristics were obtained through comprehensive interpretation of the FMI log. Reservoir modeling and simulation studies of all the three units were also continued. A larger, more detailed model of the Monument Butte unit was built in order to study the performance of the new <b>development</b> <b>wells</b> being <b>drilled.</b> Three alternate models developed to explain the performance of the Travis flood revealed that intersecting hydraulic fractures may have also provided paths for water channeling observed in this unit. The reservoir characterization activities identified new reservoirs in the Travis unit. Reservoir simulations helped design an injection program in Travis, unit expansion plans on the west and north sides of the Monument Butte until and to evaluate the infill drilling.
