He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget Thomson, the son of <b>J.</b> <b>J.</b> Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays.

Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after <b>J.</b> <b>J.</b> Thomson.|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} {{values in}} Fig.  10 represent lower efficiency {{in using the}} optimized PSO algorithm compared with not using it. According to the results, the <b>J</b> 3, <b>J</b> 4, <b>J</b> 2, <b>J</b> 6, <b>J</b> 7 criteria illustrate positive effects of using algorithm control to control short buildings for both the external excitation zones. On the other hand, for the <b>J</b> 1 and <b>J</b> 5 criteria, not using the PSO algorithm in the installed actuators led to a better performance in the defined criteria. The overall {{results showed that the}} criteria of <b>J</b> 3, <b>J</b> 4, <b>J</b> 6, <b>J</b> 7, <b>J</b> 2 were reduced by 20, 11.11, 5, 5.9 and 5  %, on average, respectively, for all the earthquakes in the short buildings. Furthermore, except for the <b>J</b> 3 criterion, the other performance criteria for the structures with medium heights have better performance in the buildings with optimized actuators compared to those with unoptimized actuators. The <b>J</b> 1, <b>J</b> 2, <b>J</b> 4, <b>J</b> 5, <b>J</b> 6, <b>J</b> 7 criteria led to average reductions of 21.28, 14.66, 15.32, 21.74, 4.99 and 14.99  %, respectively, for the structures with medium heights for both types of external excitation zones. The adopted control algorithm for the tall buildings completely depends on the type of the external excitation zone. All the introduced criteria except <b>J</b> 6 showed a good performance in the structure in which the control algorithm was used in comparison with the case in which no control algorithm was used. Therefore, the <b>J</b> 1, <b>J</b> 2, <b>J</b> 3, <b>J</b> 4, <b>J</b> 5, <b>J</b> 7 criteria were reduced on average by 39.59, 11.21, 1.93, 6.25, 19.23 and 4.39  %, respectively, under all applied earthquakes. By monitoring the input force to each actuator and the uncontrolled base shear, the input force for each actuator to control the buildings is determined.|$|R
