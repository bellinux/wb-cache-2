40|$|Pulmonary artery banding is {{a simple}} palliative {{surgical}} procedure for congenital heart defects with left-to-right shunt or complete mixing and pulmonary over-circulation. Even though indication for pulmonary artery banding has been sensibly reduced, since early reparative surgery has been proved superior to palliation and a staged approach, an increasing support for pulmonary banding has been raised {{in the last two}} decades by new indications such as left ventricular retraining, in the late arterial switch operation for complete transposition of the great arteries or before the double-switch operation in congenitally corrected transposition. Along with the increasing interest raised by the new indications and the consequently more <b>diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of banding, debanding has become an important surgical issue. Debanding is usually performed several months after palliation along with the repair of the cardiac malformations; otherwise, it can be done progressively or partially to further delay surgery and let the patient grow. Occasionally, after pulmonary artery banding, a spontane-ous resolution of the underlying cardiac malformation can occur; however, a debanding procedure is in any case necessary...|$|E
40|$|Moringa oleifera {{seeds are}} a {{promising}} resource {{for food and}} non-food applications, due to their content of monounsaturated fatty acids with a high monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/SFA) ratio, sterols and tocopherols, as well as proteins rich in sulfated amino acids. The rapid growth of Moringa trees in subtropical and tropical areas, even under conditions of prolonged drought, makes this plant a reliable resource to enhance the nutritional status of local populations and, if rationalized cultivation practices are exploited, their economy, given that a biodiesel fuel could be produced from a source not in competition with human food crops. Despite the relatively <b>diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of Moringa seeds and their oil in traditional medicine, no pharmacological activity study has been conducted on humans. Some encouraging evidence, however, justifies new efforts to obtain clear and definitive information on the benefits to human health arising from seed consumption.

From {{the point of view}} of furnishing a botanical support for the study of local "material culture" data was collected through field interviews of 49 informants, most of whom were farmers. Results The taxa cited are 60, belonging to 32 botanical families, of which 18 are employed for agricultural uses and 51 for domestic-handicraft folk uses. Data show a <b>diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of plants for many purposes, both in agricultural (present uses 14 %; past uses 1 %) and for domestic-handicraft use (present uses 40 %; past uses 45 %); most of the latter are now in decline. Conclusion 60 data look uncommon or typical of the places studied. Some domestic-handicraft folk uses are typical of southern Italy (e. g. the use of Ampelodesmos mauritanicus for making ties, ropes, torches, baskets or that of Acer neapolitanum for several uses). Other uses (e. g. that of Inula viscosa and Calamintha nepeta for peculiar brooms, and of Origanum heracleoticum for dyeing wool red) are previously unpublished. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of my {{contribution}} is {{to study the}} role and influence of Fascist censorship in the journalistic articles that Dino Buzzati wrote from tha Italian colonies for the  Corriere della Sera  between 1933 and 1940. The articles are collected in the volume  L’Africa di Buzzati. By placing Buzzati’s work in a precise historical framework and discussing the problem of his ‘orientalism’, the article demonstrates that Buzzati’s work from Africa {{can be read as}} a document of Italian colonialism and that it confirmed, in terms of stereotypes and prejudices, not only the attitude of ‘the West’ towards North African peoples, but also his bias against cultural and social realities which were distant from the ones he was familiar with. In terms of politics and ideology, the texts of  Il Buttafuoco  are difficult to decipher, especially with reference to the problem of racism. Buzzati’s narrative was determined not only by the influence of Fascist censorship but also by his aesthetic choices. In particular, the role of space played by the desert, the preference for anti-heroic figures and the <b>diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of imagination show the complexity of the relationship between Buzzati and political power, but also the originality in the way Buzzati used these figures to build a symbolism around the represented reality.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Quality of life’ {{is a very}} {{frequently}} applied concept nowadays. One may doubt whether everyone has the same connotation in mind while using this expression and why ‘quality of life’ attracts so much attention. Is the idea a very old one {{or is it a}} new and noble value? It is argued here that changes such as in the number of aged people and of chronically disabled people, combined with spectacular developments in medical technology and with a rise in knowledge and assertivity, created an increased awareness of ‘quality of life’ and its interaction with medicine. Moreover, limitations to budgets and technological developments trigger an interest in new arguments. ‘Quality of life’ plays an increasing role in all sorts of medical decisions, be it in policy decisions or in individual clinical decisions, be it formally assessed or implicitly weighted. A number of examples is briefly described to illustrate the very broad and <b>diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of quality of life as a criterion. Subsequently we have tried to operationalize the concept on 4 levels: macro, meso, personal and physical. The macro level applies to the meaning of life in a society; assessments of quality of life play a role, for instance, in discussions on euthanasia and in political decisions on medical investments. Examples of the meso level are the hospital, with its internal processes and its ties {{to the rest of the}} world, but also the patient in his social environment. On the personal level the individual's frames of reference on health, illness, future, pain and hope - both of the patient and the doctor - are being considered. It is argued that legitimation of important decisions, investments and interventions requires measurement of quality of life in an objective way and on different levels. Quantifying quality, however, appears hardly feasible. Therefore ‘quality of life’ is frequently measured at the fourth level only, the level of physical activities. Confining measurement to the measurable induces the question of whether it really is ‘quality of life’ that is being quantified. Still, results from such measurements can be of help in decision making. Who decides in clinical situations and in what way should ‘quality of life’ be involved in decision making? In one solution, perhaps the old fashioned one, the doctor takes all responsibility, possibly from a paternalistic ideal. Conversely, should the doctor behave in a completely non-directive way, full autonomy is given to the patient. We advocate a third way, where mutual respect of patient and doctor may enable open consideration of objective and subjective elements of ‘quality of life’ so as to give it a central place in clinical decisions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a model for use by {{planners}} of migrant education. Attitudes and behaviors of planners and teachers relative to the academic expectations set for migrant students were assessed. The levels of task difficulty, information sources, and feedback mechanisms encouraged by planners and the evaluation standards applied by teachers were investigated. Descriptive analyses were made and reported for data collected from twenty-five teachers and fifty state and local planners attending the Eleventh Annual National Migrant Education Conference. While academic achievement was generally judged to be a priority, half the teachers and over one-third of the planners expressed lower expectations for migrant students than for the general student population. These findings were interpreted as substantiating a need for a model for setting higher academic expectations. Teachers and planners also favored assigning easier tasks for migrant students, a practive revealed in the review of literature as producing unhappiness and shame in the student. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>use</b> of warmth and friendlines was reported by-teachers of migrant students. An exception showed that teachers tended to use warmth and friendliness discriminately for purposes of classroom control. In findings of related research a relationship was established between diffuse warmth and friendliness and low academic achievement. Sources, highly susceptible to the effect of existing expectations and stereotypes were favored. Teachers used multiple sources of information, but relied most on ethnic background and communication from other teachers. Information about student past performance was used more than information comparing migrant students to national or local norms. The following were conclusions of the study: 1. Migrant teachers and planners hold lower expectations for migrant students than for the general population, an attitude found to relate to low academic achievement. 2. Teachers exhibit warmth and friendliness toward migrant students without regard to the quality of performance. Such use of diffuse warmth and friendliness has been found to be directly related to low academic achievement. 3. Teachers and planners rely on past performance, ethnic background, and other teachers for information. All three sources promote a continuation of low expectations. 4. By giving the highest grade or mark available to migrant students regardless of the quality or difficulty of work, teachers lead migrant students to believe their work is outstanding. 5. Migrant students, assigned easy tasks, are thereby subjected to conditions which produce unhappiness as well as limited academic achievement. 6. Migrant students, seldom provided evaluation information based on comparison with others, must rely on non-challenging past experiences in establishing future expectation for self. An interactive model involving teachers indirectly in raising Mexican-American student expectations was designed based on the findings of the study and related research. Components of the model included the existing national math and reading skill lists, a national norm-referenced achievement test or tests, systematic student career goal-setting by parents, systematic academic expectation objective-setting by students, and process evaluation of teacher use of feedback with students. Processes were identified for interstate, intrastate, and intra-project interactions. At each level peer commitments among implementers combined with implementation experiences would result in the use of increasing numbers of information sources. Ultimately teachers, parents, and students supported by local, state and federal planners would set challenging academic expectations for migrant students.

This paper proposes a fast approach for anisotropic diffusion that overcomes spatial size limitations by distributing the diffusion as individual sub-processes over several overlapping sub-images. The overlap areas are synchronized at specific diffusion time ensuring that the fast approximation does not deviate too much from its single process equivalent. The later shall be demonstrated for a medium sized image, which can be <b>diffused</b> <b>using</b> both schemes.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} decompose a field of surface normals (needle-map). A diffusion process is used to model the flow of height information induced by a field of surface normals. The diffusion kernel can be decomposed into eigenmodes, each corresponding to approximately independent modes of variation of the flow. The surface normals can then be <b>diffused</b> <b>using</b> a modified kernel with the same eigenmodes but different coefficients. When used {{as part of a}} surface integration process, this procedure allows choosing the trade-off between local and global influence of each eigenmode in the modified field of surface normals. This graph-spectral method is illustrated with surface normals extracted from a face. Experiments are carried with local affinity functions that convey both the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the surface, and an information-theoretic definition of affinity. ...|$|R
