5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.|$|E
