S. 257 offers an important protection to consumers and responsible creditors, eliminates an incentive to game the bankruptcy system, and encourages responsible lending.

Part III questions whether the Perales Court 2 ̆ 7 s declaration that the SSA is “an [impartial] adjudicator and not... an advocate or adversary” remains empirically valid. Part IV discusses the SSA 2 ̆ 7 s recent assertions of management prerogatives that constrict the decisional independence of the SSA 2 ̆ 7 s Administrative Law Judges (ALJs). Part V questions the Sixth and Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s draconian predictions that physicians will be unwilling to participate in social security proceedings if {{they are required to}} submit to cross-examination.
