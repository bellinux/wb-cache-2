25|$|By {{the time}} of Charles XII's death, the anti-Swedish allies became {{increasingly}} divided on how to fill the power gap {{left behind by the}} defeated and retreating Swedish armies. George I and Frederik IV both coveted hegemony in northern Germany, while August the Strong was concerned about Frederick William I's ambitions on the southeastern Baltic coast. Peter the Great, whose forces were spread all around the Baltic Sea, envisioned hegemony in <b>East</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> and sought to establish naval bases as far west as Mecklenburg. In January 1719, George I, August II and emperor Charles VI concluded a treaty in Vienna aimed at the reduction of Russia's frontiers to the pre-war limits.|$|E
25|$|<b>East</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> saw the {{creation}} of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state. Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.|$|E

500|$|A 2011 {{article on}} the early Western Slavs states that the {{transitional}} period (of relative depopulation) is difficult to evaluate archeologically. Some believe that the Late Antique [...] "Germanic" [...] populations (in Poland late Przeworsk culture and others) abandoned <b>East</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> and were replaced by the Slavs coming from the east, others see the [...] "Germanic" [...] groups as staying and becoming, or already being, Slavs. Current archeology, says the author, [...] "is unable to give a satisfying answer and probably both aspects played a role". In terms of their origin, territorial and linguistic, [...] "Germanic" [...] groups should not be played off against [...] "Slavs", as our current understanding of the terms may have limited relevance to the complex realities of the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages. Local languages in the region cannot be identified by archeological studies, and genetic evaluation of cremation burial remains has not been possible.|$|E

500|$|The {{combination}} {{of the effects of}} the Holocaust and postwar antisemitism led to a dramatic mass emigration of Polish Jewry in the immediate postwar years. Of the estimated 240,000 Jews in Poland in 1946 (of whom 136,000 were refugees from the Soviet Union, most on their way to the West), only 90,000 remained a year later. [...] The surviving Jews of Poland found themselves victims of the explosive postwar political situation. The image of the Jew as a threatening outsider took on a new form as antisemitism was now linked to the imposition of communist rule in Poland, including rumors of massive collaboration of Jews with the unpopular new regime and the Soviet Union. Of the fewer than 80,000 Jews who remained in Poland, many had political reasons for doing so. Consequently, – as noted by historian Michael C. Steinlauf – [...] "their group profile ever more closely resembled the Żydokomuna." [...] Regarding this period, Andre Gerrits wrote in his study of Żydokomuna, that even though for the first time in history they had entered the top echelons of power in considerable numbers, [...] "The first post-war decade was a mixed experience for the Jews of <b>East</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe.</b> The new communist order offered unprecedented opportunities as well as unforeseen dangers." ...|$|E
