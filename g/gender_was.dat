5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the Étoile to interview Baret personally.|$|E

25|$|Besides critiquing various {{theatrical}} traditions, {{there are}} gender implications {{in the dispute}} between King Arthur and his wife, Queen Dollallolla over which of the females should have Tom as her own. There are possible parallels between King Arthur and King George, and Queen Dollallolla and Queen Caroline, especially given the popular belief that Caroline influenced George's decision making. The gender roles were further complicated and reversed by the masculine Tom Thumb being portrayed by a female during many of the shows. This reversal allows Fielding to critique the traditional understanding of a hero within tragedy and gender roles in general. Hogarth's frontisepiece reinforces what Fielding is attempting within The Tragedy of Tragedies by having the hero, Tom Thumb, unable to act as the two females take the dominant role and fight amongst themselves. Ultimately, <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> a way to comment on economics, literature, politics, and {{society as a whole}} along with reinforcing the mock-heroic nature of the play.|$|E

The two are confronted by Death Gun, who causes Sinon's PTSD to relapse when his weapon was revealed to be a Type 54 pistol, the same weapon she had used in the post office shooting. She is rescued by Kirito and the two escape, though she is afraid to attack Death Gun. With his help, Sinon overcomes her fear and the two defeat Death Gun. Afterwards, the two end the tournament as co-winners after Sinon kills them both with a «Gift Grenade». Upon exiting GGO, Shino is visited by Shinkawa, who congratulates her on winning the BoB. However, angry at Kirito, he attacks her with intentions of raping and eventually killing her, revealing himself to be Death Gun's creator. Shino manages to resist his attack and escape, but is stopped by Shinkawa before she could exit the house; Kirito arrives and fights Shinkawa, the latter eventually being knocked out by Shino throwing her stereo at him.|$|E

According to the categories and norms in societies, some traits are only associated with women and others only associated with men.

40|$|This essays {{main focus}} will be on {{emergency}} shelters in disasters, and their understanding in gender awareness, by focusing on the way <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed and seen. This dissertation will examine documents from Australian Red Cross and IASC (Inter Agency Standing Committee) in order to explore how they work with gender and shelter related issues. The objective is to examine and with help from these documents see how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed. The method and theory is based on Carol Bacchis; What’s the problem represented to be approach? (WPR-approach). This means that the essay have a discourse analysis basis, which the essay is built on. This was chosen because Bacchis approach interrogates the documents and therefore it is easier to get different views of how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed. Which way it is constructed and what is not constructed as a problem. The main research question is: How is the construction of gender perspective in the documents that are intended to steer the planning of the emergency shelters?   The questions will be; What or which problems seem to represent these documents, regarding gender understanding in emergency shelters? Are there any assumptions behind these formulated problems? If so, what are they? During the review of the documents, is there anything left that is seen as a non-problem, not problematized? Are there any gap or invisibility or can the problem be seen as something else? This essay will show how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed based on power imbalance. The way <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed is complex and difficult. One thing is clear {{and that is that the}} way <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> constructed and how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> represented, matters in emergency shelters. <b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> still also a topic for crisis management to integrate. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze and discuss {{the ways in which}} <b>gender</b> {{identity}} <b>is</b> formed in the child, and how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> generally perceived in society. The formation of the child’s <b>gender</b> identity <b>is</b> examined through the two classic psychoanalysts Robert J.

The examination shows that the <b>gender</b> identity <b>is</b> formed before the sixth year, primarily through postnatal forces, with the most important impact being the parental attitude. Following, the poststructuralist Judith Butler and her deconstructive approach to the question of <b>gender,</b> will <b>be</b> used {{in order to get a}} point of view on how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> perceived in society. In continuation of this analysis, three cases from the recent Danish <b>gender</b> debate will <b>be</b> analyzed with the knowledge gained through Butler, Freud and Stoller, with the purpose of discussing how <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> understood and why the idea of gender neuter seems to be so provocative.

500|$|Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a {{new type}} of female {{character}} with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series.

Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features.

500|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>was</b> a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness {{to play by the}} male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E

During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept.
