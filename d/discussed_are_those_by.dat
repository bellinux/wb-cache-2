The results <b>discussed</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> obtained <b>by</b> the CDF Collaboration from a comprehensive set of single, double, and multigap soft and hard diffraction processes studied during the twenty year period since 1985, when the CDF diffractive program was proposed and the first Blois Workshop was held. Diffractive ¯pp interactions are characterized {{by the presence of}} at least one large rapidity gap, defined as a region of pseudorapidity a devoid of particles. A diffractive rapidity gap, which may be forward (adjacent to a leading nucleon) or central, is presumed to be formed by the exchange of a Pomeron 1, which in QCD is a color singlet quark/gluon object with vacuum quantum numbers. Diffraction {{in which there is a}} high momentum-transfer partonic scattering in the event is referred to as hard diffraction 2, b. In this paper, we briefly review what we have learned about diffraction from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in Run-I (1989 - 1995) of the Tevatron ¯pp collider operating at 1800 GeV c. m. s. energy, and comment on the goals, results already obtained 3, c, and expectations from the 1960 GeV Run-II program, which is currently under way. The CDF results are placed in perspective using a QCD based phenomenological approach, which exploits scaling and factorization properties observed in the data (see Ref. 4). a 1 E+pL We use rapidity, y =, and pseudorapidity, η = − ln tan 2 E−pL θ 2 region of interest the values of these two variables are approximately equal...|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide acquaints the ratite grower with {{management}} techniques {{that can help}} {{reduce the likelihood of}} disease introduction and spread on the farm. Introduction Infectious diseases always concern people who raise animals, including ratite and poultry producers. In general, the larger the number of animals concentrated in a given area, the more potential there is for diseases to occur. This potential is greatly increased if new animals are frequently introduced. Other ways diseases are spread include allowing visitors near the animals, raising multiple ages close to each other or allowing contact with other species. As the ratite industry matures, farms will inevitably become larger and more specialized. This change requires more sophisticated disease prevention techniques to protect the valuable investment each grower has in the operation. The biosecurity measures <b>discussed</b> below <b>are</b> <b>those</b> implemented <b>by</b> the poultry industry which, with some modifications, can be geared toward the unique characteristics of ratite husbandry. In the long run, diseases are far easier and more economical to prevent than to treat...|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{linguistic}} {{signs in}} contexts of use accomplish other functions than pure reference and predication — though {{they often do}} so simultaneously, as though the signs were functioning in multiple analytically distinct semiotic modalities at once. In the philosophical literature, the most widely <b>discussed</b> examples <b>are</b> <b>those</b> identified <b>by</b> J.L. Austin as the performative functions of speech, for instance when a speaker says to an addressee [...] "I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow", and in so saying, in addition to simply making a proposition about a state of affairs, actually enters into a socially constituted type of agreement with the addressee, a wager. Thus, concludes Silverstein, [...] "the problem set for us {{when we consider the}} actual broader uses of language is to describe the total meaning of constituent linguistic signs, only part of which is semantic." [...] This broader study of linguistic signs relative to their general communicative functions is pragmatics, and these broader aspects of the meaning of utterances is pragmatic meaning. (From this point of view, semantic meaning is a special subcategory of pragmatic meaning, that aspect of meaning which contributes to the communicative function of pure reference and predication.).|$|R

Because there was a shortage of available advanced students, I hired two rising sophomore anthropology majors: Elizabeth Stoeger and Solveig (Soli) Gustafson. Because they had not yet been through our methods course, early in the summer we focused on qualitative methods training and on laying the foundation for recruiting study participants. Although Elizabeth and Soli conducted some interviews, the bulk of their research was conducted online and focused on a few questions related to a paper I was planning to give at the American Anthropological Association Meetings in November 2015. Primarily they examined online (e. g., blog, Twitter, other social media) discussions of: a) the communion wafer as a problem for those avoiding gluten, b) how the ‘gluten intolerant’ <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>by</b> <b>those</b> with celiac disease, c) how people with celiac disease respond to jokes mocking gluten intolerance, and d) various vocabulary, particularly ‘glutard,’ as used in social media.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{subculture}} has been criticised {{a great deal}} in recent research on youth and popular music. Two concepts have emerged as offering new ways of conceiving musical collectivities, particularly among young people: scenes, and tribes (or neo-tribes). I offer criticisms of the work of advocates of both terms. I also argue, however, that there is no possibility of a return to the concept of subculture in any adequate sociology of popular music, even if the concept may have some residual use in the sociology of youth. I discuss the potential advantages of the concepts of genre and articulation as a way of at least beginning to address some of the problems raised in the literature on subcultures, scenes and tribes, concerning the politics of musical collectivities. The common feature of the three terms under discussion is that they have <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>by</b> <b>those</b> concerned with the relationship between youth and popular music, and I close by reflecting on the relationship between the study of these two entities. I suggest that the assumption that there is a close relationship between youth and popular music was the result of particular historical circumstances and I argue that, while the study of young people's relationships with popular music remains a topic of interest, the privileging of youth in studies of music has actually become an obstacle to a more fully developed understanding of music and society...|$|R
40|$|While the {{popularity}} of the Arthurian myth among twentieth-century and contemporary women writers is well known, earlier female engagements with the legend have remained largely unexplored. By recovering a number of unexamined texts, this thesis aims to offer a more comprehensive account of the rise of British women writers’ interest in the Arthurian story between 1775 and 1845. Locating women’s engagements with Arthur in Gothic verse, travel writing, topographical poetry, and literary annuals, it argues that differences in the kinds of Arthurian texts available to women writers in the period {{led to the formation of}} a distinct female tradition in Arthurian writing. Works by Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Felicia Hemans <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> alongside <b>those</b> <b>by</b> lesser-known writers such as Anne Bannerman, Anna Jane Vardill, and Louisa Stuart Costello. The initial chapter examines how Arthurian material was bowdlerised and recast for presentation to the female reader in the Romantic period. This provides the context for a new interpretation of various images of anxiety in early Arthurian texts by women as a symptom of their limited, or often second-hand, access to medieval Arthurian works. The following two chapters explore the prevalence of Arthurian material in women’s Gothic verse and travel writing respectively. The fourth chapter investigates the evolution of women’s responses to contemporary Arthurian scholarship, from the popular and satirical through to romance editions of their own. The final chapter turns to Arthurian poems by women in literary annuals, culminating in a comparison of women writers’ treatments of the Maid of Astolat tale and Tennyson’s own. Annual Arthuriana informs and anticipates many of the trends that come to dominate the Arthurian revival in the second half of the nineteenth century, which I identify in conclusion as the moment when the imaginative power of female Arthuriana becomes fully realised...|$|R
40|$|As guest {{editor of}} this special {{issue of the journal}} Estudos Kantianos, I am honored to {{introduce}} the contributions gathered under the general title Kant and the empirical sciences. This monographic number two of the second issue of EK contains twelve articles, writtenby an outstanding international group of Kant scholars who have extensive experience on the questions addressed by the issue, published in five languages (English, Spanish, German, French and Portuguese), meeting the multilingual scope of the journal. The original idea of the monographic issue <b>was</b> to <b>discuss</b> whether Kant’s firm reduction of science, according to the proper sense of this term, to the condition of apodictic certainty could exhaust his concern withthe methodical grounding of science and scientificity. The following excerpt of Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786) displays neatly Kant’s point of view about science as a product of reason: “Only that whose certainty is apodictic can be called science properly; cognition that can contain merely empirical certainty is only improperly called science” (MAN, AA 04 : 468). However, an earlier Kant’s work aiming at defending the Critique of Pure Reason against its early misunderstandings, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783), points out that all empirical research could be subordinated to the legislation of reason, which therefore will shed some doubts on the legitimacy of the preceding severe categorical statement. Kant formulates this suggestion as follows in the Prolegomena (AA 04 : 364) : “whether or notexperience is in this way mediately subordinate to the legislation of reason may <b>be</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>by</b> <b>those</b> who desire to trace the nature of reason even beyond its use in metaphysics, into the general principles of a history of nature; I have represented this task as important, butnot attempted its solution, in the book itself ”. This excerpt encourages the reader to extend the study about the legislative scope of reason beyond the field covered by metaphysics, i. e. descending to the humble bathos where the empirical sciences are cultivated. All the articles of this monographic number attempt to cast light on such a valuable and daunting task that Kantleft without an ultimate solution. ...|$|R

Adota a perspectiva teórico-metodológica da Neurolingüística Discursiva (ND) desenvolvida na UNICAMP por Coudry, desde 1988 e, nesse sentido, parte do princípio de que os sujeitos afásicos, tal como sujeitos não afásicos, realizam trabalho lingüístico-cognitivo/psíquico, cuja expressão nas afasias pode ser entendida como processos alternativos de significação. São apresentados e discutidos alguns dos processos alternativos de significação que SL usa para lidar com a afasia e manter-se sujeito da linguagem. Destaca-se o papel da função poética na emergência de tais processos e na reorganização da linguagem. A análise dos dados, realizada especialmente à luz dos conceitos jakobsonianos, possibilitou refinar conhecimentos acerca dos processos alternativos/criativos de significação; favoreceu a compreensão de como SL afásico lidava com a bipolaridade da linguagem e com os demais processos cognitivos/psíquicos. Além do estudo de caso, esta pesquisa analisa parte da produção teórica e metodológica referente às afasias no âmbito da Neurologia/Neurociência e da Fonoaudiologia, e apresenta a Neurolingüística Discursiva (ND) como uma importante referência aos estudos e às práticas clínicas junto a sujeitos cérebro-lesadosAbstract: This {{research}} {{deals with}} {{an analysis of}} the linguistic-cognitive/psychic facts of an aphasic poet subject (SL).

40|$|Using a qualitatively driven mixed methods design, {{the study}} {{focuses on the}} {{research}} questions how people living with HIV in Germany experience HIV-related stigmatisation and which potential role processes of self-organisation may play in coping with this. Stigmatisation reduces {{the quality of life}} of people living with HIV, impedes their access to medical services, and hampers further successes in HIV prevention. These consequences are part of the study’s outline of the research areas of HIV-related stigmatisation and self-organisation. The outline puts an emphasis on showing conceptual developments and drawing an interpretational framework for the study’s results. The methodological implementation follows the approach of a constructivist Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM, Charmaz, 2014). Within the peer-project positive stimmen (positive voices) quantitative data on experiences of stigmatisation of 1148 people living with HIV was collected. Following a Mixed Methods Design (Morse & Cheek, 2014) peer-researchers involved in the project were interviewed on their experiences in a further step (problem-centred interview, Witzel, 1996). First results of the analysis done with GTM <b>were</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>by</b> <b>those</b> peer-researchers in a focus group designed as a form of member check (Torrance, 2006). Data from the focus group was integrated into the existing frame of analysis or used to extend it. Following an interactive design (Maxwell, 1996) results of the quantitative analysis were merged into the story line of the qualitative results. The integrated results show how both the processes of experiencing stigmatisation and self-organisation can be described by a central phenomenon, namely struggling for space to act in the encounter with an Other. Stigmatisation can present itself in such a way that people experience HIV as strange and as the Other invading their lives, and that their social environment, due to the infection, considers them to be strange and the Other and treats them correspondingly. Consequently people living with HIV may see limited chances to integrate the infection psychologically and socially into their lives and to change HIV’s status as the Other. When engaging in self-help people encounter other people living with HIV and their coping with HIV as the Other. These encounters may initiate processes that support the integration of HIV into their lives. This central concept can be differentiated by six subordinate phenomena: (1) HIV-related caesura permeates space to act, (2) Creating space to act by engagement, (3) Creating space to act in an open encounter with an Other, (4) When common ground creates the Other, (5) Taking a recognized role within HIV-related work, (6) Living with HIV as not self-evident in Aids service organisations. The relevance of these results can be seen on research-related, conceptual, and practical levels: Next to providing an impulse to follow more peer-research designs in studies on those topics, the results broaden the conceptual understanding of processes of experiencing stigmatisation and engaging in self-organisation and their interlinkages. This understanding can contribute to the development of strategies addressing stigmatisation that do not focus on integration and normalization of minorities into the mainstream society but advocate for the appreciation and recognition of differences and diversity – strategies in which self-organisation of people living with HIV plays an important role in coping with and reducing HIV-related stigmatization...|$|R
