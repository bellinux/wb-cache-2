30|$|From the Table  8 and Fig.  12, {{according}} to the simple calculation, the maximal DC transmission real power <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2 can reach 1.2637  p.u. while that only 1.0588  p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1 and 1.0066 p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 3. What’s more, it can be observed from the Figs.  13 – 14, although the total real power of generators, 46.1939  p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2, is larger than that 45.9030  p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1, 46.0223  p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 3, and 45.9133  p.u. <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4, the total cost 65942 $/hr <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2, is lower than that 67152 $/hr <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1, and 71047 $/hr <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4. That also indicates the impacts of variational locations of HVDC transmission line on the OPF results exist again. Besides, the total costs obtained by Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3, are all less than that by Case 4, which justifies the improvement of adding HVDC transmission line to this modified test system over the original system standing from the economic point of view.|$|R

40|$|The author had {{previously}} considered the {{appropriate use of}} error term in the two-factor experimental design. In the present article, the author has considered the three-factor experimental design with repeated measures on one factor. Having decided, for example, that the repeated factor is Factor C, and the non-repeated factors are Factor A and Factor B, there are six cases which are described as follows: Case 1 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all fixed. Case 2 : Factor A and Factor B are both fixed, but Factor C is random. Case 3 : Factor A is random, but Factor B and Factor C are both fixed. Case 4 : Factor A and Factor C are both random, but Factor B is fixed. Case 5 : Factor A and Factor B are both random, but Factor C is fixed. Case 6 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all random. To test {{the significance of the}} main effect of Factor A, MSerror(b) is used as denominator of F ratio <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1 and <b>Case</b> 3; MSab <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 5; and quasi-F ratio, F 1 ´ is used <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2 and Case 4, and F 6 ´ <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 6. To test the significance of Factor B, MSerror(b) is used <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1; MSab <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 3 and Case 5; and quasi-F ratio, F 2 ´ is used <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2, and F 4 ´ <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4 and Case 6. To test the significance of the interaction effect of Factor A and Factor B, MSerror(b) is used <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 1, Case 3, and Case 5; and quasi-F ratio, F 3 ´ is used <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2, Case 4, and Case 6.

30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 3, the thermal inertia of the heating network is intensively applied, which reduces the total heat supply by almost 12 %. The heat production of electric boilers <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4 is 523 GJ, {{less than that}} <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 2. However, Case 4 achieves the lowest wind curtailment, because the combination of electric boilers and thermal inertia <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4 increases the flexibility of CHP units, {{making it possible to}} integrate additional wind power into the grid. Furthermore, although the coal consumption for heating <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4 is higher than that of Case 3, the decrease in coal consumption from the electricity load reduction results <b>in</b> <b>Case</b> 4 featuring the smallest total coal consumption.|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, {{it can be}} {{seen from}} the Fig.  13 that the total cost of each <b>Case</b> is <b>in</b> terms of fuel cost, valve-point cost, and carbon tax cost.
