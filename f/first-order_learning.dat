Introduction Empirical learning is the subfield of AI that develops algorithms for constructing theories from data.

Sherdil pioneered the progress functions study in the field of software development, which, if effectively used, can significantly help reduce the software cost and time and improve product quality. In his research, he found that an average of 22 % autonomous (<b>first-order)</b> <b>learning</b> takes place in all the three fields, productivity, product quality and personal skills. Whereas second-order training and technology seems to have helped software engineers by up to 13 % more in progress, as compared to <b>first-order</b> <b>learning.</b> This thesis presents an external replication of Sherdil's experiment, so as to assess whether his results can be generalizable.

40|$|We {{present a}} new margin-based {{approach}} to <b>first-order</b> rule <b>learning.</b> The approach addresses {{many of the}} prominent challenges in <b>first-order</b> rule <b>learning,</b> such as the computational complexity of optimization and capacity control. Optimizing {{the mean of the}} margin minus its variance, we obtain an algorithm linear in the number of examples and a handle for capacity control based on error bounds. A useful parameter in the optimization problem tunes how evenly the weights are spread among the rules. Moreover, the search strategy for including new rules can be adjusted flexibly, to perform variants of propositionalization or relational learning. The implementation of the system includes plugins for logical queries, graphs and mathematical terms. In extensive experiments, we found that, at least on the most commonly used toxicological datasets, overfitting is hardly an issue. In another batch of experiments, a comparison with margin-based ILP approaches using kernels turns out to be favorable. Finally, an experiment shows how many features are needed by propositionalization and relational learning approaches to reach a certain predictive performance...|$|R

Organizations have used this type of progress behavior in making managerial decisions regarding cost estimating and budgeting, production and labor scheduling, product pricing, etc. This progress was studied in productivity, product-quality and personal skills, in an experiment involving a sample of 12 subjects, who completed one project every week for ten weeks. Second-order training was provided to the subjects through the Personal Software Process, PSP, of Humphrey. A within-subject repeated measure time-series quasi-experimental design was used along with a modified G/Q/M method.

40|$|Abstract. Learning from multi-relational domains {{has gained}} {{increasing}} attention {{over the past few}} years. Inductive logic programming (ILP) systems, which often rely on hill-climbing heuristics in <b>learning</b> <b>first-order</b> concepts, have been a dominating force in the area of multi-relational concept learning. However, hill-climbing heuristics are susceptible to local maxima and plateaus. In this paper, we show how we can exploit the links between objects in multi-relational data to help a <b>first-order</b> rule <b>learning</b> system direct the search by explicitly traversing these links to find paths between variables of interest. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we extend the pathfinding algorithm by Richards and Mooney [12] to make use of mode declarations, which specify the mode of call (input or output) for predicate variables, and (ii) we apply our extended path finding algorithm to saturated bottom clauses, which anchor one end of the search space, allowing us to make use of background knowledge used to build the saturated clause to further direct search. Experimental results on a medium-sized dataset show that path finding allows one to consider interesting clauses that would not easily be found by Aleph. ...|$|R
