40|$|International audienceContext. The blazar PKS 1510 - 089 is {{an example}} of flat {{spectrum}} radio quasars. High-energy emissions from this class of objects are believed to have been produced by <b>IC</b> <b>radiation</b> with seed photons originating from the broad line region. In such a paradigm, a lack of very high-energy emissions is expected because of the Klein-Nishina effect and strong absorption in the broad line region. Recent detection of at least three such blazars by Cherenkov telescopes has forced a revision of our understanding of these objects. Aims. We have aimed to model the observed spectral energy distribution of PKS 1510 - 089 from the high-energy flares in March 2009, during which very high-energy emission were also detected by H. E. S. S. Methods. We have applied the single-zone internal shock scenario to reproduce the multiwavelength spectrum of PKS 1510 - 089. We have followed the evolution of the electrons as they propagate along the jet and emit synchrotron and <b>IC</b> <b>radiation.</b> We have considered two sources of external photons: the dusty torus and the broad line region. We have also examined the effects of the gamma-gamma absorption of the high-energy photons both in the AGN environment (the broad line region and the dusty torus), as well as while traveling over cosmological distances: the extragalactic background light. Results. We have successfully modeled the observed spectrum of PKS 1510 - 089.

40|$|The inverse Compton (IC) {{scattering}} of relativistic electrons {{is one of}} the major gamma-ray production mechanisms in different environments. Often the target photons for the IC scattering are dominated by black (or grey) body radiation. In this case, the precise treatment of the characteristics of <b>IC</b> <b>radiation</b> requires numerical integrations over the Planckian distribution. Formally, analytical integrations are also possible but they result in series of several special functions; this limits the efficiency of usage of these expressions. The aim of this work is the derivation of approximate analytical presentations which would provide adequate accuracy for the calculations of the energy spectra of up-scattered radiation, the rate of electron energy losses, and the mean energy of emitted photons. Such formulae have been obtained by merging the analytical asymptotic limits. The coefficients in these expressions are calculated via the least square fitting of the results of numerical integrations. The simple analytical presentations, obtained for both the isotropic and anisotropic target radiation fields, provide adequate (as good as 1 %) accuracy for broad astrophysical applications.

40|$|Cosmic ray protons {{generate}} gamma-rays, neutrinos, {{and secondary}} electrons and positrons (e+/-) through pion-producing collisions with gas atoms. Any synchrotron or Inverse Compton (<b>IC)</b> <b>radiation</b> from secondary e+/- is therefore accompanied by pionic gamma-rays. Using the extragalactic gamma-ray background, we constrain {{the contribution of}} secondary e+/- to the cosmic radio, X-ray, and soft gamma-ray backgrounds. These bounds depend on the unknown hadronic contribution to the gamma-ray background and the backgrounds' source redshifts. With our assumptions, we find that IC-upscattered light from secondaries is <~ 1 / 4 of the MeV - GeV gamma-ray background and <~ 10 % of the 0. 5 keV - 1 MeV background (for sources at a redshift z <~ 10). The low intensity of the observed gamma-ray background is marginally inconsistent with a secondary e+/- origin for the radio background reported by ARCADE at ~ 3 GHz, unless the magnetic field strength in their sources is milliGauss or greater. These limits on the magnetic field strength are sensitive to uncertainties. However, any contribution to the gamma-ray background from sources {{not responsible for the}} ARCADE excess increases the inconsistency. Comment: Published in ApJL; 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|Massive hot stars produce dense {{ultraviolet}} (UV) photon {{fields in}} their surroundings. If a very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter is located {{close to the}} star, then gamma-rays are absorbed in the stellar photon field, creating secondary (electron-positron) pairs. We study the broadband emission of these secondary pairs in the stellar photon and magnetic fields. Under certain assumptions on the stellar wind and the magnetic field in the surroundings of a massive hot star, we calculate the steady state energy distribution of secondary pairs created {{in the system and}} its radiation from radio to gamma-rays. Under the ambient magnetic field, possibly high enough to suppress electromagnetic (EM) cascading, the energy of secondary pairs is radiated via synchrotron and single IC scattering producing radio-to-gamma-ray radiation. The synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) is hard, peaks around X-ray energies, and becomes softer. The IC SED is hard as well and peaks around 10 GeV, becoming also softer at higher energies due to synchrotron loss dominance. The radio emission from secondary pairs is moderate and detectable as a point-like and/or extended source. In X-rays, the secondary pair synchrotron component may be dominant.

40|$|Down-scaling of {{the supply}} voltage is {{considered}} as {{the most effective means}} of reducing the power- and energy consumption of integrated circuits (ICs). Reduction in the power- and energy consumption is highly beneficial in aerospace and defense applications that have a constrained power budget. These applications include, but are not necessarily limited to, payloads in solar powered spacecraft and rovers. The benefits that can be harvested from reducing the powerand energy consumption in such applications are reduced weight, reduced mass and/or increased functionality for a given power budget. Although supply voltage scaling can improve the energy efficiency of <b>ICs,</b> <b>radiation</b> induced errors also tend to increase with decreasing supply voltage. In order to enable reliable operation in radiation-rich environments, radiation induced errors must be mitigated, preferably with minimum area, power and performance penalties. In this thesis, the single event upset (SEU) dependence on supply voltage scaling is investigated for data flip-flops (DFFs) designed in 90 nm and 65 nm CMOS technology nodes. The radiation tolerance of the DFFs was characterized at supply voltages between 0. 18 V and 1 V, and heavy ion radiation testing was performed using ions with linear energy transfer (LET) between 5 : 8 MeV-cm 2 =mg and 68 : 8 MeV-cm 2 =mg. Both temporal and spatial hardening techniques are utilized as a means of mitigating SEUs, and the impact of drive strength and sensitive node separation is evaluated. The examined circuit-level hardening techniques include triple modular redundancy (TMR), dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) and temporal dual-feedback (TDF), as well as inverter-based and current starved delay elements for SET filtering purposes. This study shows that radiation tolerant DFFs can offer soft error rate (SER) improvements of up to 55 x, 121 x and 600 x, compared to a standard non-radiation tolerant DFF, when scaling the supply voltage down to 0. 18 V, 0. 25 V and 0. 5 V, respectively. Simultaneously, by scaling the supply voltage down to 0. 5 V and 0. 25 V, radiation tolerant DFFs can achieve ~ 3. 9 x and ~ 12 x higher energy efficiency, compared to when operating at a supply voltage of 1 V. Selective placement of high drive strength components showed to reduce the SEU sensitivity in DFFs by up to 112 x, compared to DFFs utilizing standard drive strength. The impact of charge sharing was, on the other hand, increasingly challenging to mitigate with decreasing supply voltage. Nevertheless, based on the findings in this work, radiation tolerant DFFs operated at reduced supply voltage offer a clear advantage over standard non-radiation tolerant DFFs, and may therefore be suited for implementation in low power payloads, depending on the error rate requirements of the application. In addition to investigating the SEU dependence on supply voltage scaling, this thesis also presents the design and performance of subthreshold to above threshold level shifters, and the characterization of the proton beam properties at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory (OCL) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{developed}} direct converting X-ray line detectors offer {{a number}} of advantages in comparison to other X-ray sensor concepts. Direct converting X-ray detectors are based on absorption of X-rays in semiconductor material, {{which leads to a}} generation of charge carriers. By applying high bias voltage charge carriers can be separated and with this the arising current pulse can be assessed by suitable readout integrated circuits (ICs) subsequently. The X-ray absorber itself is implemented as a diode based on GaAs to use it in the reverse direction. It exhibits low dark currents and can therefore be used at room temperatures. The GaAs absorber has a structured top electrode designed on variable bonding and high breakdown voltages. The implemented GaAs absorber exhibits a pixel size of 100 m while the readout IC features fast dead-time-free readout, energy discrimination by two individually adjustable thresholds with 20 bit deep counters and radiation-hard design on chip level. These properties guarantee the application as fast and thus sensitive line detector for imaging processes. Another advantage of the imaging line detector is the cascadability of several sensor modules with 1024 pixels each. This property ensures that the 102. 4 mm long sensor modules can be concatenated virtually with arbitrary length gaplessly.

The model provides a description of the evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of GPS sources with their expansion, predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the X-ray to the gamma-ray frequency domain. Here, we test this model with the broad-band SEDs of a sample of eleven X-ray emitting GPS galaxies with Compact-Symmetric-Object (CSO) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum at frequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for by the FFA mechanism; (ii) the observed X-ray spectra can be interpreted as non-thermal radiation produced via IC scattering of the local radiation fields off the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal, accretion-disk dominated scenario. We also show that the relation between the hydrogen column densities derived from the X-ray (N_H) and radio (N_HI) data of the sources is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if confirmed by future observations, would provide further support to our scenario of high-energy emitting lobes.

40|$|Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXRBs), {{believed}} to be the progenitors of recycled millisecond pulsars (MSPs), occur abundantly in globular clusters (GCs). GCs are therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed observationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the ambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles produce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) processes. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR) frame-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation expected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in 47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period derivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects of pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small errors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict cumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a lower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the <b>IC</b> <b>radiation</b> from 47 Tucanae may be visible for H. E. S. S., depending on the nebular field B as well as the number of MSPs N in the GC. Telescopes such as Chandra and Hubble may find it difficult to test the SR component prediction of diffuse radiation if there are many unresolved sources in the field of view. These results may be rescaled for other GCs where less information is available, assuming universal GC MSP characteristics.

40|$|The BL Lac object Mrk 501 {{went into}} a very high state of {{activity}} during 1997, both in VHE gamma-rays and X-rays. We present here results from observations at energies above 250 GeV carried out between March and October 1997 with the CAT Cerenkov imaging Telescope. The average differential spectrum between 30 GeV and 13 TeV shows significant curvature and is well represented by phi_ 0 * E_TeV^{-(alpha + beta*log 10 (E_TeV)) }, with: phi_ 0 = 5. 19 +/- 0. 13 {stat} +/- 0. 12 {sys-MC} + 1. 66 /- 1. 04 {sys-atm} * 10 ^- 11 /cm^ 2 /s/TeV alpha = 2. 24 +/- 0. 04 {stat} +/- 0. 05 {sys} beta = 0. 50 +/- 0. 07 {stat} (negligible systematics). The TeV spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 clearly peaks in the range 500 GeV- 1 TeV. Investigation of spectral variations shows a significant hardness-intensity correlation with no measurable effect on the curvature. This {{can be described as}} an increase of the peak TeV emission energy with intensity. Simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous CAT VHE gamma-ray and BeppoSAX hard X-ray detections for the highest recorded flare on 16 th April and for lower-activity states of the same period show correlated variability with a higher luminosity in X-rays than in gamma-rays. The observed spectral energy distribution and the correlated variability between X-rays and gamma-rays, both in amplitude and in hardening of spectra, favour a two-component emission scheme where the low and high energy components are attributed to synchrotron and inverse Compton (<b>IC)</b> <b>radiation,</b> respectively.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} aimed to {{establish}} a consistent lower limb lymphedema animal model for further investigation of the mechanism and treatment of lymphedema. Methods: Lymphedema in the lower extremity was created by removing unilateral inguinal lymph nodes followed by 20, 30, and 40 Gy (groups IA, IB, and <b>IC,</b> respectively) <b>radiation</b> or by removing both inguinal lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes followed by 20 Gy (group II) radiation in Sprague-Dawley rats (350 – 400 [*]g). Tc 99 lymphoscintigraphy was used to monitor lymphatic flow patterns. Volume differentiation was assessed by microcomputed tomography and defined as the percentage change of the lesioned limb compared to the healthy limb. Results: At 4 weeks postoperatively, 0 % in group IA (n = 3), 37. 5 % in group IB (n = 16), and 50 % in group IC (n = 26) developed lymphedema in the lower limb with total mortality and morbidity rate of 0 %, 56. 3 %, and 50 %, respectively. As {{a result of the}} high morbidity and mortality rates, 20 Gy was selected, and the success rate for development of lymphedema in the lower limb in group II was 81. 5 % (n = 27). The mean volume differentiation of the lymphedematous limb compared to the health limb was 7. 76 % ± 1. 94 % in group II, which was statistically significant compared to group I (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Removal of both inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes followed by radiation of 20 Gy can successfully develop lymphedema in the lower limb with minimal morbidity in 4 months...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new network-based concept of real-time plant monitoring {{based on the}} wireless sensor network. The wireless sensor network is a novel technology to perform distributed sensing tasks, especially for applications such as environmental monitoring, smart spaces, medical systems and etc. The advances in MEMS technology, sensing technology and wireless communications have enabled the development of real time, detailed, wide-range, low-cost, low-power and multifunctional wireless sensor network. On the other hand, semiconductor devices like <b>ICs</b> suffer from <b>radiation</b> damage. We must consider this effect for applying wireless sensor network devices to nuclear power plants. Radiation may produce one-time noise signals in the sensor network, or it may damage the wireless sensor network device. Therefore monitoring system will be unreliable for nuclear power plants in ordinary way of composing wireless sensor networks. In this study, we develop a new concept of a robust wireless sensor network, that has a tolerance against both the partial node’s failure and packet errors; realized by a Self-Maintenance function. The Self-maintenance function is a function that enables an artifact to find, diagnosi...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith the {{transistor}} size shrinking and ICs {{operating at}} both low energies and high frequencies, devices {{have become more}} sensitive to Single Event Effects (SEE) {{as a result of}} particles produced by cosmic rays when colliding to the earth's atmosphere. Therefore, devices destined for high reliability applications such as avionics, medical devices or nuclear plants must be exhaustively tested for fault tolerance against soft errors. There have been many studies analyzing SEE but also proposing methods for the mitigation of the <b>ICs</b> against <b>radiation.</b> Such studies have been conducted at the LIRMM laboratory, and more specifically concerning the effects of thermal and high energy neutrons on SRAMs. My thesis will continue this effort for the better understanding of neutron induced effects on SRAMs but also on other types of memories and electronic devices. Part of this research is the irradiation of electronic components with high-energy neutrons usingparticle accelerators at specialized facilities such as ISIS at Didcot (UK) and TSL at Uppsala (Sweden). Recently, we had the opportunity to perform experiments on both these facilities, observing the effects of different energy neutrons on SRAMs and MRAMs. Moreover, we conducted a survey on the effects of neutrons on SRAMs at the simulation level, in order to define better the origin of Multiple Bit Upsets (MBU) which is the flip of more than one bits due to a particle hit on the memory. Future work will include the analysis of data, retrieved from the TSL facility experiments on SRAMs and MRAMs. An in depth study of MRAMs and their resilience to soft errors when hit by high energy neutrons will be done. Finally, other electronic devices such as FPGAs, microcontrollers etc will be tested and analyzed under radiation both at simulation and experimental level...|$|R
