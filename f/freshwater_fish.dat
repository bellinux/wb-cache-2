The Murray cod is an {{important}} part of Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively <b>freshwater</b> <b>fish</b> in Australia, and one of the largest in the world.

40|$|Those of us {{interested}} in <b>freshwater</b> <b>fishes</b> and related environmental issues have waited several years for Paul Skelton's A Complete Guide to the <b>Freshwater</b> <b>Fishes</b> of Southern Africa.

Although Skelton's book is not specifically aimed at the scientist, it contains condensed, updated and accurate information on description, distribution, conservation status, biology, ecology and the many uses of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>fishes</b> of southern Africa. Dave Voorveld's and Elizabeth Tarr's remarkably detailed illustrations of the 245 fish species, including 29 marine and estuarine species, are without doubt an outstanding feature of this book. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is <b>freshwater</b> <b>fish.</b> Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. <b>Freshwater</b> <b>fish</b> are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{traditional}} cuisine {{varies from}} one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria draw upon culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, {{as well as}} condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by Hungarian, Austrian and Turkish culinary styles. In that area, meats, <b>freshwater</b> <b>fish</b> and vegetable dishes are predominant.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and <b>freshwater</b> <b>fish</b> was also eaten.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos.

5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems.

More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth.
