5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially when one <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding {{glasses on the}} advice of Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm that he <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E

5|$|Bond then {{travels to}} Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese {{entrepreneur}} suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured {{and placed in}} Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping {{with the aid of}} Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E

5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E
5|$|The total {{net assets}} {{owned by the}} {{university}} as of 30 April 2015 stands at $892.7 million. The university had completed the 2014–2015 year with revenues of $990.8 million, expenses of $912.2 million and an excess of revenues over expenses of $78.6 million. McMaster's revenue comes from endowment income, gifts, fees, and annual grants from the City of Hamilton, the Hamilton-Wentworth Region, the Province of Ontario, and the Government of Canada. The largest source of revenue <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> grants provided by the government, valued at nearly C$265.2 million. As of 30 April 2014, McMaster's financial endowment was valued at C$655.5 million. The financing of McMaster's scholarships and bursaries takes up 40 per cent of the endowments received.

5|$|Though {{the subway}} system {{operates}} on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours {{some of the}} designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often {{referred to as the}} 'shuttle train' version of its full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations must be maintained while the system <b>is</b> <b>operating.</b> This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.|$|E

5|$|When Sde Dov does close, its {{military}} terminal would be relocated to the Palmachim Airbase and civilian activities would be relocated to Ben Gurion Airport. With capacity at Ben Gurion projected {{to reach a}} maximum {{over the next few}} decades however, the concept of building an airport offshore in the Tel Aviv region may yet be revived in the future. Sde Dov itself <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> near to capacity, however, with annual passenger movements around 700,000 and a potential capacity of 950,000.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
