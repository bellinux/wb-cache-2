500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> good {{care of all the}} {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
