He also has {{a home in the}} Irish seaside village of Dalkey near Dublin, where legal actions against two different neighbours concerning safety and privacy issues have been taken to court in 2001 and in 2010. In the former case, Morrison pursued his action {{all the way to the}} Irish Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminals}} {{turned out}} to be unfriendly to the 747, since passengers spilled out of the <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> into the halls. When security checkpoints were added in the 1970s to stem hijackings, they were difficult and expensive to implement since security checkpoints had to be installed at each <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> rather than at a centralized area.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{passenger}} services were nonexistent downstream {{of the security}} checkpoint in the <b>gate</b> <b>area.</b> No restrooms were available, and shops, restaurants, newsstands, ATMs or any other {{passenger services}} were not available without exiting the secure area and being re-screened upon re-entry.|$|E

25|$|According to old documents, {{there was}} a wooden {{apartment}} above the <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> until {{the second half of}} the 19th century. It has been used used as a pavilion by Mehmed, a depository for the properties of those who died inside the palace without heirs and the receiving department of the treasury.

25|$|The {{university}} was temporarily {{based in the}} city. A lecture theatre and the university's first Junior Common Room were based in Centenary Church, a former Congregational church beside the old factory premises of Waring & Gillow, which were used to accommodate the new students. Many new students were housed in Morecambe. The Grand Theatre was leased as a main lecture room and 112 and 114 in the St Leonard's <b>Gate</b> <b>area</b> became teaching and recreational rooms. The library occupied the old workshops of Shrigley and Hunt on Castle Hill.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco Bay's profile changed {{dramatically}} in the late 19th century and again with the initiation of dredging by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 20th century. Before about 1860, most bay shores (with the exception of rocky shores, {{such as those in}} Carquinez Strait; along Marin shoreline; Point Richmond; Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>area)</b> contained extensive wetlands that graded nearly invisibly from freshwater wetlands to salt marsh and then tidal mudflat. A deep channel ran {{through the center of the}} bay, following the ancient drowned river valley.|$|E
2500|$|One {{major problem}} remains after the renovation. The {{modifications}} necessary to implement TSA security created {{a situation where}} many [...] "sanitized" [...] <b>gate</b> <b>areas</b> have only a single restroom stall each {{for men and women}} (added during the renovation); the remaining restrooms are across the hall, which is now outside the secured area, necessitating an extra trip through TSA security. , certain <b>gate</b> <b>areas</b> had no serviceable restrooms within the sterile area.|$|R

25|$|The risk {{of further}} fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have {{prompted}} Trajan's decision {{to rebuild the}} Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured {{as part of the}} Roman community, alongside her gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian's reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a jetty {{dedicated}} to all U.S. bound flights, which holds 18 gates: 72 through 89. For access to gate 87, 88 or 89, passengers must go down one level via an escalator. Gate 56, 58 and 60 (part of the international jetty) {{can also be used}} for a U.S. bound flight. They can be isolated from the other gates by moving glass walls known as swing gates. Unlike other jetties, the transborder jetty requires passengers to go through security checkpoint C and then the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and lastly through the duty-free shop before accessing their gates. The <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> contains the same services as the other parts of the airport such as shops, restaurants, rest zones and cafés. If needed, some gates can be isolated in order to offer additional security checkpoints if an aircraft flies to a potential risk zone like Washington–National.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007 an [...] "end-around taxiway" [...] opened, Taxiway Victor. It is {{expected}} to save an estimated $26 million to $30 million in fuel each year by allowing airplanes landing on the northernmost runway to taxi to the <b>gate</b> <b>area</b> without preventing other aircraft from taking off.

2500|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{reported}} that the crash occurred two hours after a ground stop was declared at the airport because of severe thunderstorms in the area ("red alert" [...] status, which, for safety reasons, halts all ground activity on the apron and <b>gate</b> <b>area.</b> Aircraft can still land, and take off if still in queue). Visibility {{at the time of}} the accident was reported to be very poor. There was lightning, strong gusty winds, and hail at the time and the rain just began as the plane was landing. Within two hours the winds increased from 5 to 30km/h (3 to 20mph) and the temperature dropped from [...] A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect since 11:30a.m. and all outbound flights and ground servicing operations had been canceled but landings were still permitted.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} role that the denuded zone around Si nanocrystals {{obtained}} by chemical vapor deposition plays on the fluctuations of the dot surface coverage. In fact, the capture mechanism of the silicon adatoms in the proximity of existing dots restricts the number of possible nucleation sites, the final dot size, and the dot position, thus driving the process toward partial self-order. We numerically evaluate the relative dispersion of surface coverage for several <b>gate</b> <b>areas</b> and compare the results to the fully random case. The coverage dispersion is related to the fluctuations from bit to bit of the threshold voltage window (Δ Vth) distribution of nanocrystal memories. The evaluations, compared to experimental data on Δ Vth extrapolated to small <b>gate</b> <b>areas,</b> provide very favorable projections on the scalability of these memories. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
