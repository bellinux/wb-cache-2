50|$|The {{crisis of}} World War II led Congress to pass four <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> {{statutes}} between 1940 and 1943. The 1940 rates ranged from 25 to 50 {{percent and the}} 1941 ones from 35 to 60 percent. In 1942 a flat rate of 90 percent was adopted, with a postwar refund of 10 percent; in 1943 the rate was increased to 95 percent, with a 10 percent refund. Congress gave corporations two alternative <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax credit choices: either 95 percent of average earnings for 1936-1939 or an invested capital credit, initially 8 percent of capital but later graduated from 5 to 8 percent. In 1945 Congress repealed the tax, effective 1 January 1946. The Korean War induced Congress to reimpose an <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax, effective from 1 July 1950 to 31 December 1953. The tax rate was 30 percent of <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> with the top corporate tax rate rising from 45% to 47%, a 70 percent ceiling for the combined corporation and <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> taxes.|$|R

50|$|In economics, {{profit in}} the {{accounting}} {{sense of the}} excess of revenue over cost {{is the sum of}} two components: normal profit and economic profit. Normal profit is the profit that is necessary to just cover the opportunity costs of the owner-manager or of the firm's investors. In the absence of this much profit, these parties would withdraw their time and funds from the firm and use them to better advantage elsewhere. In contrast, economic profit, sometimes called <b>excess</b> <b>profit,</b> is profit in excess of what is required to cover the opportunity costs.|$|E

In 1918 a national law limited the tax to corporations and increased the rates. Concurrent with this 1918 tax, the federal government imposed, for the year 1918 only, an alternative tax, ranging up to 80 percent, with the taxpayer paying whichever was higher. In 1921 the <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax was repealed despite powerful attempts to make it permanent. In 1933 and 1935 Congress enacted two mild <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> taxes as supplements to a capital stock tax.|$|R

In 2005, {{the government}} introduced new restrictions granting to the state-owned oil and gas company KazMunayGas status of contractor and at least half of any production sharing agreement (PSA). New tax structure, enforced in January 2004, included a so-called [...] "rent tax" [...] on exports, a progressive tax that increases as oil prices grow. The amendment raised the government's share of oil income to a range of 65-85%.The new structure includes an <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> tax, and limits foreign participation to 50 percent in each offshore project with no guarantees of operatorship.|$|E
5000|$|Motivation for {{introducing}} special taxes on petroleum production {{is rooted in}} rent theory and the assumption that oil and gas resources provide an extraordinary rate of resource rent (economic rent). The term [...] "resource rent" [...] expresses {{the difference between the}} values of hydrocarbons extracted from a deposit and the total costs of exploring and producing the hydrocarbons, synonymous with <b>excess</b> <b>profit.</b> Resource rents will be distributed among the state and the oil companies engaged in extracting hydrocarbons in a license. The rents must recover costs undertaken by the companies, give some company profit and give income for the state (in US the landowner) to compensate for the takeout of natural resources. Income tax and special petroleum tax to the state may also apply and carried by the resource rents.|$|E

50|$|In May 1915 Asquith {{formed a}} {{coalition}} government. On 16 May McKenna {{had done all}} he could to make his friend change his mind; he has also spoken with Lloyd George. It had all been done in utter secrecy. McKenna became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the meantime, McKenna oversaw {{the issue of the}} Second War Loan in June 1915, at an interest rate of 4.5%, although his first budget was actually on 21 September 1915 was a serious attempt to deal with an impending debt crisis. Revenues were rising, but not enough to cover the £1.6 billion government expenditure. McKenna imposed crippling tax rates. Massive impositions increases on the richest, were joined by 50% <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> tax, and 50% sales and purchase taxes. Attempted Post Office charge increases failed due to trade union opposition and a public outcry. These were instead raised in a Post Office and Telegraph bill.|$|E
50|$|BDO USA, LLP {{was founded}} as Seidman and Seidman in New York City in 1910 by three {{immigrant}} brothers: Maximillian L. Seidman, Francis E. Seidman, and Jacob S. Seidman. At {{that time the}} accounting profession was in its infancy, with fewer than 2,200 practicing CPAs in the United States. Shortly thereafter in 1913, the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, followed by the Revenue Act of 1913 with new impositions of U.S. Federal income tax enacted by Congress in that year. M. L. Seidman saw {{the potential of the}} accountant's role to provide tax services to individuals. By 1917, Congress enacted the first revenue bills and the U.S. entry into World War I created the need for corporate income and <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> taxes. At the same time, federal spending rose to $18.9 billion with 58 percent of the federal revenues provided from income taxes. M.L. Seidman and his siblings, who joined him in his new accounting firm, seized the opportunity to provide tax services to businesses in addition to individuals.|$|E
5000|$|The April 1916 budget saw further large {{rises in}} income and <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> taxes, {{at a time}} when prices of basic food {{commodities}} were rising. Sales taxes were extended to rail tickets, mineral water, cider and perry, and entertainments. The government pledged that if they issued War Loan at the even higher interest (as they did with the 5% issue of 1917), holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. His predecessor David Lloyd George criticised McKenna in his memoirs for increasing the interest rate from 3.5% on the 1914 War Loan {{at a time when}} investors had few alternatives and might even have had their capital [...] "conscripted" [...] by the government. Not only did the change ultimately increase the nation's interest payments by £100 million/year but it meant rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression. Compared with France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916. McKenna fell out with Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England. Furthermore, he tried to sequestrate the assets of the US Prudential Assurance Company to pay for American war materiel purchases.|$|E

40|$|The Economic Value Added {{formally}} translates {{the theoretical}} notion of <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> (also known as residual income). Its use is so firmly entrenched in applied corporate finance and management accounting that its name {{is often used}} as a noun for denoting the concept of <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> itself. This paper investigates the conceptual properties of such a notion and, in particular, it studies {{the relations between the}} <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> generated in a period and the <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> generated in the following period, showing that the classical approach forgets the past story of the project and the evolution of the capital invested. On the basis of this analysis, a new approach to residual income is offered, called Systemic Value Added (SVA). The latter takes account of the dynamic system governing the evolution of the capital invested, and is coherently additive in that the uncompounded sum of the SVAs leads to the Net Final Value. Interesting relations between the classical approach and the new approach are provided, and a final conventionalist position is endorsed: the <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> is not an unambiguous concept and the choice between either approaches depends on the pieces of information one is willing to retrieve. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tells the}} story of a student of {{economics}} and finance who meets a couple of alleged psychopaths, suffering from the ‘syndrome of Zelig’, so that they think of themselves to be experts of economic and financial issues. While speaking, they come across the concept of <b>excess</b> <b>profit.</b> The student tells them that the formal way to translate <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> is to apply Stewart’s (1991) EVA model and shows that this model is equivalent to Peccati’s (1987, 1991, 1992) decomposition model of a project’s Net Present (Final) Value. The ‘Zeligs’ listen to him carefully, then try to apply themselves the EVA model: Unfortunately, both She-Zelig and He-Zelig seem to feel uneasy with basic mathematics, so they make some mistakes. Consequently, each of them miscalculates the <b>excess</b> <b>profit.</b> Strangely enough, they make different mistakes but both get to the (correct) Net Final Value of the project and, in addition, their excess profits do coincide. Further, the (biased) models presented by the Zeligs, though different from the EVA model, seem to bear strong relations to the latter. The student is rather surprised. I give my version of this event, arguing that the Zeligs are offering us a rational way of measuring <b>excess</b> <b>profit,</b> alternative to the standard one (EVA) but equally valuable. As I see it, they are only adopting a different cognitive interpretation of the concept of <b>excess</b> <b>profit,</b> which is based on a counterfactual conditional that differs from Stewart’s and Peccati’s. ...|$|E
