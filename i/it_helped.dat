5|$|Wollstonecraft later repudiated Mary, {{writing that}} it was laughable. However, {{scholars}} have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of an energetic, unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the {{first of its kind}} in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development {{in the history of the}} novel because <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> shape an emerging feminist discourse.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Wallace {{needed a}} £500 advance from the {{publisher}} of The Geographical Distribution of Animals {{to avoid having to}} sell some of his personal property. Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science.

5|$|In 1918, {{the party}} was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} First Republic of Armenia, which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920. After its leadership was exiled by the communists, the ARF established itself within Armenian diaspora communities, where <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> Armenians preserve their cultural identity. After the fall of the USSR, it returned to Armenia, where it now again has a presence as a minor party in Armenia's parliament. Prior to Serzh Sargsyan's election as president of Armenia and for a short time thereafter, the ARF was a member of the governing coalition, even though it nominated its own candidate in the presidential elections.|$|E

Lessons was reprinted, translated, pirated, and imitated until the 20th century; according to Myers, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> found a female tradition of educational writing.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{is a star}} {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Lyra {{in the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, a NASA-led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets. The star, which is slightly hotter, larger, and more massive than the Sun, has one gas giant in its orbit, Kepler-8b. This gas giant is larger than Jupiter, but is less massive, and thus more diffuse. The planet's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets. As the fifth confirmed planetary system verified by Kepler, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> demonstrate the capabilities of the Kepler spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Realizing the North Vietnamese {{would try}} to destroy the installation, Secord advised the U.S Embassy in Vientiane to {{evacuate}} all U.S. personnel. However, high-ranking U.S. officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> {{save the lives of}} U.S. pilots every day it remained in operation. In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.|$|E

When the October Revolution in Russia and the Romanian armistice took Romania out of the Entente camp, the Corps was left without backing and purpose. However, it inspired the creation of similar units in Entente countries, most successfully the Romanian Legion of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The hit is {{regarded}} as the defining moment of Martinez's 18-year Major League Baseball career. Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus' call of the play—which is equally memorable to Seattle fans as the play itself—is also regarded as the highlight of his career. The play is also credited with keeping a Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle, as <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> garner support for a new taxpayer-funded stadium for the Mariners. That stadium, known today as Safeco Field, opened in 1999, with the Double depicted in a mural as part of the stadium's art collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxable value}} of an estate was {{initially}} assessed from the Domesday Survey, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or {{on the number of}} plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> them to feather properly.|$|E
