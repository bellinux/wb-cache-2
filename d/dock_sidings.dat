5000|$|On November {{evening of}} 28/29 November 1940, a German {{parachute}} mine {{fell on the}} Garston Gas Works in Liverpool. It was unknown whether it was magnetic, acoustic, delayed action or just a [...] "dud". Consequently, this caused extensive disruption in the area, with factory work halted and over 6,000 people removed from the vicinity. Additionally, railway and <b>dock</b> <b>sidings</b> were closed and the gas supply {{to the south and}} east of Liverpool was disrupted.|$|E
50|$|In 1888 the Glasgow Central Railway was authorised; {{supported}} by the Caledonian Railway, it was to run from Dalmarnock to Maryhill through the centre of Glasgow, with a low level station under Glasgow Central, and making a connection at Stobcross to the extensive <b>dock</b> <b>sidings</b> there. The line was prodigiously difficult to construct, {{and it did not}} open throughout until 1896. It was heavily used for suburban passenger purposes, but also by goods trains to and from the dock.|$|E

50|$|The current {{station was}} opened by the NER on 1 October 1869 (along with their line from Thorne Junction to Gilberdyke). Passenger trains from the Knottingley {{direction}} initially ran to a terminus station {{next to the}} docks but this was closed when the NER station opened, trains then using a short curve to join the main line at Potter's Grange Junction 440 yd south of the new station. The former L&Y line into the docks remained a busy freight route for many years afterwards, but has now been lifted (though access to the remaining <b>dock</b> <b>sidings</b> is still possible from the main line).|$|E
50|$|The wooden station {{building}} {{was of a}} standard design, and had a long, sealed platform. A veranda covered the platform {{in front of the}} building, and extended a short distance to either side of the building. Two semaphore signal gantries rose up through the veranda, and several loops ran through the station yard. Other facilities were provided at the station at various times, including a social hall (later a second such facility was added, west of and near to the intersection of Station Street and McLean Street), a post and telegraph office, a crossing keeper for the McLean Street level crossing, a goods shed, and a locomotive depot. There were <b>dock</b> <b>sidings</b> {{at both ends of the}} platform; the west (Palmerston North) end dock was renewed in 1921.|$|E
5000|$|Machinery on the dock, {{including}} capstans and {{the lock}} gates were worked by hydraulic power. The dock incorporated {{its own power}} supply, consisting three 20 by 6 ft (long by diameter) boilers supplying a [...] steam engine which powered both the hydraulic system via a hydraulic accumulator at , {{as well as being}} able to pump mains water around the dock. The works also required the resiting (1864) of the goods line and sidings of the North Eastern Railway's (NER) Hull and Selby Line; when complete the dock included a connection to the NER, and had doubled track or wider rail sidings on both quays, with the rails crossing the lock entrance by a hydraulically operated swing girder bridge. The <b>dock's</b> <b>sidings</b> were connected to the NER's system west of the dock.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Caledonian Railway on their Cleland and Midcalder Line on 9 July 1869. Breich {{is named after}} the nearby Breich Water. The station pre-dates the present day (2015) village of Breich and OS maps show that it has never possessed freight {{facilities}} such as loading <b>docks</b> and <b>sidings,</b> etc.|$|R

5000|$|The {{modernisation}} scheme {{adopted by}} British Railways in the 1960s {{resulted in the}} decommissioning of {{a considerable number of}} steam locomotives in a short space of time. Many of these were acquired by Woodham Brothers, who laid them aside in the <b>dock</b> storage <b>sidings</b> at Barry. Due to scrap metal price fluctuations they did not immediately dismantle them, and in fact they remained there for many years. The location became famous as a last repository of the engines. In some cases the locomotives were later acquired by preservation societies and restored to operation.|$|R
50|$|The Brooklyn Army Terminal {{is a large}} {{complex of}} warehouses, offices, piers, <b>docks,</b> cranes, rail <b>sidings</b> and cargo loading {{equipment}} on 95 acre between 58th and 63rd Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York City. It was the largest military supply base in the United States through World War II, and was later redeveloped for commercial use.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 {{a scheme}} was {{developed}} to improve the fishing harbour arrangements at Padstow; this {{was supported by the}} government and the LSWR; the Company alone spent £10,350 on the <b>dock</b> wall and <b>sidings</b> and sheds, and took up £30,000 of the Harbour Commissioners' bonds. The work was completed by 1920, by which time the LSWR was the dominant partner in the operation of the harbour.|$|R
50|$|The harbour was {{originally}} {{built by the}} Lowestoft and Norwich Navigation Company and developed by the Norfolk Railway following {{the construction of the}} Norwich to Lowestoft railway. The original Inner Harbour was constructed in 1831 when the Lake Lothing joined to the sea, as shown on a chart based on a survey by William Hewett, Commander of HMS Fairy dated 1834 and the Outer Harbour in 1937. The railway line ran alongside {{the north side of the}} docks and a series of <b>docks</b> railway <b>sidings</b> were used mainly for fishing and freight wagons. These lines have mainly been removed from service but in places sections of the track can still be seen.|$|R
5000|$|The station had two {{platforms}} and loop line with originally a goods siding and loading dock to the north, later a second loading <b>dock</b> and <b>sidings</b> were added on the [...] "down" [...] side. The station building {{was on the}} [...] "up" [...] side and was 2.5 miles from Keith railway station. A stationmasters' house was provided as was a porters' house. Located on a gradient of 1 in 60 the gradient eased {{a little to the}} north at 1 in 70. On 7 November 1917 the Admiralty requisitioned the track between Aultmore and Portessie for use at Invergordon and Inverness however in June 1918 they also lifted the track between Aultmore and Crooksmill, leaving however the station buildings and sidings intact.|$|R
50|$|From Farthinghoe {{the track}} curved round {{to the west}} to run nearly {{parallel}} with the Great Western's line from Oxford to Banbury before entering Merton Street (21.75 miles from Bletchley). The wooden main station building was frugally built with a timber island platform covered by a glazed roof supported by steel columns. A timber goods shed was initially provided to be later rebuilt in brick. The locomotive shed had capacity for eight engines and up to 1934 acted as a sub-depot for Bletchley with men rostered there. A cattle <b>dock</b> and <b>sidings</b> were provided to handle the substantial agricultural traffic; sidings also led to the nearby gasworks and the Great Western's Banbury yard. The timber boarding on the station roof had by 1956 reached such a condition that it posed a danger to passengers and it was removed leaving the metal supports and piping which were painted white.|$|R
50|$|A {{moderately}} sized station building served Cunninghamhead, {{with two}} platforms and a signal box {{a short distance}} away. A rectangular sandstone shelter or store was situated on the northbound platform. Maps and photographs of Cunninghamhead show a substantial goods shed and a small weigh house with extensive cattle <b>docks</b> and other <b>sidings.</b> A Stationmaster's house was also present. The 1860 map records the electric telegraph belonging to the railway, this being a novelty in those days. A single running line and some sidings were all that remained here at closure.|$|R
50|$|Cogan {{railway station}} {{is located on}} the Vale of Glamorgan Line and {{provides}} services to Barry, Rhoose, Bridgend and Cardiff. Until 1968 Cogan had two further platforms across {{the other side of the}} main Windsor Road and located on the Penarth and Sully branch line, from the Cogan Junction points down the coastline to where it rejoined the main line at Cadoxton. The through link was closed under the effects of the Beeching Axe and the rail spur now terminates at Penarth. Dingle Road Halt and Penarth station remain open but the platforms at Cogan were closed when the line was reduced to a single track branchline. Most of the station buildings still stand and have been used by several private businesses including a shooting range, a garden centre, a second hand car lot and a marine chandlers. The area originally covered by the Cogan and Penarth <b>Dock's</b> railway <b>sidings</b> and engine maintenance sheds now contains a large Tesco supermarket.|$|R
50|$|The Minsterley {{branch line}} {{which was built}} as a joint GWR/LNWR line, opened on 14 February 1862. This railway line ran {{nine and a half}} miles from Shrewsbury via Cruckmeole Junction near Hanwood to the {{stations}} at Plealey Road, Pontesbury and finally the terminus at Minsterley. The creation of the line enabled milk to be transported by rail from the large creamery at Minsterley and lead ore to be transported from the nearby mines at Snailbeach. At one time the terminus in Minsterley boasted a milk wharf, goods shed, cattle and horse <b>docks</b> and numerous <b>sidings.</b> The line closed in May 1967.|$|R
50|$|There are 3 buses {{an hour to}} Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin {{operated}} by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at {{the eastern side of}} the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle <b>dock</b> and goods <b>sidings,</b> seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.|$|R
500|$|The initial plans {{allowed for}} loading coal onto vessels from eleven {{high-level}} coal tips and four cranes {{on the north}} side of the dock, from five low-level tips on the Mole and from one tip at the west end of the dock. There was space for additional tips on the Mole, the south side of the dock and the basin. Hydraulic pressure was used to operate all the machinery, supplied by engine houses of which there were three [...] [...] An engineers' report of 1901 contained the following extract: The tips have lifts of 37, 42, and 45 feet, and are each capable of lifting 20 tons. All tips are provided with two weigh-bridges, one on the full and the other on the empty roads. The machinery at the docks is worked by hydraulic power obtained at three engine-houses, which contain nine pairs of compound, horizontal, surface-condensing engines, with cylinders of 16 inches and 28 inches diameter and 24 inches stroke, indicating 250 H.P. per pair. Steam is supplied at 80 lbs. per square inch by twenty-five Lancashire boilers, 28 feet long by 7 feet diameter. The pressure-pumps are of the differential-ram principle, and maintain a pressure in the mains of 750 lbs. per square inch. The whole of the <b>docks,</b> coal-tips, <b>sidings,</b> etc., are lighted by electricity. Battery Hill pumphouse at Barry Island was demolished after 1945 but the main part of the Bendricks building (referred to as 'Sully hydraulic engine house' in R.A.COOKE'S section 44b GWR track diagrams) lived on until just after the Millennium and ironically, with the nationalisation of the former 'big four' railway groups to become British Railways (BR) in 1947, the Barry Railway initials survive on one of the gables at Barry Island railway station and the initials BR ...|$|R
5000|$|The station {{opened on}} 30 October 1848 as Allerton by the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway. The station was {{situated}} immediately {{west of the}} A1 bridge. Goods facilities were installed {{on the north side}} of the running line with a crossing immediately west of the entrance to the cattle <b>dock.</b> Two <b>sidings</b> served six coal cells. Movements in the goods yard were controlled by flags. In 1911, the census revealed that a population of 457 was served at Allerton station and NER statistics showed that only 5,901 tickets were issued that year whereas [...] had sold 15,169 and [...] had sold 191,752. The principal goods traffic handled at the station was 421 tons of barley and 367 tons of potatoes and 41 wagons of livestock were dispatched from the station. Coal was received via rail. The station's name was eventually changed to Hopperton on 21 September 1925 to avoid confusion with the Allerton station in Liverpool. The York - Harrogate line had no Sunday services for most of its life until one appeared in the July 1937 Bradshaw timetable, but none called at Hopperton. From May 1943 there was a slight decline in services from seven trains to York and six to Harrogate to six to York and five to Harrogate. Sunday services were also stopped. The station survived nationalisation but its trains services were almost annihilated as seen in the summer 1958 timetable, with only two trains going to York and one to York on Saturdays only. The station was on of four on the line to close to passengers, the other three being Hessay, Marston Moor and Goldsborough on 15 September 1958. The station closed to goods traffic on 5 November 1962.|$|R
50|$|Some 200 acre {{in total}} between {{the island and}} the {{mainland}} were used for <b>docks,</b> quays, <b>sidings</b> and other facilities.The No.1 dock, the first dock that was built, is 3400 by 1100 ft and covers about 70 acre. The western {{end of the first}} dock is divided into two arms by a projecting Mole.No. 1 dock has a full width of 1600 ft at the eastern end, so the largest vessels could swing even when the tips and quays were fully occupied.There was a 700 by 100 ft graving dock (dry-dock) at the north-east corner of this dock but due to the Waterfront development in the 1990s, this has been filled in.This commercial graving dock was capable of handling the largest vessels of the day.In 1893, to the east of this, there was a timber pond of 24 acre connected to No.1 dock by a short channel almost parallel with the then existing dry-dock but this link was later severed and part of its length converted to another dry-dock and the pond beyond dispensed with and filled in {{to make way for the}} necessary high-level rail viaducts and embankments run to the No.2 dock coal hoists. The remaining dry-dock, minus its floatable caisson, is still flooded with the waterline commoned with that of the two docks (July 2017). By 1901 with No.2 dock in use, a second timber pond was included north of the dock. It was partly backfilled after 1960 but intersected by the docks road level crossing (Wimborne Rd)from Cadoxton to the Bendricks. This is the single line railfreight link from Network Rail's Cadoxton station to the No.2 docks quays and south-side rail infrastructure and includes a 180° curve from north-west to south-east side of the dock, this now being the only rail access to the entire docks area and serving remaining sidings on the Sully Moors industrial complex, Dow Corning silicone plant and intermodal railfreighttraffic(2017).|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 October 1864 by the Peebles Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{at the end of}} Station Road. This station replaced the original so the line to Galashiels could be extended. Although the old station was used for goods, an additional goods station was built to the south of the passenger facilities on the down side. It comprised six sidings, passing through a brick goods shed and a wide goods <b>dock.</b> Two further <b>sidings</b> passed through {{the other side of the}} dock. The three remaining sidings could only be accessed from the south and they ran diagonally across the yard. Private Private sidings served Ballantyne's Mill, Dyer and Co.'s saw mills and Peebles gas works. Peebles Junction was to the south of the goods station and allowed direct access from the Caledonian Railway to the Peebles Railway. During 1905 the facilities were improved by the North British Railway. The original station buildings were used as temporary waiting rooms while a new one was constructed. On 25 September 1950 the station had the suffix 'east' added to its name, while the Caledonian station, which was open for goods traffic, was renamed Peebles West. This suffix was short lived and was removed from timetables in February 1958. The junction was taken out of use when Peebles West closed on 1 August 1959. The station closed to passengers and goods traffic on 5 February 1962 and track lifting was complete on the following year.|$|R

There was space for additional tips on the Mole, the south side of the dock and the basin. Hydraulic pressure was used to operate all the machinery, supplied by engine houses of which there were three at the south-west side of No.1 dock, Battery Hill, (Barry Island) and Bendricks. An engineers report of 1901 contained the following extract: The tips have lifts of 37, 42, and 45 feet, and are each capable of lifting 20 tons.

As at 1947, two hydraulic accumulators were located adjacent to the No.1 Dock hydraulic & electricity generating house and former Barry Rly Cos loco works, south-west of the dock, one at the junction of Subway Rd and the low-level docks through road and level crossing near what was the General HQ of the Barry Railway Co and what is now the Vale of Glamorgan Council Civil Office building, one north of the now removed New cut swingbridge and south of the former Graving Dock Junction & level crossing, one at the cross link road from Cadoxton to the Bendricks, north of No.2 dock and one at the foot of the steps of the former shortened and later removed Clive Rd, Barry Island footbridge to No.1 dock. Their function was to back up and stabilise fluctuating hydraulic pressure as the coal hoists and other users were working. Most of these were detectable from aerial photographs taken between 1921 and 1929 and can be seen on other websites.One pair of fixed coal hoists {{on the north side}} was 174 ft apart, and two pairs were 200 ft apart. This spacing was chosen since it was the same as that in the Cardiff docks, and ships had been built to match the spacing so they could be loaded at two positions simultaneously.|$|R
