5000|$|A {{great deal}} of the value of woolen {{textiles}} was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product. In each of the centers of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the [...] "putting-out" [...] system, or [...] "cottage industry", and the Verlagssystem by the Germans. In this system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of <b>Harris</b> <b>tweeds,</b> the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product. Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms. Fernand Braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275. The system effectively bypassed the guilds' restrictions.|$|R
