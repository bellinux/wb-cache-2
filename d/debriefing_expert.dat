40|$|BackgroundCancer {{often has}} a {{profound}} and enduring impact on sexuality, affecting both {{patients and their}} partners. Most healthcare professionals in cancer and palliative care are struggling to address intimate issues with the patients in their care. MethodsStudy 1 : An Australian study using semi-structured interviews and documentary data analysis. Study 2 : Building on this Australian study, using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, data were collected in the Netherlands through interviewing 15 cancer patients, 13 partners and 20 healthcare professionals working in cancer and palliative care. The hermeneutic analysis was supported by ATLAS. ti and enhanced by peer <b>debriefing</b> and <b>expert</b> consultation. ResultsFor patients and partners a person-oriented approach {{is a prerequisite for}} discussing the whole of their experience regarding the impact of cancer treatment on their sexuality and intimacy. Not all healthcare professionals are willing or capable of adopting such a person-oriented approach. ConclusionA complementary team approach, with clearly defined roles for different team members and clear referral pathways, is required to enhance communication about sexuality and intimacy in cancer and palliative care. This approach, that includes the acknowledgement of the importance of patients’ and partners’ sexuality and intimacy by all team members, is captured in the Stepped Skills model that was developed as an outcome of the Dutch study...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{abstract}} is {{a proposal}} for a Pro/Con Debate of a Centralized Simulation Service. Medical services across the UK have been centralized to improve clinical care. As Simulation becomes an integral part of medical training and clinical governance, should Simulation services also be centralized? Improvements in both surgical training and clinical effectiveness have been demonstrated through the centralization of services. This has been attributed to increased exposure to cases in these centres and a good infrastructure for delivery of care. Experienced staff in a centre appropriately set up for the delivery of clinical care has resulted in vast improvements in the service. Objectives: To explore and discuss the benefits and shortfalls of a Centralized Simulation Service. Questions for debate are drawn from a telephone survey of 18 London-based Simulation Centres. Material/Patients and Methods or Expected Audience: Expected Audience: Simulation Centre Directors, Simulation Fellows and Specialists, Service Provision Managers, academics, Clinical Staff. Results / Requirements/Specific needs: A telephone survey of Simulation Centres in London revealed that smaller centres had sufficient kit but had problems recruiting Faculty. The majority of Faculty were Simulation “enthusiasts” with clinical duties. These smaller centres reported that Faculty had to balance clinical work with teaching commitments and clinical work took priority. Many smaller centres identified a recent increase in demands on clinical service provision and less professional leave granted to Clinical Staff wishing to be Faculty. The converse was true of the larger centres who identified fewer issues with recruiting Faculty. Some of these larger centres had a clear faculty training pathway and ran courses almost daily. Conclusion / Description of the session: Pros: The exponential rise in popularity of Medical Simulation has been accompanied by technological advances to improve fidelity. The opportunities are endless however a good teaching session relies heavily on the experience of the faculty and the <b>debrief.</b> <b>Expert</b> faculty may bring more advanced pedagogic strategies and improve the Simulation experience. An improved staffing level for courses is another potential benefit. As technology advances existing equipment is left looking old and out-of-date. This may result in Simulation Centres becoming derelict spaces with expensive equipment and inadequate staffing. A Centralized approach may be more cost-effective resulting in a smaller number of high quality specialist centres. Cons: Disadvantages may include poorer access to simulation sessions. The courses delivered may not cater {{to the needs of the}} candidate as faculty may not understand local and cultural problems within the institute in which he works. A question arises of who would fund the service. Would each course obtain funding separately or would each specialty division obtain their own funding for training? Other options would include charity funding or each centre could obtain their own funding. However, this source of funding is uncertain and may result in an inconsistent service. Conclusion: Medical Simulation is integral to the training of clinical staff but the service is currently unequal across London. Centralization of services may improve the quality of the service but may also reduce access to these valuable training sessions. </p...|$|R
40|$|A good ship {{design is}} one that takes account of socio-technical {{requirements}} and challenges; it has to fulfil the fundamental requirements of the safety, efficiency, and usability of the entire ship system by keeping Human Factors (HF) in mind. Human Centred Design (HCD) is an approach which designers can use to apply HF and user involvement into ship design. Thus the ship designers’ expertise on HCD {{is of paramount importance}} for a good ship design. This paper presents part of an ongoing research study to integrate HCD knowledge into the maritime design engineering education. A “Designers Meet Users” workshop was conducted with Bachelor of Engineering students at Australian Maritime College. A team of seven maritime field experts were present as end users to provide HF feedback to improve final year ‘Design Projects’ done by the students. Students facilitated a walkthrough of their designs to the field experts. Data collection included <b>debriefing</b> meeting with <b>experts,</b> student feedback, and researchers’ observations. Field expert team highlighted the possible design alterations within the general arrangement and other layout drawing to make the designs more user friendly than its original, indicating that the students had little or no HF knowledge or experience. Thus it is needed to integrate HF/HCD knowledge into maritime design engineering education system in a more targeted engineering-oriented fashion...|$|R
40|$|Since {{four years}} the German Aerospace Centre (DLR, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) reorganizes its {{knowledge}} 		 management processes. In the project 		 "Establishing an integrated knowledge 		 management system" (EIWis) critical knowledge gaps 		 become identified. By asking the employees in a 		 survey about knowledge management a main problem was 		 clearly identified: the leaving expert issue. There 		 are various situations why experts are leaving. In 		 an academic environment like DLR, for instance, 		 doctoral students leave after graduation. But 		 leaving employees always leave {{with the knowledge}} 		 they have achieved. Each case means a specific 		 relationship between the expert and the 		 organization, while the expert is leaving and after 		 departure. This shows the necessity for different 		 approaches for knowledge sharing. A comprehensive 		 knowledge perspective can help to avoid problems 		 when an expert is leaving, but cannot replace the 		 engagement with the subject. Together with the 		 human resources department EIWis developed a 		 transfer process for leaving employees. After 		 intensive testing three main components were chosen 		 for the knowledge transfer at DLR: <b>Expert</b> 		 <b>Debriefing,</b> Story Telling and the Computer-based 		 Knowledge Transfer. In addition, a Lessons Learned 		 research project at DLR debriefs project members 		 about their experiences in multidisciplinary 		 projects. The results indicate relevant 		 circumstances and actions that support knowledge 		 transfer through collaboration. An overview of the 		 different approaches for knowledge transfer when 		 experts are leaving will be given...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Poor {{teamwork}} {{leads to}} preventable medical errors, and thus negatively impacts medical care. One {{way to improve}} teamwork is training. A multimodality team training program was designed to impact the attitudes and behavior of first-year residents who will encounter medical situations in the trauma room. The training program included low-fidelity role plays, lectures, and high-fidelity simulation with feedback. Materials and Methods: The training program was a one-day workshop that was conducted twice, once {{for each of the}} two groups over two days {{at the beginning of the}} academic year in July. A total of 41 first-year interns (10 Emergency Medicine and 31 Surgery) were recruited for participation. Participants completed a Situational judgment test (SJT) on trauma teamwork before training. The training began with a low-fidelity simulation that served as an icebreaker to team concepts. Subsequently, a lecture with discussion provided key points regarding teamwork in the trauma room. A high-fidelity simulation then allowed participation in one of four trauma room scenarios with medical <b>expert</b> <b>debriefing.</b> The course concluded with a course summary and an assessment of participant attitudes regarding training along with a second administration of SJT. Results: Participant reactions to the training were positive overall. Results of SJT showed a positive effect for team training in three of the four possible comparisons. Conclusion: The program was well received by the residents. Results suggest that a comprehensive training approach using role play, lecture, and simulation can positively affect behavioral choices for teamwork in the trauma room...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{critically}} review what is felt to be important about the role of debriefing in the field of simulation-based learning, how it has come about and developed over time, and the different styles or approaches that are used and how effective the process is. A recent systematic review of high fidelity simulation literature identified feedback (including debriefing) as the most important feature of simulation-based medical education. 1 Despite this, there are surprisingly few papers in the peer-reviewed literature to illustrate how to debrief, how to teach or learn to debrief, what methods of debriefing exist and how effective they are at achieving learning objectives and goals. This review is by no means a systematic review of all the literature available on debriefing, and contains information from both peer and nonpeer reviewed sources such as meeting abstracts and presentations from within the medical field and other disciplines versed in the practice of debriefing such as military, psychology, and business. It also contains many examples of what expert facilitators have learned over years of practice in the area. We feel this would be of interest to novices in the field as an introduction to <b>debriefing,</b> and to <b>experts</b> to illustrate the gaps that currently exist, which might be addressed in further research within the medical simulation community and in collaborative ventures between other disciplines experienced in the art of debriefing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Simulation {{experience}} alone without debriefing {{is insufficient}} for learning. Standardized multimedia instruction {{has been shown}} to be useful in teaching surgical skills but has not been evaluated for use as an adjunct in crisis management training. Our primary purpose in this study was to determine whether standardized computer-based multimedia instruction is effective for learning, and whether the learning is retained 5 wk later. Our secondary purpose was to compare multimedia instruction to personalized video-assisted oral <b>debriefing</b> with an <b>expert.</b> METHODS: Thirty anesthesia residents were recruited to manage three different simulated resuscitation scenarios using a high-fidelity patient simulator. After the first scenario, subjects were randomized to either a computer-based multimedia tutorial or a personal debriefing of their performance with an expert and videotape review. After their respective teaching, subjects managed a similar posttest resuscitation scenario and a third retention test scenario 5 wk later. Performances were independently rated by two blinded expert assessors using a previously validated assessment system. RESULTS: Posttest (12. 22 +/- 2. 19, P = 0. 009) and retention (12. 80 +/- 1. 77, P < 0. 001) performances of nontechnical skills were significantly improved in the standardized multimedia instruction group compared with pretest (10. 27 +/- 2. 10). There were no significant differences in improvement between the two methods of instruction. CONCLUSION: Computer-based multimedia instruction is an effective method of teaching nontechnical skills in simulated crisis scenarios and may be as effective as personalized oral debriefing. Multimedia may be a valuable adjunct to centers when debriefing expertise is not available...|$|R
40|$|Health care {{professionals}} are increasingly {{aware of the}} impact of cancer and cancer treatment on sexuality and intimacy, which are important components of quality of life until death. However, professionals are struggling with addressing these issues with cancer patients and their partners (clients). One of the reasons is lack of in-depth knowledge of clients’ experiences. Aims of the study •	To increase understanding of how cancer and cancer treatment impact upon the experience of sexuality and intimacy of patients and their partners •	To increase understanding of how cancer patients and their partners experience the way health {{care professionals}} address sexuality and intimacy •	To gain insight into health care professional’s perceptions of their role regarding sexuality and intimacy for cancer patients and their partners •	To develop patient driven models, tools and recommendations to acknowledge sexuality and intimacy in cancer and palliative care Methodology Using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, data were collected in the Netherlands through interviewing 8 patients, 7 couples and 6 partners of patients affected by cancer, and 20 health care professionals working in cancer and palliative care. Analysis was based on the hermeneutic circle, moving from the whole to the parts and back, and was enhanced by the use of ATLAS. ti, by peer <b>debriefing</b> and by <b>expert</b> consultation. Findings Findings are based on multiple perspectives and are presented in a storyline using vignettes. The core theme of the findings is ‘worlds apart’, manifesting itself on several levels: between clients and professionals, between partners and on the intrapsychic level of the patient. Cancer and cancer treatment impact on sexual function, sexual relationship and sexual identity, resulting in a unique outcome for every client or couple. Most participants reported that health care professionals did not address sexuality and intimacy, and attempts made often did not match participants’ preferences. Most participants said they would value discussing the impact of cancer on their sexuality and intimacy. This does require a ‘personalized’ approach from the health care professional {{from the start of the}} interaction with the patient onwards. Based on the findings of this study and the available literature, a systemic client driven model (the BLISSS communication model) and an integral team approach (model of stepped skills) were developed. Conclusions and recommendations All types of cancer and cancer treatment potentially have an enormous adverse and enduring impact on sexuality and intimacy. Therefore, sexuality and intimacy should be put on the agenda of health care education and of every cancer and palliative care team. Both personal factors and lack of guidance hinder professionals in addressing sexuality and intimacy. Using the stepped skills team approach, team members can develop clear and complementing roles in order to properly address sexuality and intimacy issues, resulting in adequate support for clients in all sexual domains: sexual functioning, sexual relationship and sexual identity. Team members should be trained to develop the competencies matching their role...|$|R
