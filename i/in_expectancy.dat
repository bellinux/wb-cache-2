40|$|The present article analyzed, how {{need for}} {{cognition}} (NFC) influences {{the formation of}} performance expectancies. When processing information, individuals with lower NFC often rely on salient information and shortcuts compared to individuals higher in NFC. We assume that these preferences of processing will also make individuals low in NFC more responsive to salient achievement-related cues because the processing of salient cues is cognitively less demanding than the processing of non-salient cues. Therefore, individuals lower in NFC should tend to draw wider ranging inferences from salient achievement-related information. In a sample of N = 197 secondary school students, achievement-related feedback (grade on an English examination) affected changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects (e. g., expectation of final grade in mathematics or history) when NFC was lower, whereas for students with higher NFC, changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects were not affected...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to partition the change <b>in</b> US life <b>expectancy</b> into those major causes of death and age groups that contributed most to the decline <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for Black males and females and to the increase <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for White males and females in the period from 1984 through 1989. METHODS. By means of a life table partitioning technique, the positive and negative contributions of age and cause of death to changes <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> were estimated. RESULTS. Causes contributing most to the decrease <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for Black males included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (or = 85 years of age). CONCLUSIONS. Mortality trends between the two major race groups in the United States diverged sharply, and without precedent, during the late 1980 s.

" The gender difference was analyzed by decomposition method, including age-specific decomposition and cause-specific decomposition. Women lived much longer than men in Chinese urban areas, with remarkable gains <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> since 2005, respectively. The gender difference reached a peak in 2007.

The contribution of cancers to the gender gap reduced over time, mostly influenced by the narrowing effect of liver cancer on gender gap. Traffic accidents and suicide were the external causes influencing the gender gap, contributing 10 - 16 % of the overall difference.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the contribution from specific {{causes of death}} to the changes <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> at birth <b>in</b> Denmark relative to Sweden in different age groups during the 1980 s and to compare the difference <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> {{between the two countries}} in 1990. DESIGN: Mortality data from WHO mortality tapes grouped in smaller series of clinically meaningful categories were used to calculate the contribution of each of these categories at each 10 year age group to the difference <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> at birth <b>in</b> each country between 1979 and 1990 and between the two countries. SETTING: Denmark and Sweden. RESULTS: Between 1979 and 1990 life <b>expectancy</b> increased <b>in</b> both Denmark and Sweden. However, the increase in Sweden was more than two years while that in Denmark was less than one year. In both countries a decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed most to the increase <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> males as well as females. In both sexes the smaller increase <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> Denmark was a result of differences in mortality trends in cardiovascular diseases and respiratory and non-respiratory cancers.
