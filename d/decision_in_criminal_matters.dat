40|$|The {{criminal}} warrant {{represents a}} specific form of <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>matters</b> and {{a type of}} simplified procedure as well. A single judge can issue a criminal warrant without trying the matter in the main trial if the facts are substantiated by reliable evidence. The criminal warrant has {{the nature of a}} convicting judgment. This type of simplified procedure is enacted under provisions § 314 e to § 314 g of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The criminal warrant is used in practice very often for its fastness and economy. In 2012, single judges by means of a criminal warrant, decided on 54, 64 % of criminal cases (accused) before the District Courts within the whole area of the Czech Republic. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the criminal warrant in all its aspects. The thesis is composed of nine chapters. Chapter One describes the history of the criminal warrant from 1918. Chapter Two focuses on relations between the criminal warrant and the basic principles of criminal procedure. Chapter Three describes the criminal warrant as a specific form of <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>matters,</b> procedure and conditions for issuing a criminal warrant, the penalties that can be imposed by means of a criminal warrant and the position of a victim. Chapter Four concentrates on the criminal warrant as a special method of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the actual {{problems}} of the coordination activity of Ukrainian prosecution agencies {{in the fight against}} crime, which require urgent solution. They include insufficient legal support of the coordination activity of prosecution agencies; inadequate level of methodological developments regarding these issues; implementation by prosecutors of only a few directions and forms of the coordination activity; inadequate organization of the coordination activity; absence of effective criteria to assess its effectiveness. At the same time, the coordination activity of prosecution agencies is regarded as a component of criminological function of prosecution agencies. Attention is drawn to the fact that criminological function, which is not directly enshrined in the legislation of Ukraine but is immanent to all activities of prosecution agencies that include maintenance of public prosecution, representation, supervision over compliance with laws by the agencies of inquiry and pre-trial investigation, supervision over the implementation of laws in the execution of judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>matters,</b> and coordination...|$|R
40|$|The chapter revisits the {{innovations}} {{introduced by the}} Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) {{and the establishment of}} an EU-wide system of free movement of judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>matters,</b> covering both pre-sentence and final decisions, within an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. It focuses upon the functionality of the principle of mutual recognition and identifies certain problem areas that limit the substantive scope of the EAW. The chapter first examines the two major reforms introduced by the Framework Decision, namely the abolition of the ‘double criminality’ test and the limited grounds for refusal of execution, especially the rule against surrendering nationals. It is argued that such a refusal cannot now rest on any human rights considerations, despite its constitutional premise in a number of cases. The chapter also provides a commentary on the paradox that, while the Framework Decision dispenses with verification of the double criminality test for the categories of listed offences, it leaves the definition of those offences (and the penalties applicable in each case) to the issuing Member State. And in accordance with the Framework Decision, the Member State must respect fundamental rights as enshrined in Article 6 TEU as well as the principle of legality. Konstadinides argues that ‘mutual recognition’ does not necessarily imply mutual trust...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} extent to which the {{development}} of instruments that implement the principle of mutual recognition of judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>matters,</b> particularly the European arrest warrant (EAW), may be considered valuable tools for effectively combating cross-border crime in the European Union. In addition, we assess how these policy orientations may or may not overcome the persistent mistrust and lack of confidence among the member states, while at the same time respecting human rights and civil liberties. In particular, this paper analyses: 1. EU judicial cooperation <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> matters: does it fight and prevent cross-border crime effectively in the EU? 2. The European arrest warrant – is it an improved method to replace extradition? Does the EAW provide a better solution to the practical complexities and difficulties that characterise the current extradition system? What are the inherent gaps in the proposed new surrender procedure under the EAW? 3. Does the EAW guarantee a good balance between efficiency and judicial protection of the individual’s fundamental rights? Does the Green Paper on procedural safeguards for suspect sand defendants <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> proceedings throughout the EU provide the right way forward? Does the EAW involve a real risk to the legal position and human rights of suspected individuals? 4. What is the added value of EU judicial cooperation against cross-border crime...|$|R
