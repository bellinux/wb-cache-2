5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|John {{remained}} Lord of Ireland {{throughout his}} reign. He {{drew on the}} country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased {{the size of his}} lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.|$|E
25|$|McCreery {{regarded}} Montgomery as excessively cautious, {{and indeed}} some historians {{have suggested that}} Montgomery failed to press home his advantage after the Battle of Alamein {{to the extent that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> (see, for example, Corelli Barnett, The Desert Generals).|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou comest not out {{upon the}} sea, Mercedes, {{contrary}} to thine own wishes?" [...] demanded Luis, with the earnest quickness {{of one who}} was fearful <b>he</b> <b>might</b> unconsciously <b>have</b> <b>done</b> an act of indiscretion.|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend {{suggested}} that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. Indeed, it seems natural, considering my dear boy's desire {{to enter the}} army, {{and the number of}} soldiers, who are always passing through this town." ...|$|R
60|$|Without the {{incentive}} of Mrs. MacAnder's words <b>he</b> <b>might</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Without their incentive and the accident of finding his wife's door for once unlocked, which had {{enabled him to}} steal upon her asleep.|$|R
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and was relieved for it. Lucas believed {{that if he had}} pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{attracted}} ridicule. He {{was strongly}} criticised by “The Morning Post” (“a costly blunder for which Mr W. Churchill {{must be held}} responsible”) while Admiral Beatty wrote to his wife that Churchill had been “a darned fool” and “mad”. Asquith wrote to Venetia Stanley likening Churchill to a tiger which has “tasted blood” and who was hinting that he wanted other opportunities for a major field command, and that he preferred military glory to political success. By 13 October Asquith was writing of “the wicked folly of it all” and that Churchill had led “sheep to the shambles”. He faced criticism for his poor judgement from his wife Clementine (he missed {{the birth of his}} daughter Sarah), and in his later writing conceded that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things differently.The Dunkirk force was also wound up after others, including Asquith, grew irritated about it.|$|E
25|$|Born in London but {{brought up}} in West Wales, Evans joined Glamorgan in the mid 1950s and became first-choice wicketkeeper after the {{retirement}} of Haydn Davies {{at the end of}} the 1958 season. For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{found the}} all-night lunchroom without much trouble, and entering, {{he sat down}} at one of the {{numerous}} tables. He was a well-read boy, and therefore did not appear as [...] "green" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R

50|$|After the 2006-07 season, Brown did not re-sign {{with the}} Bulls and {{rejected}} offers from several teams {{interested in his}} services, citing <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>done</b> with his career. He went into semi-retirement while contemplating a possible return, lasting considerably into the 2007-08 season.|$|R
25|$|Born 1 October 1900 in Gloucester, Goddard joined Gloucestershire in 1922 as a fast bowler, Goddard {{met with}} so little success in his first six years {{that he was not}} re-engaged by Gloucestershire for 1928. However, {{determined}} to succeed, he joined the ground staff at Lord's and switched to off spin. With his massive hands and steep bounce due to his height (about 190 centimetres or six feet three inches), he was an immediate success and Gloucestershire re-engaged him for 1929. Even on the best of wickets Goddard was able to turn the ball substantially, and when the turf was worn or sticky he could spin to a remarkable degree. He earned a reputation as a voracious appealer, a sworn enemy of batsmen. Owing to his high trajectory, he could be easy to hit (it is estimated he was hit for 70 sixes a season between 1934 and 1938), and it is probable that this is why he was so expensive against the incomparable 1948 Australian side, and in some cases in county cricket. He played only once against Australia (in 1930) and only eight times against all countries – for much of Goddard's time, Hedley Verity was the preferred England spin bowler, and it is often thought that leg spinners rather than off spinners were favoured at this time in Tests. His successes in the matches he played (he did a hat-trick against South Africa in 1938–39) suggests <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> well with more opportunities. He finished with six hat-tricks, the same as Parker and only one less than the all-time record of seven, held by D. V. P. Wright of Kent.|$|E
500|$|American Rifleman reported, [...] "There was no Pawnee wife or {{children}} to motivate him, no real cause for revenge, either, as {{he understood that}} Jim Bridger and John Fitzgerald honestly thought he {{was as good as}} dead. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same thing if their roles were reversed. The one constant in every telling of the tale until “The Revenant” opened was Hugh Glass wanted his gun back." [...] The reporting about this story indicates that Glass did track down Fitzgerald and demand the rifle's return, which Fitzgerald sullenly complied with.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
6000|$|That's {{the worst}} of a life with a mystery in it--he was much alarmed. It was very likely {{that the man had}} seen him before--worse luck to his {{excellent}} memory. Bunter himself could not be expected to remember every casual dock walloper <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do</b> with. Bunter brazened it out by turning upon the man, making use of that impressive, black-as-night sternness of expression his unusual hair furnished him with: ...|$|R
60|$|It was here, or near to this, just above, on the hill-side, if our {{topography}} be reliable, that Jesus {{asked them}} {{whether they could}} not watch one hour. Bertram, as he passed, {{did not take the}} question to himself; but <b>he</b> well <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|R
50|$|Roll Call also {{reported}} that Abramoff himself attended one of Santorum's meetings in 2001. Santorum says <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> attended but <b>does</b> not specifically recall that.|$|R
2500|$|In a [...] "Lettre à Mlle Cousinot sur l'histoire de France et le choix des historiens" [...] he {{explained}} why {{the writing of}} history was {{to be more than}} the [...] "amateur" [...] collection of dates and anecdotes related to old coins (numismatics) and stones: The knowledge of history pertained to a distinct moral character of society. Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, could be instructive on related measures in the present— how to do things better or worse. Sometimes we want to know not only what a historical figure has done, but by what right <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so differently.|$|E
2500|$|At that time, it was {{customary}} {{for children}} to receive their First Communion {{at the age of}} twelve. (Pope Pius X would later lower this age to seven) After initial hesitation, and subsequent consultation with other priests, the parish priest agreed to permit Dominic to receive his First Communion at the age of seven, since he knew the catechism and understood something of the Eucharist. He spent much time praying and reading in preparation, asking his mother's forgiveness for anything <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to displease her and then went to Church. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco devotes a chapter to tell of Dominic's First Communion. He says that several years later, whenever Dominic talked of the day of his First Communion, he said with joy: ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1978, {{staff at}} a {{facility}} for problem pupils, to which Spencer had been referred for truancy, informed her parents {{that she was}} suicidal. That summer, Spencer, who was known to hunt birds in the neighborhood, was arrested for shooting out the windows of Cleveland Elementary with a BB gun, and burglary. In December, a psychiatric evaluation arranged by her probation officer recommended Spencer be admitted to a mental hospital for depression, but her father refused to give permission. For Christmas 1978, {{he gave her a}} Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic [...]22 caliber rifle with a telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition. Spencer later said, [...] "I asked for a radio and he bought me a gun." [...] When asked why <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that, she answered, [...] "I felt like he wanted me to kill myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Independent {{said it was}} a 'riveting book...enough to {{make your}} jaw drop... without judgement, refusing to descend into anti-gun rhetoric, {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>done</b> given the shocking revelations throughout... This book is more than just facts, it’s insight and revelation on a very human level.' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the battle}} about the {{correspondence}} was {{explained to him}} by his wife, it, of course, became necessary to him to give his orders to his daughter. Such a matter could hardly be passed over in silence,--though <b>he</b> probably <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not been instigated to action by the Marchioness.|$|R
60|$|The rain {{came down}} by the bucketful, {{and it did not}} take much to soak him to the skin. There was no way of {{protecting}} himself; he must take it as it came. Fortunately it was warm, so he did not suffer so much as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hick {{began the}} 1998 season slowly and was {{left out of}} the England team {{at the start of the}} year, but he responded with four {{hundreds}} in successive first-class innings in late May and early June. Although this form left him somewhat thereafter, he was nevertheless selected for the final two Tests against South Africa. A total of nine runs from three innings left his hopes of a place on the Ashes tour looking extremely shaky, but after two half-centuries in ODIs and then 107 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka it seemed <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> just enough. However, his century was outshone by John Crawley's 156 in the same innings and in the end it was the Lancashire man who got the nod. Hick was left at home, to console himself with the memory of the adulation of the Worcestershire crowd: in May at New Road he had made his hundredth first-class century.|$|E

6000|$|Biarne, who was {{not aware}} of the {{consequences}} of what he had said in jest, felt inclined to laugh, but he checked himself and flushed somewhat, not being accustomed to be addressed in such haughty tones.

60|$|But Charley cannot {{any longer}} be {{called one of}} the Cottage circle. It was now the end of October, and since the day of his arrest, he had not yet been there.

6000|$|Although {{sufficiently}} {{acquainted with}} the unceremonious habits {{of the people of}} the country to feel no surprise at this intrusion, Paul was vexed at having his tête à tête with Eve so rudely broken; and he answered with more of the hauteur of the quarterdeck than <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> by saying coldly-- ...|$|R

60|$|Harry's sadness was gone, but {{he still}} was guarded and gentle during the few days that followed; {{he seemed to have}} learned thought, and in his {{gratitude}} for the privileges he had so nearly missed, to rate them more highly than <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> Indeed, the doubt for the Sunday gave him a sense of probation.|$|R
60|$|I have, indeed,' said he, {{simply and}} gravely; {{and there was}} a silence, while she was certain that, {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> endured, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel it to have been in vain.|$|R
