25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{on these}} {{studies showed that}} males with an enlarged prostate urinated better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> position compared to the standing. The amount of residual urine in the bladder was significantly reduced, {{and there was a}} trend towards a more powerful flow and shorter voiding time. Combined, this reduces the risk of bladder stones and urinary tract infections. The same study showed that healthy males were not influenced by position, meaning that they could urinate in either position.|$|E

25|$|This {{example of}} Gothic Revival {{architecture}} is particularly noteworthy for its exterior trim details. Typically, the gable ends, at the edges, feature curvilinear (or gingerbread-type) vergeboards in residential Gothic Revival styled buildings. The Lake–Peterson House has simple pointed arches with ornamented pendants. The windows are also somewhat unusual in their variety. Three of the home's four sides have bay windows and other windows are topped by limestone hood molds. The windows themselves show differing forms as well, including the double-hung sash {{windows on the}} second floor and the diamond-paned windows with colored glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> room.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E

The human remains were dated to between 2,500 BC to 800 AD, indicating some sort of indigenous peoples' presence at High Park. The remains were coated in hematite red powdery substance in the custom of the Red Paint People who lived in New England and Atlantic Canada. The site is also similar to the Red Ocher people indigenous people who made burials in sandy ridges.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound {{is the size of}} a small horse and appears from the depths of Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E

His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives.

He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Winter Paralympics para-alpine skiing {{events were}} held at Whistler Creekside. The {{disciplines}} at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom and Giant Slalom.

In the Downhill event, there were 25 men and 18 women in the standing class, 25 men and 10 women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> class and 12 men and 10 women in the vision impaired class. In the super-combined, there were 18 men and 14 women for standing, 18 men and 10 women for sitting and 10 men and 10 women for vision impaired. The Slalom race had the shortest course length of the major para-alpine events at the Games. The Downhill was held for both men and women in all classes on day 2.

500|$|The Danebod Folk School {{was first}} {{built in the}} year 1888, but it {{burned to the ground}} on February25, 1917. It was soon rebuilt, and nine months later the current school {{building}} was completed. A three-story brick building, it has gable ends carried up as parapets. The four-story crenelated corner tower and the pointed arches at the entrance are from Gothic and native Danish architecture. The Folk School was renovated in 1946 and is now used by the Danebod Lutheran Church for camps and retreats, and as a meeting place for local groups and clubs. Points of interest are the hand-carved podium in the lecture hall, the picture behind the podium, the hand-carved wooden cross on the podium, collection plates made by Dr.Thomsen, and also the statuary in the lecture hall and sitting rooms, pictures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> rooms, and the small podium in the dining room. Early settlers of the colony founded a residential school in the Danish tradition of folk High Schools and fostered the concept of [...] "learning for living", by which individuals sought to become enlightened and thoughtful citizens. The Folk School Building stands as a testament to these values, and continues to serve as a place for fellowship and lifelong learning. Each dormitory style room is unique in plan and decoration. A large kitchen and dining area provide a perfect setting for group meals and activities. A lecture hall and several classrooms allow ample space for programming.|$|E
