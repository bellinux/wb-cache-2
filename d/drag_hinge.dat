25|$|A {{crash in}} February 1926, caused by blade root failure, {{led to an}} {{improvement}} in rotor hub design.

2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere.

50|$|The Avro built C.8 was a {{refinement}} of the C.6, {{with the more}} powerful 180hp Lynx radial engine, and several C.8s were built. The C.8R incorporated drag hinges, due to blade flapping motion causing high blade root stresses in the rotor plane of rotation; this modification, however, resulted in other problems such as ground resonance for which <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers were fitted.|$|E
5000|$|A {{semi-rigid}} rotorhead {{does not}} have individual flapping or <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> but provides for flapping and lag motion through gimbal mounting. [...] A common example of a semi-rigid rotor is a teetering rotorhead found on the Robinson family of helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then declutched. The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|R
50|$|The Gyroplane was a two-seat {{autogyro}} without wings, with a {{ducted fan}} pusher propeller {{driven by a}} 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 piston engine. It had a three bladed rotor, formed from bonded aluminium. There were flapping <b>hinges</b> but no <b>drag</b> <b>hinges.</b> In normal flight the rotor was undriven, but the design team were keen to enable vertical jump starts, an autogyro technique which spins up the rotor before take off without forward movement over the ground. The first prototype used conspicuous tip jets fed directly with compressed air from a fuselage mounted cylinder.|$|R

50|$|Ground {{resonance}} {{is usually}} precipitated by a hard landing or an asymmetrical ground contact, {{and is more}} likely to occur when components of the landing gear or damping system are improperly maintained, such as the <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers, oleo struts, or wheel tire pressure. Under extreme conditions, the initial shock can cause violent oscillations that quickly build and result in catastrophic damage of the entire airframe. In some cases, complete destruction occurs, e.g. body panels, fuel tanks, and engines are torn away, even at normal rotor speed.|$|E
5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or <b>drag</b> <b>hinge,</b> allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the <b>drag</b> <b>hinge.</b> The purpose of the <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need <b>drag</b> <b>hinges.</b> The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|R
50|$|Articulated rotor {{systems with}} <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> allow each {{individual}} blade to advance or lag in its rotation {{to compensate for}} stress on the blade caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the rotor hub (due to momentum conservation). When the spacing of the blades becomes irregular, it shifts the rotor's center of gravity from the axis of rotation, which causes an oscillation. When the airframe begins to rock {{back and forth from}} the oscillation, the oscillations can reinforce each other and cause the rotor's center of gravity to spiral away from the axis of rotation to a point beyond the compensating ability of the damping system.|$|R
50|$|It was an {{amphibian}} with retractable {{wheels on}} cranked axles with rearward <b>drag</b> struts <b>hinged</b> from the fuselage sides and with near-vertical shock absorber legs. Other struts facilitated {{the raising of}} the wheels above the waterline but no details are known.|$|R

50|$|The C.40 was {{the last}} {{autogyro}} produced by the Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd. Design commenced in July 1936 and continued after Cierva's death in an airliner crash in December of that year. Based on the C.30A Autogiro the C.40 was originally intended to use a higher power version of the Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major engine. Utilizing the lessons of autodynamic rotor development underway since 1933, the C.40 rotor included three flexible blades to suppress vibration and were attached to the rotor hub through inclined flap and <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> to give jump-takeoff capability. It had two side-by-side seats in a wooden fuselage and the production version was powered by a Salmson 9NG radial engine, problems with which delayed introduction of the C.40 into service until mid-1938.|$|R

50|$|The LeO H-23-2 was an amphibious {{aircraft}} {{with conventional}} tailwheel landing gear. Each wheel, fitted with low pressure tyres and brakes, {{was on a}} cranked axle with a <b>drag</b> strut, both <b>hinged</b> from the hull side, and another leg which was vertical when the gear was down; the fuselage hinge also mounted an inverse V-strut, its vertex {{on the top of}} the vertical leg. All three joined the bottom end of an oblique Messier retracting shock absorber which projected inwards above the wing. Retracted, the wheel was exposed under the wing, at about 30° to it.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the aerodynamic performance of vortex flaps on a 75 -deg sweep delta wing has been conducted in the NASA Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers from 1. 7 to 2. 8. The sharp leading edge vortex flaps consisted of the outboard 30 percent of the local wing semispan. Flap deflections of 0, 5, 10, and 15 deg were investigated, for both a wing-alone and a wing-body configuration. The flaps were effective in reducing the drag across the lift-coefficient range. Integration of the upper surface pressure distributions showed that the suction pressures induced by the vortex on the flap {{were responsible for the}} drag reductions. At some lift conditions, the minimum <b>drag</b> condition permitted <b>hinge</b> line separation or vortex migration inboard of the hinge line. This result is in contrast to subsonic results, where optimum conditions call for no hinge line separation. The magnitude of the drag reduction due to flap deflection generally decreased as Mach number increased. The effect of a cylindrical forebody on the drag reduction due to flap deflection was minimal...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of reducing control surface input power {{with the use of}} a tab-assisted flap. Wind tunnel tests were conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) on a NACA 3415 airfoil model with a flap including a trim tab. Measurements were taken for two configurations: a baseline fixed tab case where tab deflection was zero and a tabbed case where multiple flap and tab angle combinations were tested. Hinge moment measurements were taken for both the flap and tab for comparison between the two cases. In addition; lift, drag and moment measurements along with surface pressures were acquired to aid in the analysis of the concept and provide flow diagnostics. The data were compared to computational results which compared well with the exception of flap and tab deflection cases where large regions of unsteady separated flow were present. All data were taken at a Reynolds number of 1. 8 million and Mach number of 0. 18. To analyze the power-savings capability of a tab-assisted flap, several studies were conducted: a generalized tab performance study evaluating hinge moment reduction and a quasidynamic study using the static data to calculate work savings for two simulated flap deflections. The generalized tab performance study revealed large hinge moment reductions for each of the flap deflections when using the tab to actuate the flap. These reductions came at the cost of increased drag, reduced lift and loss of flap effectiveness. The quasi-dynamic study produced significantly large work savings for both simulated flap deflection schedules. Even though this study ignored the effect on lift and drag, as well as the unsteady aerodynamics and control surface inertia, it suggests the large power-savings potential of a tab-assisted flap. A flow visualization analysis was performed to further assess the loss of flap effectiveness observed in the tab performance calculations as well as the non-linear behavior in the lift, <b>drag</b> and <b>hinge</b> moment data. The results of the analysis showed the complex flowfield behavior in cases where the flap and tab deflections were of opposite sign and larger magnitude and identified the cause of behavior in other cases where data non-linearities existed...|$|R
40|$|This study obtains {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the aerodynamics of integrated trailing edge flap (TEF) based swashplateless rotors. Both two dimensional (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) analysis/simulations are performed to understand the behavior of TEF airfoils and integrated TEF based swashplateless rotors. The 2 D aerodynamics of TEF airfoils is explored in detail. A semi-empirical approach is developed for modeling drag for TEF airfoils in steady flows based on baseline airfoil drag data alone. Extensive 2 D CFD simulations are performed for a wide range of flow conditions in order to better understand various aspects of the aerodynamics of TEF airfoils. The trends in the airloads (lift, <b>drag,</b> pitching moment, <b>hinge</b> moment) for TEF airfoils are obtained. Nonlinear phenomena such as flow separation, shocks and unsteady vortex shedding are investigated, and the flow conditions and trends associated with them are studied. The effect of airfoil properties such as thickness and overhang are studied. Various approaches are used to model the effect of gaps at the leading edge of the flap. An approximate ``gap averaging'' technique is developed, which provides good predictions of steady airloads at almost the same computational cost as a simulation where the gap is not modeled. Direct modeling of the gap is done by using a patched mesh in the gap region. To solve problems (such as poor grid quality/control and poor convergence) that are associated with the patched mesh simulations, an alternate approach using overlapping meshes is used. It is seen that for TEF airfoils, the presence of gaps adversely affects the effectiveness of the flap. The change in airloads is not negligible, especially at the relatively higher flap deflections associated with swashplateless TEF rotors. Finally, uncoupled and coupled computational fluid/structural dynamics (CFD-CSD) simulations of conventional (baseline) and swashplateless TEF rotors is performed in hovering flight. The CFD-CSD code is validated against experiment and good agreement is observed. It is observed that the baseline UH- 60 rotor performs better than the swashplateless UH- 60 rotor. For an untwisted NACA 0012 airfoil based rotor, the performance is similar for the baseline and swashplateless configurations. The effect of gaps on the performance of swashplateless TEF rotors is also investigated. It is seen that the presence of chordwise gaps significantly affects the effectiveness of the TEF to control the rotor. Spanwise gaps also affect the performance of swashplateless rotors but their effect is not as significant...|$|R
