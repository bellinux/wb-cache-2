500|$|There was a {{temporary}} {{lull in the}} Jay Treaty furor after Washington signed it on August 24. The following year, however, it flared up again, when the House of Representatives inserted itself into the debate. This time the fight was not only over {{the merits of the}} treaty, but also about whether the House had the power under the Constitution to refuse to appropriate the money necessary for a treaty already ratified by the Senate and signed by the president. Citing its constitutional <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> (Article I, Section 7), the House requested that the president turn over all documents that related to the treaty, including his instructions to Jay, all correspondence, and all other documents relating to the treaty negotiations. He refused to do so, invoking what later became known as executive privilege, and insisted that the House did not have the Constitutional authority to block treaties. A contentious debate ensued, during which, Washington's most vehement opponents in the House {{went so far as to}} publicly call for his impeachment. Through it all, Washington responded to his critics by using his prestige, political skills, and the power of office in a sincere and straightforward fashion to broaden public support for his stance. On April 30, the House voted 51–48 to approve the requisite treaty funding. Jeffersonians carried their campaign against the treaty and [...] "pro-British Federalist policies" [...] into the political campaigns (both state and federal) of 1796, where the political divisions marking the First Party System became crystallized.|$|E

40|$|Central banking is {{understood}} in terms of the fiscal features of monetary, credit, and interest on reserves policies. Monetary policy - expanding reserves by buying Treasuries - transfers all revenue from money creation directly to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities.</b> Credit policy - selling Treasuries to fund loans or acquire non-Treasury securities - is debt-financed fiscal policy. Interest on reserves frees monetary policy to fund credit policy independently of interest rate policy. An ambiguous boundary of responsibilities between the Fed and the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities</b> contributed to economic collapse in fall 2008. "Accord" principles are proposed to clarify Fed credit policy powers and secure its independence on monetary and interest rate policy. The Fed needs more surplus capital from the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities</b> to be fully flexible against both inflation and deflation at the zero interest bound. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{searches}} {{for a general}} equilibrium model of optimal growth and endogenous fiscal policy {{with the aim of}} explaining the interaction between private agents and <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities</b> in the U.

40|$|The {{question}} that this paper examines is what policy bias {{there may be}} when monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities</b> have different preferences regarding the importance of closing the output and inflation gaps created by adverse economic shocks. For this purpose, the paper follows a game-theoretic approach to model the interaction between monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>authorities,</b> each having different preferences and controlling their respective policy instrument. Modeled as a Nash or Stackelberg equilibrium, the absence of policy coordination implies that {{an increase in the}} preference divergence between both authorities leads to, ceteris paribus, larger public deficits (the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority’s</b> policy instrument) and higher interest rates (the central bank’s instrument). The empirical section of the paper provides evidence in favor of this conclusion in a pooled sample of 19 industrial countries with annual information for the period 1970 - 94. The policy implication of the paper is that, without prejudice to the gains from central bank independence, institutional arrangements that allow for monetary-fiscal coordination may alleviate the biases that move the economy to sub-optimally higher fiscal deficits and real interest rates. ...|$|R
