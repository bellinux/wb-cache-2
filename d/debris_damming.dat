40|$|The {{failure of}} <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> {{impacted}} by the massive stones in a debris flow represents a difficult design problem. Reasonable materials selection and structural design can effectively improve the resistance impact performance of <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Based on the cushioning properties of expanded polystyrene (EPS) concrete, EPS concrete as a buffer layer poured {{on the surface of}} a rigid <b>debris</b> <b>dam</b> was proposed.

Two years after wood deposition, we surveyed individual pieces of LWD in one stream and surveyed <b>debris</b> <b>dam</b> locations in eight streams within the ice storm area. To examine the linear pattern of <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> within a stream, we used a one-dimensional version of Ripley’s K, a second-order statistic that evaluates the spatial pattern of points within a landscape. Both aggregated and segregated (regularly spaced) distributions of wood were identified. Individual pieces of LWD were aggregated at spatial extents ranging from 0 to 40 m and were segregated at spatial extents ranging from 80 to 100 m. In two streams, we found that <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> were segregated at distances ranging from 100 to 300 m relative to randomly chosen locations, but <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> showed no significant spatial pattern in six other study streams.

40|$|In forested, {{mountain}} landscapes where debris flows are common, their deposition commonly forms valley-spanning dams of wood, boulders, or complex {{mixtures of}} both in headwater valleys, and sediment impoundment behind these dams causes alluviation {{in what would}} otherwise be bedrock channels. In this paper, the effects of <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> {{on the evolution of}} headwater valley profiles over geologic time are examined. In the Oregon Coast Range, USA, longitudinal profiles of three headwater channels (approximately 2 sq. km maximum contributing area), two of which are nominally bedrock, and all <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> were surveyed. Channel and valley widths were measured, and surface bed material measurements (pebble counts) were taken at several locations along one stream. Cumulative relief in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> is highly variable within and among streams, reaching a maximum of 58 % of profile relief at one location. The surveyed dams comprise 9. 8 %, 19 %, and 6. 4 % of total basin relief in the three corresponding drainage basins, respectively. A model of bedrock erosion and channel profile evolution is derived that accounts for (a) fractional coverage by the channel of total valley width at any given time and (b) shielding by sediment impounded behind <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> The equation for incision rate, assumed constant, is solved for valley gradient as a function of contributing area...|$|R
40|$|In {{mountain}} region where sediment yield is very active, {{various kinds of}} sabo workshave been constructed to control or prevent sediment erosion, transportation and deposition. <b>Debris</b> <b>dam,</b> one of the typical sabo works, has functions inherently such as suppresion ofchannel erosion and sediment detension liable to flow out.

40|$|We {{examined}} seasonal {{and spatial}} linkages between N cycling and organic matter for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How do longitudinal NH 4 + uptake patterns vary seasonally {{and what is}} the effect of organic matter, stream size, transient storage and <b>debris</b> <b>dams?</b> We applied a longitudinal (stream channel corridor) approach in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments (adapted to account for the effect of nutrient saturation) covering 14 – 16 reaches, and compared two distinct seasons (late fall 2003 and late summer 2004). Longitudinal NH 4 + uptake rate patterns had a distinct seasonal reversal; fall had the highest uptake rates in the upper reaches, while summer had the highest uptake rates in the lower reaches. This seasonal reversal was attributed to organic matter and evidenced by DON patterns. Transient storage did not have an expected effect on uptake rates in fall because it was confounded by leaf litter; litter produced higher uptakes, but also may have reduced transient storage. In summer however, uptake rates had a positive correlation with transient storage. <b>Debris</b> <b>dams</b> had no distinct effect on uptake in fall because of their recent formation. In summer however, the <b>debris</b> <b>dam</b> effect was significant; although the <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> were hydraulically inactive then, the upstream reaches had 2 – 5 fold higher uptake rates.

40|$|Abstract. -The {{effects of}} woody debris on {{anadromous}} salmonid habitat in eight streams on Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska, were investigated by comparing low-gradient (1 - 9 %) first- or second-order streams flowing through either spruce-hemlock forests or 6 - 10 -year-old clearcuts, and by observing changes after debris was selectively removed from clear-cut reaches. Woody debris decreased {{the rate of}} shallowing as discharge decreased, thus helping to preserve living space for fish during critical low-flow periods. <b>Debris</b> <b>dams</b> were more frequent in clear-cut streams (14. 9 / 100 m), which contained more debris, than in forested streams (4. 2 / 100 m). As a result, total residual pool length (length when pools are filled with water {{but there is no}} flow) and length of channel with residual depth greater than 14 cm-the depth range occupied by 84 % of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) -were greater in clear-cut streams than in forested streams. Greater volumes of woody debris in clear-cut streams produced greater storage of fine sediment (< 4 -mm diameter) unless the stream gradient was sufficiently high to flush sediment from storage. One-half of the <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> broke up or were newly formed over a 3 -year period, which suggests that they usually released sediment and woody debris before the pools they formed were filled with sediment.

40|$|Since {{the arrival}} of humans {{approximately}} 1000 years before present (B. P.), New Zealand has lost approximately 80 % of its forest cover and along with it, the contribution of wood to our aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this thesis was to undertake a large catchment-scale assessment of LW loadings, spatial distribution and morphological influence in an old-growth indigenous forest to provide some understanding on the natural characteristics of wood {{that would have been}} present in many river systems of New Zealand prior to human settlement. The second component of the thesis involved the experimental removal of wood from three small streams in order to provide some insight into what that loss of wood may have meant for fish and aquatic invertebrate communities. In {{the first part of the}} study, a catchment scale survey of large wood (LW) was completed in a 5 thorder, old-growth forest river system. LW volumes ranged from 59 - 503 m³ ha⁻¹ and declined down the river system along with the number of LW pieces suspended across the channel and LW influence on channel morphology, whereas piece frequency, number of pieces in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> and length increased. Nearly half the pieces were influencing channel morphology, particularly wood accumulation, sediment storage, bank armouring, and pool formation. These key pieces were larger, longer and more stable than average. LW contribution to habitat complexity was highest in the middle to upper sections of the river system. Four key zones of wood distribution and influence were identified in the river system. Zonal boundaries were influenced by changes in transport capacity, fluvial processes and channel morphology. In the second part of the study, a field trial was established in three small forested streams to measure the influence of wood and its experimental removal on channel morphology, and indigenous fish and aquatic invertebrate communities. Prior to wood removal there were no significant differences in the total density of fish between wood pools (pools with wood cover), open pools and riffles. Total fish biomass was marginally significant with most of the fish biomass located in wood pools. At the species level, the density and biomass of banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus) and the weights of longfin eels (Anguilla dieffenbachii) were significantly higher in wood pools. Species richness, density and biomass of bluegill bullies (Gobiomorphus hubbsi), torrentfish (Cheimarrichthys fosteri) and the density of redfin bullies (Gobiomorphus huttoni) was highest in riffles. Differences in fish community composition were greatest between riffles and pools, whereas there was considerable overlap between the two pool types. Total invertebrate density was 70 % higher in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> than riffles prior to wood removal, but this difference was not significant. Densities of Trichoptera (caddisfly) and Plecoptera (stonefly), and five aquatic invertebrate taxa were significantly higher in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> which also contained greater numbers of less common taxa (< 1 % total catch) than riffles. Only Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera) densities were significantly higher in riffles than in <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Aquatic invertebrate communities in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> differed significantly from those in riffles and season had a significant influence on aquatic invertebrate community structure. Removal of wood and associated <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> from the treatment sections in each of the three streams resulted in a simplified channel morphology, significantly increasing the length and area in riffles and reducing the area of pools. The impact on the fish community was greatest for the two larger fish, banded kokopu and large longfin eels, whose abundance declined in the treatment sections. At the reach scale, only banded kokopu biomass showed a significant decline following wood removal. Invertebrates were less affected by wood removal and associated loss of <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Invertebrate composition in the remaining riffles in the treatment sections had a higher proportion of Ephemeroptera and lower proportions of Trichoptera, Plecoptera and Diptera with fewer rare species than remaining <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> in the control sections, but there were no discernable effects on invertebrate densities and functional feeding groups at the reach scale. Public perception of wood in waterways is mainly negative and wood is managed primarily to reduce flood damage in New Zealand’s streams. With continued research and advocacy on the environmental benefits, careful planning and judicial use, there is the potential to make better use of wood to rehabilitate and enhance New Zealand’s stream environments. This thesis provides some insight into the contribution of wood to forested stream ecosystems in New Zealand and the implicit losses associated with forest removal. It also contributes to our global understanding on the role of wood, its contribution to habitat heterogeneity and influence on biological communities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Retention of coarse {{particulate}} {{organic matter}} (CPOM) {{is essential to the}} efficient use of organic matter in streams supported by allochthonous inputs. To measure retention and to study factors affecting retention, we conducted both long-term and short-term experiments using small dowels as indices of stick retention and pieces of paper as indices of leaf retention. These experiments were done in streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. In general, we found that both types of CPOM were efficiently retained in all streams. Factors that affected CPOM transport and retention were storms, stream size, stream depth, and the abundance of retention structures in the streams. After initial transport, woody CPOM was transported only during storms. Retention was greater in smaller streams and in shallower stream sites. Rocks, boulders, and woody debris were the most important retention structures.
