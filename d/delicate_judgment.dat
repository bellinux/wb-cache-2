40|$|This {{working group}} report {{has been a}} mixture of {{privilege}} and pain: privilege to work with such a committed, engaged and high-quality group of colleagues from diverse arenas, not all of whom I knew beforehand,. I want to thank them all for their collegial commitment, well beyond their formal contractual obligations. However I reserve my most especial thanks for our rapporteur, Ulrike Felt, who has not only borne her full share of the writing and rewriting of several drafts, starting in summer 2006, but has also managed always to compensate for my rather indulgent academic chairing of our group's intense, mostly constructive but often difficult meetings, when I should have given pragmatism more influence. She always pulled us back on track, from the beginning right to the very end, and I am forever grateful to her for that. We convened {{for the first time}} in July 2005, and altogether met five times for about two days each at roughly four-monthly intervals. Initially we were assisted by Nicole Dewandre, who encouraged us very much to address the issue in a rather broad manner. She was replaced in September 2006 by Rene von Schomberg. On behalf of the group I thank both for helping us at the different stages of this work. Another Commission staff-member, Silvio Funtowicz, took part as an academically recognized expert in the field of our report, and we are also grateful to him not only for his own research and policy insights, but for sharing with us his long-standing experience of Commission preoccupations. I would also like to thank Michael Rogers giving us his response to an earlier draft in the light of his experiences as a senior European policy maker. None of these colleagues should be held responsible for any of the report's contents even if their advice was often influential. Our working process involved detailed debate over the nature of the problems in this domain, then production of working papers on topics identified. A further round of discussion and writing produced 'building blocks' which were almost provisional outlines of chapters. Summer 2006 saw a first full draft produced by Ulrike Felt and me, using these materials. Close to the production deadline, smaller 'specialist' informal sub-groups who had already produced topic working papers took on the task of redrafting specific chapters, sometimes radically, with each chapter going through at least three revisions. In this process there was a lot of interaction across the whole working group, during which we also agreed to restructure the overall draft in significant ways. Thus the final report is a group product to which everyone involved is able to sign up except Isabelle Stengers. I would nevertheless like to thank her for her contributions. Of course, in such a complex, highly-pressured, and unevenly collective enterprise this does not mean that everyone agrees with or is responsible for every word or argumentative form. Never before having presided over the collective production of what is a quite original and intellectually (not to mention politically) challenging document, but in a charged and multifarious policy context, and against a fixed deadline, I have learnt a lot. I deeply hope it was worth it. We were all convinced of the importance of the issues we were asked to address, and we spent many animated hours confronting each-other as to what we believe these issues to be. The pragmatic requirement to address policy audiences with what are complex and not always convergent ideas, itself leaves a <b>delicate</b> <b>judgment</b> as to how strongly to make our thoughts 'digestible' and 'accessible' to our anyway differentiated and not clearly-defined audiences. This also resonates with another strategic question about whether we look for immediate or longerterm impact. Although our group differed on these strategic questions, my own personal view is that if the sheer complexity of the issues and perspectives we introduce means th...|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} {{of being the}} community’s forum for criticism meant that the papers received letters that ranged in subject matter from a girl criticizing a boyfriend’s mother (which did get published) to calling out party officials on corruption. The editors then needed to make <b>delicate</b> <b>judgments</b> on what subjects to investigate in order to authenticate, and when to publish anonymously {{in order to protect}} the author from recrimination. Advice was even given to punish those who took revenge on the authors of published criticisms.|$|R
40|$|Teachers listen attentively to the {{classroom}} conversations in which their students engage. This often involves <b>delicate</b> <b>judgments</b> about whether to stay silent or intervene. Should I move the discussion along by asking a question or making a comment? Or would it be better to allow the conversation to continue, however awkwardly the students might be expressing their insights? Awkward or not, there is value in providing opportunities {{for young people to}} find the words they need in order to converse with one another in classroom settings, building on each other’s sentences in an effort to jointly construct meaning and reach understanding...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court has {{repeatedly}} noted that ballot and election regulations raise difficult {{questions about the}} interplay between the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s heightened protection for political speech, and states 2 ̆ 7 need to regulate ballots and elections to ensure fair and orderly democracy. When making the <b>delicate</b> <b>judgments</b> between protecting political speech and allowing states to regulate elections, the Court has traditionally stated precisely which test it was employing to evaluate individual restrictions. Last Term, in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, the Court invalidated several of Colorado 2 ̆ 7 s restrictions on the signature-gathering process for ballot initiative petitions. In so doing, the Court failed to identify which level of scrutiny it was applying {{for each of the}} restrictions in question and relied instead on certain unreviewed restrictions to render unconstitutional the specific regulations before it. The lack of clarity in the resulting opinion will make it difficult for lawmakers, lower courts, and the Court to create and evaluate election regulations...|$|R
50|$|Tootsie Roll-About a mile {{downstream}} from {{the conclusion of}} The Gate (Narrow Falls), Tootsie Roll appears. The rapid is mostly straightforward. Be aware of Cookie Monster at the end however. The two large, often submerged boulders here create two extremely powerful ledge holes. The holes may sneak up on boatmen that are not paying attention. There is a commonly used sneak run to river right. The alternative is to run the holes, which can be avoided at certain, specific levels by <b>delicate</b> maneuvering. This <b>judgment</b> call should {{be made by the}} boatman.|$|R
5000|$|The ballet {{probably}} suffered {{when the}} supposed collaboration between Nijinska and librettist Cocteau quickly collapsed. Issues contested included gender (Cocteau entertaining a [...] "dim view of women" [...] versus Nijinska's unease with traditional femininity), story and gesture verses 'abstract ballet' (Cocteau favored substituting out dance for pantomime), {{and the changing}} aesthetics of dance (Cocteau favoring acrobatics over dance, which for Nijinska was a <b>delicate</b> series of <b>judgments).</b> Garafola further opines that [...] "Only Nijinska had the technical wherewithal... to wrest irony from the language and traditions of dance." ...|$|R
