2500|$|In 2003 Mahathir {{spoke to}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Kuala Lumpur, {{and as part of}} his speech, said:If {{innocent}} people who died in the attack on Afghanistan and those who have been dying from lack of food and medical care in Iraq are considered collaterals, are the 3,000 who died in New York, and the 200 in Bali also just collaterals whose deaths are necessary for operations to succeed? Marie Huhtala, the American ambassador to Malaysia, responded with a statement: [...] "These are not helpful statements by any standard, and I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that Washington does take note of them.

But {{whenever}} the court {{let me go}} I was arrested again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come here to tell there is terrorism in Europe. I come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how to stop it. I have been an eye-witness.

His dismissal led to a widely circulated witticism in Ford circles as the hallmark phrase of Henry Ford I, [...] "History is bunk", was turned around to [...] "Bunkie is history".|$|E

For those that attend God's people, I would have thee {{look back to}} the place in this book where they are particularly touched upon. And for those that attend the hypocrite, in general they are these. 1. Blindness of heart in this world. 2. The death of their hope at the day of their death. 3. And the damnation of their souls at the day of judgment (Matt 23:15-19; Job 8:13, 11:20, 18:14, 20:4-7, Matt 23:33, 24:51; Luke 20:47).
