The main goal is to show not only that, when the largest share of the volume of foreign trade is constituted by intermediate goods and raw materials, a double accounting problem in trade flows is observed, but also that production specialization and trade of goods with a low value-added content impose an additional restriction to the “export-led growth strategies” 2 and that, through <b>factorial</b> <b>distribution</b> of income as a consequence of exports and median income, it can also be explained how exports growth did not contribute to the growth of the Mexican economy significantly.|$|E

30|$|The general {{deficit in}} terms of {{research}} on social competences has been known about {{for a long time}} while the requirements for these competences as a basis for vocational and specialist professionalism are growing. In this article we have shown how the definition and measurement difficulties of these competences can be handled, i.e., by using the reduced context of a specific occupation, and the concomitant set of social rules and values, an unambiguous definition becomes possible. The translation into Situational Judgment Tests can then be done by detecting work tasks, interactions and tools, etc. of the specific work environments by using a requirement analysis. This represents the basis for the competence model containing all necessary competence dimensions for achieving the occupational demands found in the previous investigation. In a final step Situational Judgment Tests based on an authentic environment can be devised, allowing an individual statement on the social competence dimension’s levels. First results in CoSMed show, that the distribution of competence levels is not satisfactory for all dimensions considering the stressful environment of medical assistants. It becomes visible that information and support in the area of social competences appear to be urgently needed during training for occupations with a great amount of social interactions. That is why future research should emphasize the development of models of learning for the underlying competence dimensions. This would support professional conduct when dealing with patients, clients, colleagues, etc. and facilitate a personally satisfactory and sustainable way of dealing with critical situations in a socially demanding occupation. Thus, a detailed analysis on the situational dependencies and <b>factorial</b> <b>distributions</b> has to be made to clearly define the model’s scope of application. Also, in regard to the newly emerging field of research, more comparable studies should be done for validation purposes. Finally, one could argue that the three dimensions can also be found in other occupations and they most probably would. However, their peculiarity and structure can only be holistically described in a clearly defined framework of for example a specific occupation. Yet, this does not exclude an inter-contextual influence, meaning that a medical assistant achieving a high level in one of the social-communication dimensions of their occupation could probably achieve a high level in the same social-communication dimension in another occupation more easily than a medical assistant with a low level. Assumptions like these should also be content of future research.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{opportunities}} and problems created for an oil economy by the price rise of 1973 with a special reference to Iran, and it is, {{as far as the}} author is aware, the first study to analyse the socio-economic performance of the Shah's regime in the subsequent period. We studied the Government's policies in the use of oil revenues, stressing the failure to pursue productive and social goals which would have been feasible. The data employed are based mainly on the Government budget, supplemented by figures on trade, national income, prices, employment, etc. The study includes two conceptual chapters, and the rest is empirical. The conceptual chapters argue that the opportunities provided by oil cannot last for ever; an oil economy should gradually diversify output and exports 'out of' this exhaustible resource, specialisation in which involves risks. We envisage diversification in a novel sense, as a dynamic concept interrelated with oil price and depletion policies, as a part of general development strategy. The economy may first go 'into' oil to raise revenues with the intention of diversifying 'out of' it in the long run. The revenues should be spent on accelerating the growth of non-oil GDP, paying due attention to basic needs. Development is the ultimate aim, diversification is the result; it is also the means through which development takes place. Developing the Kalecki approach to explain problems of acceleration of growth in an oil economy, we hypothesise that while the OPEC agreement raises the means toÂ· diversification, its achievement is limited by i) various 'physical bottlenecks', and ii) institutional factors. Iran's experience shows that Kalecki over-stressed the role of imports in accelerating growth and combating inflation. Even where foreign exchange is ample, an increase in the rate of growth could nevertheless be limited by the physical capacity for imports, the shortage of skilled labour, the lack of infrastructure, and the ceiling on the rate of growth of 'supply determined' commodities, particularly non-tradeable inputs and agricultural goods. Moreover, a mixture of demand-pull and cost-push inflation may arise as a result of imbalances in both the commodity and labour markets. At the same time, given a strong exchange rate made possible by oil, inflation would reduce the competitiveness of non-oil exports in foreign markets. Outlining a socio-economic frameworkfor Iran, we showed also that both the pace of development and the pattern of distribution of its benefits were adversely affected by Government policies. Oil made the role of the Government in the Iranian economy more decisive than in many socialist countries; but the objectives of the Government diverged from the aspirations of the masses. Its various policies exacerbated shortages and inflation, and they were also responsible for the slow growth of agriculture. In particular, a large diversion of public expenditures to 'nonproductive' uses, together with a rapid expansion of private consumption and investment in housing, limited the supply of physical resources to productive sectors. Further, Government policies biased the distribution of social services and private consumption heavily in favour of a minority 'governmental class'; and 'despotism' was intensified through militarism. The bias against Â·rural areas too was pronouncede The study indicates that the <b>factorial</b> <b>distribution</b> of income changed in favour of profit earners owing to the increase in the 'degree of monopoly', as hypothesised by Kalecki and Riach. The results of Government policies were fast depletion of oil, yet disappearance of the surplus in the balance of payments. Economic failure accompanied by social frustration led to the collapse of the regime, leaving the economy more than ever dependent on oil and imports of necessities. One conclusion is that the new regime would be well advised to aim at a strategy of slower economic growth associated with a slower rate of depletion; this allows more time to remove the structural bottlenecks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Depression {{and anxiety}} have been {{associated}} with a range of symptoms that often overlap. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale- 21 (DASS- 21) is a single instrument to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to adapt and validate the DASS- 21 for use in the Brazilian Portuguese language. Methods: the DASS- 21 has been adapted following the translation-back translation methodology from English to Portuguese. 242 subjects completed the following assessments: the DASS- 21, the Beck Depression Index (BM), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) and the Inventory of Stress Symptoms of Lipp (ISSL). Results: the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (WO) result was. 949, indicating that the adequacy of the model was high. Cronbach's alpha was. 92 for the depression,. 90 for the stress, and. 86 for the anxiety, indicating a good internal consistency for each subscale. the correlations between DASS scale and BDI scale, BAI scale and ISSL inventory were strong. the <b>factorial</b> analysis and <b>distribution</b> of factors among the subscales indicated that the structure of three distinct factors is adequate. Limitations: Older subjects over 65 years of age were not largely represented in this sample. A study specific to this elderly population should be conducted. Another limitation of the study was education level. the impact of low education in its applicability should be considered. Conclusions: the findings support the validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the DASS- 21 and add to the evidence of the DASS- 21 quality and ability to assess emotional states separately, eliminating the use of different instruments to assess these states.

Para os profissionais de saúde, que atendem a população idosa, há outro desafio: como medir qualidade de vida, não apenas para fazer um retrato da velhice, mas, principalmente, para avaliar o impacto de tratamentos, condutas e políticas, corrigir seus rumos, alocar recursos e planejar serviços, visando sobrevida melhor. Historicamente, após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, qualidade de vida se tornou um constructo importante, significando melhoria do padrão de vida. Paulatinamente o conceito foi ampliado, englobando o desenvolvimento sócio-econômico e humano e a percepção das pessoas a respeito de suas vidas. Não há consenso sobre seu significado, existindo várias correntes de pensamento, complementares entre si. Além disso, no decorrer do tempo, a forma de avaliação se alterou, passando de uma avaliação baseada em parâmetros objetivos, ou idealizados pelo pesquisador, para outra que valoriza a percepção subjetiva das pessoas. A partir de 1975, avaliações de qualidade de vida vêm sendo gradualmente incorporadas às práticas do Setor Saúde. O número de instrumentos é enorme, poucos especificamente construídos para idosos. No Brasil, os estudos expandiram-se em 1992 e, ultimamente, observamos trabalhos mais consistentes, como tradução, adaptação transcultural e validação de questionários estrangeiros; estudos a respeito de qualidade de vida do idoso são mais raros. Fica evidente a conveniência de se criar um instrumento que meça a qualidade de vida de idosos, valorizando a opinião deles a respeito das questões que consideram importantes. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram: delinear procedimentos necessários, para elaborar instrumento de avaliação da qualidade de vida de idosos e definir, a partir de investigação preliminar, os itens que constituirão lista a ser utilizada em etapa futura para elaboração efetiva do instrumento. Para isto, assumiu-se como referência uma metodologia consagrada na {{literatura}} médica, adaptada a nossos propósitos. Na primeira etapa elaborou-se lista preliminar de itens, testada através de investigação preliminar. Essa lista foi gerada a partir de três fontes: revisão das respostas a questionário anterior, revisão de outros instrumentos da literatura e nossa prática no atendimento. A investigação preliminar teve três fases, a primeira, espontânea, onde o entrevistado apontou itens por ele considerados relevantes para uma boa e má qualidade de vida, a segunda, estimulada, onde identificou a relevância dos demais itens da lista preliminar e, por fim, avaliou a importância (Likert) dos itens considerados relevantes. A análise dos procedimentos mostrou que a metodologia é viável. Entrevistou-se 19 idosos, nove homens e dez mulheres. As medianas encontradas foram: 82 minutos de duração da entrevista, variando de 56 a 118; 13 itens relatados espontaneamente, variando de 4 a 21; quatro itens não-entendidos, variando de 0 a 9; cinco itens excluídos, variando de 0 a 21. As recusas à participação foram de idosos dependentes; na verdade, recusa dos acompanhantes. Dois itens sugeridos na fase espontânea foram incorporados e se eliminou um item considerado redundante. Fez-se nova redação para onze itens não-compreendidos. Todos os itens excluídos serão mantidos para a próxima etapa. A escala de Likert necessitará de reformulação. Numa etapa posterior, a lista de itens, agora modificada, será reduzida através de duas técnicas, impacto clínico e análise fatorial. A distribuição dos itens resultantes em dimensões comporá o instrumento, cujo formato já está desenhado: Satisfação de Vida, Qualidade de Vida Idealizada e Qualidade de Vida Real. To live longer, {{what most}} people wish for nowadays {{can result in a}} life characterized by incapacity and dependency. The challenge {{is to be able to}} live longer, with a better quality of life. For health professionals who assist the elderly population, there is yet another challenge: how to measure quality of life, not only to have a clear picture of life among the elderly population, but mainly to assess the impact of treatment, procedures and policies, re-direct their goals, allocate resources and plan services, with the objective of achieving a better quality of life. Historically, after World War II, quality of life became an important concept, meaning the improvement in life standards. Gradually, the concept was extended, comprehending human and social-economic development and peoples perception of their own lives. There is no consensus on its meaning, and there are several currents which are complementary. Additionally, as time went by, the assessment technique changed, going from an objective parameter-based or researcher-based evaluation, to another type of evaluation which privileges peoples subjective perception. From 1975 on, quality of life assessments have been gradually incorporated into the Health Service practices. There are several instruments available for that, but few specifically built for the elderly population. In Brazil, the studies were broadened in 1992, and recently we have observed more consistent ones, which included translation, transcultural adaptation and validation of foreign questionnaires; studies on the elderly populations quality of life are rare. It is clear the necessity of creating an instrument to measure the quality of life of elderly people, taking into account their opinion regarding issues they consider important. The aims of this study were: to specify the necessary procedures in order to build an assessment instrument to evaluate elderly peoples quality of life and define from the preliminary evaluation, the items that will constitute a list to be used in a future step for the definite conception of the instrument. In order to do so, we have used a methodological reference from the medical literature, which was adapted to our objectives. During the first step we built a preliminary list of items, which was tested through a previous investigation. This list was generated by using three sources: review of answers to a previous questionnaire, review of other instruments from the literature and our own clinical practice. The preliminary investigation consisted of three phases: the first one, which was spontaneous, where the interviewee pointed out items he/she considered relevant for a good and bad quality of life; the second one, which was stimulated, where the interviewee identified the relevance of the all other items in the preliminary list; and finally, the third phase, where he/she assessed the importance of the items considered to be relevant (Likert). The analysis of the procedures showed that the methodology is viable. We interviewed 19 elderly patients, 9 men and 10 women. The medians were: 82 minutes of interview duration, varying from 56 to 118 minutes; 13 items reported spontaneously, varying from 4 to 21; four items which were nor understood, varying from 0 to 9; 5 excluded items, varying from 0 to 21. The refusals to participate came from dependent elderly patients, which were actually the escorts refusal. Two items that had been suggested during the spontaneous phase were incorporated and an item considered redundant was excluded. Eleven items that were not understood were rewritten. All items that were excluded will be kept for the next step. Likerts scale will have to be redesigned. During a posterior step the list of items, which has been modified, will be decreased through two techniques, clinical impact and <b>factorial</b> analysis. The <b>distribution</b> of resulting items into dimensions will constitute the instrument whose format has been designed: Life Satisfaction, Idealized Quality of Life and Actual Quality of Life...|$|R
