25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned <b>for</b> <b>LPG</b> fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E

5000|$|Alongside these coercive {{actions of}} expropriation, {{old and new}} farmers with smaller land {{holdings}} were increasingly encouraged to pool resources in a legally constituted cooperative form, the LPG, in which initially just land but later animals and machinery were shared and worked together. These were not [...] "state-owned" [...] farms (although {{a few of these}} did exist) - land, except as mentioned above, remained legally in private ownership and the LPG, although often dominated by communist party cadres, was a distinct legal entity operating independently as far as was feasible within the constraints of a planned economy. However, from the early 1960s, pressure mounted on remaining independent farmers to join the <b>LPGs</b> and <b>for</b> existing <b>LPGs</b> to merge in more fully collectivised forms. This process, and a drive to increased industrialisation, led in the 1970s to the separation of crop and animal production and the merging of each across villages to form much larger cooperative units in which, <b>for</b> example, one <b>LPG</b> <b>for</b> crop production with perhaps 3000 ha of land would supply feed to two LPGs working in animal production.|$|R

Internationally, ISO 5167-1:2003 and other ISO gas standard equivalents are in widespread use. Additional to natural gas, some flow computers offer an array of density calculations for steam, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and ethylene. Complex algorithms and Equations of State for wide ranges of hydrocarbon fluids and petrochemicals can also be found in liquid flow computers. API MPMS Chapter 11.1 (2004), NIST 1045 and IUPAC for ethylene measurement, GPA TP-27 <b>for</b> <b>LPGs</b> and NGLs are amongst an array of calculations performed by liquid flow computers. Other corrections specific to particular types or manufacturers of flow meters may also be implemented.
