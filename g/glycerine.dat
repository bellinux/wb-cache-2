5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (<b>glycerine</b> triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E
5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and <b>glycerine,</b> where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with <b>glycerine</b> to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of cannabis infusions {{owing to the}} variety of non-volatile solvents used. The plant material is mixed with the solvent and then pressed and filtered to express the oils of the plant into the solvent. Examples of solvents used in this process are cocoa butter, dairy butter, cooking oil, <b>glycerine,</b> and skin moisturizers. Depending on the solvent, these {{may be used in}} cannabis foods or applied topically.|$|E
25|$|Vegans {{will not}} use {{personal}} care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap, and collagen-derived <b>glycerine,</b> used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.|$|E
25|$|Lanolin from sheep's wool {{is found}} in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common {{ingredient}} in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with <b>glycerine,</b> it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{was quickly}} {{identified}} as chlorine, by an experimental laboratory established at General Headquarters on 27 April, by professors Watson, Haldane and Baker. In {{the first week}} of May, Watson and Major Cluny McPherson of the Newfoundland Medical Corps sent an anti-gas helmet to the War Office for approval. The helmet was a flannel bag, soaked in <b>glycerine,</b> hyposulphite and sodium bicarbonate and known as a Smoke Helmet and by 6 July, all British troops in France had received one. In November an improved P Helmet was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Hard {{toilet soap}} with a {{pleasant}} smell {{was produced in}} the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854–925), who also gave a recipe for producing <b>glycerine</b> from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria, {{to other parts of}} the Muslim world and to Europe.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and <b>glycerine</b> in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|E
25|$|His work is {{the basis}} of the falling sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is {{stationary}} in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by {{the time it takes to}} pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses <b>glycerine</b> as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 April 1915, German pioneers {{released}} chlorine gas which drifted into {{the positions of the}} French 87th Territorial and the 45th Algerian divisions, {{on the north side of}} the salient and caused many of the troops to run back from the cloud, leaving a gap in the Allied line. The German attack was a strategic diversion, rather than a breakthrough attempt and insufficient forces were available to follow up the success. As soon as German troops tried to advance into areas not affected by the gas, Allied small-arms and artillery fire dominated the area and halted the German advance. The surprise gained against the French, was increased by the lack of protection against gas and because the psychological effect of the unpredictable nature of the substance. A soldier could evade bullets and shells but gas seeped into trenches and dugouts and had a ghastly, slow choking effect. The gas was quickly identified as chlorine and the first Allied mass-produced anti-gas helmet was a flannel bag soaked in <b>glycerine,</b> hyposulphite and sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. <b>glycerine</b> or {{bisacodyl}} suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E

500|$|The {{bacillus}} causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, {{was identified}} and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch {{did not believe}} the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a <b>glycerine</b> extract of the tubercle bacilli as a [...] "remedy" [...] for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it [...] "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.|$|E
500|$|News stories {{continued}} {{to question the}} colt's ability, noting the relatively slow pace of the Derby and the low Beyer Speed Figure of 97 earned in his win. One trainer said, [...] "California Chrome has to prove again he's the best 3-year-old." [...] The horse was assigned the number three post position {{in a field of}} ten horses, and was the morning line odds-on favorite at 3–5. Followers noted that Secretariat had also run the 1973 Preakness Stakes from the number three post. The Thursday before the race, California Chrome was observed coughing after his morning gallop, prompting speculation about his health. He had a small blister in his throat, which he also had prior to the Kentucky Derby, both times treated with a <b>glycerine</b> throat wash. The intense press attention paid to the relatively minor issue was dismissively dubbed [...] "throat-gate" [...] by sportswriter Bill Dwyre of the Los Angeles Times.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Evita's death, Dr. Pedro Ara was {{approached}} to embalm the body. Fraser and Navarro write {{that it is}} doubtful that Evita ever expressed a wish to be embalmed, and suggest that it was most likely Juan Perón's decision. Ara was a professor of anatomy who had studied in Vienna and maintained an academic career in Madrid. His work was occasionally referred to as [...] "the art of death." [...] His highly advanced embalming technique consisted of replacing the corpse's blood with <b>glycerine,</b> which preserved all organs including the brain and created a lifelike appearance, giving the body the appearance of [...] "artistically rendered sleep." [...] Ara was known in Buenos Aires society for his work. Among the people he had embalmed was Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. Ara claims that his embalming of Evita's corpse began on the night of her death and that by the next morning, [...] "the body of Eva Perón was completely and infinitely incorruptible" [...] and suitable for display to the public.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Kajol {{established}} {{herself as}} a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring {{in three of the}} top-grossing productions of the year. Her first release that year was Sohail Khan's romantic comedy Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, in which she played Muskaan Thakur, a naive village girl who {{falls in love with a}} rich boy (played by Salman Khan), but faces difficulties in convincing her elder brother about her relationship. The film not just emerged as a box office hit, but also garnered positive comments from critics, as did Kajol's performance. In her next release, the psychological thriller Dushman, Kajol played the dual roles of twin sisters, Sonia and Naina Saigal, alongside Sanjay Dutt and Ashutosh Rana. Directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt, the film revolves around Naina avenging the rape and murder of her sister, and won Kajol critical appreciation with reviewer Sukanya Verma writing, [...] "Kajol is in superb form, both as the opinionated career-minded twin who is murdered, and as the avenger. Even she must have preferred less <b>glycerine</b> and more restraint." [...] Despite underperforming at the box office, Dushman proved to be a major critical success. For her performance, Kajol won her first Screen Award for Best Actress and received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.|$|E
2500|$|Sydney Arthur Monckton Copeman, an English Government {{bacteriologist}} {{interested in}} smallpox vaccine investigated {{the effects on}} the bacteria in it of various treatments, including <b>glycerine.</b> <b>Glycerine</b> was sometimes used simply as a diluent by some continental vaccine producers. However, Copeman found that vaccine suspended in 50% chemically-pure <b>glycerine</b> and stored under controlled conditions contained very few [...] "extraneous" [...] bacteria and produced satisfactory vaccinations. [...] He later reported that <b>glycerine</b> killed the causative organisms of erysipelas and tuberculosis when they {{were added to the}} vaccine in [...] "considerable quantity", and that his method was widely used on the continent. In 1896, Copeman was asked to supply [...] "extra good calf vaccine" [...] to vaccinate the future Edward VIII.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of the fully boiled hot process in soapmaking is the exact amount of hydroxide required need not be known with great accuracy. They originated when {{the purity of the}} alkali hydroxides were unreliable, as these processes can use even naturally found alkalis, such as wood ashes and potash deposits. In the fully boiled process, the mix is actually boiled (100+ °C), and, after saponification has occurred, the [...] "neat soap" [...] is precipitated from the solution by adding common salt, and the excess liquid is drained off. This excess liquid carries away with it much of the impurities and color compounds in the fat, to leave a purer, whiter soap, and with practically all the <b>glycerine</b> removed. The hot, soft soap is then pumped into a mold. The spent hydroxide solution is processed for recovery of <b>glycerine.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Albert Calmette, a French {{physician}} and bacteriologist, {{and his assistant}} and later colleague, Camille Guérin, a veterinarian, were working at the Institut Pasteur de Lille (Lille, France) in 1908.

They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and {{changed the course of}} their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on <b>glycerine</b> potato medium. [...] The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals. [...] They transferred to the Paris Pasteur Institute in 1919. [...] The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{a new style}} of wine known as ripasso (meaning [...] "repassed") emerged. With this technique, the pomace of {{leftover}} grape skins and seeds from the fermentation of recioto and Amarone {{are added to the}} batch of Valpolicella wines for a period of extended maceration. The additional food source for the remaining fermenting yeast helps boost the alcohol level and body of the wines while also leaching additional tannins, <b>glycerine</b> and some phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine's complexity, flavor and color. As the production of Amarone has increased in the 21st century, so too has the prevalence of ripasso style wines appearing in the wine market, with most Amarone producers also producing a ripasso as a type of [...] "second wine". An alternative method is to use partially dried grapes, instead of leftover pomace, which contain less bitter tannins and even more phenolic compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Fatty-acid {{methyl ester}} (FAME), more widely known as biodiesel, is {{obtained}} from vegetable oil or animal fats (biolipids) {{which have been}} transesterified with methanol. It can be produced from many types of oils, the most common being rapeseed oil (rapeseed methyl ester, RME) in Europe and soybean oil (soy methyl ester, SME) in the US. [...] Methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process, which results {{in the production of}} ethyl esters. The transesterification processes use catalysts, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, to convert vegetable oil and methanol into FAME and the undesirable byproducts <b>glycerine</b> and water, which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces. FAME can be used pure (B100) in engines where the manufacturer approves such use, but it is more often used as a mix with diesel, BXX where XX is the biodiesel content in percent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} notice {{from the}} Newcastle Morning Herald on 23 March 1886, states: [...] "A representative of this journal called at the Tighe's Hill Soap Works on Saturday last {{to see what}} progress was being made.

2500|$|The second factory, {{opened in}} 1900 at Sturt Street, {{previously}} owned by competitor Tidmarsh & Co, occupied 4 acres of floor space ( [...] 19,000 sq yards / 16,000m2 / 1.6 hectares [...] ) and employing over 200 men. Its most salient feature was the brick chimney – 152ft 4in (46.5m) in height and a flue diameter of 4ft (1.2m), and still standing (though no longer used). The boiler room housed four boilers, {{one of which}} was 27ft long and 7ft 6in in diameter (8.2m x 2.3m) and the largest to have been built in South Australia. The still-room had six large stills: four for distillation of stearine and two for <b>glycerine.</b> The building was organised so that manufacture started on the top floor and progressed by chutes or conveyors to the second floor for wrapping and packaging, thence to the ground floor, all with a minimum of handling. The smell emanating from the Sturt Street factory, despite installation of deep drainage, was the source of much complaint from neighbours.|$|E
2500|$|However {{often this}} tale has been reiterated, {{it is not}} beyond doubt. Dale himself {{said that it was}} handed down in University College, and showed some {{surprise}} that the constriction of the radial artery was measurable. Of Oliver’s descendants, none recalled experiments on his son. [...] Dale’s report of subcutaneous injections contradicts the concerned parties. Oliver: “During the winter of 1893–4, while prosecuting an inquiry as to … agents that vary the calibre of … arteries … I found that the administration by the mouth of a <b>glycerine</b> extract of the adrenals of the sheep and calf produced a marked constrictive action on the arteries.” Schäfer: “In the autumn of 1893 there called upon me in my laboratory in University College a gentleman who was personally unknown to me. … I found that my visitor was Dr. George Oliver, [...] was desirous of discussing with me the results which he had been obtaining from the exhibition by the mouth of extracts from certain animal tissues, and the effects which these had in his hands produced upon the blood vessels of man.” Systemic effects of orally given adrenaline are highly unlikely.

2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), <b>glycerine</b> (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E
2500|$|Vaccine {{produced}} by Copeman's method {{was the only}} type issued free to public vaccinators by the English Government Vaccine Establishment from 1899. At {{the same time the}} 1898 Vaccination Act banned arm-to-arm vaccination, thus preventing transmission of syphilis by this vaccine. However, private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers. Although proper use of <b>glycerine</b> reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material, scraped from the skin of infected calves, was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria. A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination. Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram, while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram. The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram, and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections. Unfortunately [...] glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates. However, it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory cold chain was available. Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign. A WHO survey of 59 producers, some of whom used more than one source of vaccine, found that 39 used calves, 12 [...] used sheep and 6 used water buffalo, whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens' eggs. English vaccine was occasionally made in sheep during World War I but from 1946 only sheep were used.|$|E
2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the <b>glycerine</b> also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E
