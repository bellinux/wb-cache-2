5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
2500|$|Mount Clara smelter is a heritage-listed former copper smelter at Rossmore Road, in {{the upper}} reaches of <b>Fat</b> <b>Hen</b> Creek, Oakview (near Kilkivan), Gympie Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1873. [...] It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main crop}} was barley. Samples found at Crosskirk and Bu {{also include the}} seeds of other plants such as <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> sorrel and chick weed. This mix was {{probably}} deliberate, since the other seeds have medical and nutritional value. [...] Cattle and some sheep were raised, and were supported through the winters.|$|E
60|$|Hardly had {{his eyes}} closed {{when he began to}} dream. You see, he had been {{thinking}} so hard about those <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> and he was so hungry for one of them, that right away he began to dream of <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b> It was a beautiful dream. At least, it was a beautiful dream to Reddy. <b>Fat</b> <b>hens</b> were all about him. They were so fat that they could hardly walk. Not only were they fat, but they seemed to think that their one object in life was to fill the stomachs of hungry foxes, for they just stood about waiting to be caught.|$|R
60|$|Never in all {{his life}} had Reddy Fox known {{anything}} so wonderful as was that dream. There were no dogs to worry him. There were no hunters with dreadful guns. All {{he had to do}} was to reach out and help himself to as many <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> as he wanted. He ate and ate and ate, all in his dream, you know, and when he could eat no more he started for home. When he started for home the <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> that were left started along with him. He led a procession of <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> straight over to his home in the Old Pasture.|$|R
60|$|Just before {{reaching}} the farm where the <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> and Bowser the Hound were, Blacky waited for Reddy Fox to catch up. It was some time before Reddy appeared, for he wasn't traveling as fast now as when he had started out. You see, that farm really was {{a very long way}} from the Old Pasture where Reddy lives and Reddy had run very hard, because, you know, he was so anxious to get one of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{beach and}} {{headlands}} are mostly California coastal prairie and Northern coastal scrub, while the riparian area of Calera Creek presents {{the most important}} upland habitat of the area. [...] Although the beach and headlands area are the least disturbed natural areas of the Rockaway Beach area, they are used moderately as recreation spots. [...] Vegetation is sparse on the beach with occurrences of Succulent sea fig, Hottentot fig, and <b>Fat</b> <b>hen</b> in the sandy areas. Farther away from the beach there are California poppies, Sand verbena, and Bush lupines. The near littoral elevation gradually increases toward the north until it reaches a headland peak of 175 feet.|$|E
2500|$|North of the {{developed}} area of Rockaway Beach is a hidden quarry, whose habitat is severely disturbed. [...] Rip-rap boulders protect {{the developed}} area from marine erosion. [...] Near Calera creek there is aquatic vegetation including rushes, bulrushes, horsetail, <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> and plantain. [...] The quarry area hosts {{a surprising number of}} amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and a variety of birds. [...] Avafauna sighted here include herons, egrets, California Least Terns, and red-winged blackbirds. [...] The headland cliffs within the quarry provide nesting sites for bank swallows, pelagic cormorants, and Brandt's cormorants. [...] Three endangered species are found proximate to Rockaway Beach: the San Francisco garter snake, the San Bruno elfin butterfly, and the California red-legged frog. These last two are found within the quarry property; the California red-legged frog is a critical food source for the San Francisco Garter Snake that is known to exist on the Mori Point National Park property immediately adjacent to the north.|$|E
6000|$|Quite certain in his {{own mind}} that there was no danger, Reddy lightly leaped up on the old stump and peeped into the hollow in the top. Then he blinked his eyes very fast indeed. If ever there has been a {{surprised}} Fox in all the Great World that one was Reddy. There was no <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> in that hollow! Reddy couldn't believe it. He wouldn't believe it. That <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> just had to be there. He blinked his eyes some more and looked again. All he saw in that hollow stump was a feather. The <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> had vanished. All Reddy's dreams of a good dinner vanished too. A great rage took their place. Somebody had stolen his <b>fat</b> <b>hen!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|So Reddy {{waited patiently}} and Blacky waited impatiently, and the <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> wandered about unsuspectingly, {{and for a}} long, long time nothing happened.|$|R
6000|$|To {{have seen}} and heard Blacky the Crow as he talked to Reddy Fox, {{you would have thought}} that there was nothing under the sun in his heart or mind but pity. [...] "Yes, Sir," [...] said he, [...] "I {{certainly}} would be tempted to show you where those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> are if you were not too weak. I just can't bear to see an old friend starve. It is too bad that those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> are so far away. I feel sure that one of them would make you quite yourself again." ...|$|R
60|$|And I {{accompanied}} her along the spidery {{bridge to the}} top of the 'midship- house, to look at the one rooster and the four dozen <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> in the ship's chicken-coop.|$|R
60|$|So Blacky followed, and {{his eyes}} twinkled when he saw Reddy hide the <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> in the hollow stump. He knew {{that no matter how}} far Bowser might chase Reddy, Reddy would come back for that <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> and he was rather glad to think that Reddy would have that good dinner after all.|$|E
60|$|Reddy {{looked about}} him hurriedly and anxiously. There wasn't {{a sign of}} anybody about, or that anybody had been there. Reddy's anger began to give place to wonder and then to {{something}} very like fear. How could anybody have taken that <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> and left no trace? And how could a <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> with a broken neck disappear of its own accord? It gave Reddy a creepy feeling.|$|E
60|$|As he ran, Reddy watched sharply {{this way}} and that way for a place to hide the <b>fat</b> <b>hen.</b> He knew he must find a place soon, because already that <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> was growing very heavy. Presently he spied the hollow stump of a tree. He didn't know it was hollow when he first saw it, but from its looks he thought it might be. The top of it was only about two feet above the ground. Reddy stopped and stood up on his hind legs so as to see if the top of that stump was hollow. It was. With a quick look {{this way and}} that way to make sure he wasn't seen, he tossed the <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> over into the hollow and then, with a sigh of relief, darted away.|$|E
6000|$|Blacky {{pretended not}} to hear this. [...] "I've often thought," [...] said he, [...] "of you and Mrs. Reddy as I have looked down at those <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b> It is too bad that they are so far away." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place his plan was working beautifully. You {{know what he was}} after was to get Reddy Fox over to that farm where Bowser was. He hoped that if Reddy should catch one of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> the farmer would put Bowser on Reddy's trail. He knew that Reddy would {{probably}} return straight home, and Bowser, following Reddy's trail, would thus find his way back home to Farmer Brown's. Of course, it all depended on whether Reddy would catch one of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> and whether Bowser would be allowed to hunt him. Blacky had a plan for making sure that if Reddy did get one of those hens the folks in the farmhouse would know it.|$|R
60|$|So, {{though he}} was so eager and so hungry, he made himself keep {{perfectly}} still, while he studied out a plan. By and by he stole ever so carefully around back of the barn to the cowyard. Some of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> were scratching in the straw of the cowyard. Just outside the cowyard was a pile of old boards. Reddy crawled behind this pile of old boards and then crouched and settled himself to be patient. He knew {{that sooner or later}} one of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> would be likely {{to come out of the}} cowyard. In this way he might be able to catch one without the others knowing a thing about it.|$|R
60|$|With {{the weight}} of that <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> off his shoulders, and the worry about it off his mind, Reddy could give all his {{attention}} to getting rid of Bowser the Hound. He {{had no intention of}} running any farther than he must. In the first place he had traveled so far that he did not feel like running. In the second place he wanted to get back to that hollow stump and the <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> just as soon as possible.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{was in a}} fix! He {{certainly}} was in a fix! Here {{he was with the}} <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> which he had come such a long, long way to get, and no chance to eat it, for Bowser the Hound was on his trail. Ordinarily Reddy Fox can run faster than can Bowser, but {{it is one thing to}} run with nothing to carry, and another thing altogether to with a burden as heavy as a <b>fat</b> <b>hen.</b> Reddy's wits were working quite as fast as his legs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't--don't {{talk about}} them," [...] said Reddy feebly. [...] "If I {{could have just}} one <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> that is all I would ask. Are they so very far from here?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Hughes, in a {{short story}} {{published}} in 1864, described a fictional game of Forfeits involving the song: A cry for forfeits arose. So the party sat down round Mabel on benches brought {{out from under the}} table, and Mabel began, --The first day of Christmas my true love sent to me a partridge and a pear-tree;The second day of Christmas my true love sent to me two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The third day of Christmas my true love sent to me three <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me four ducks quacking, three <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me five hares running, four ducks quacking, three <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree.And so on. Each day was taken up and repeated all round; and for every breakdown (except by little Maggie, who struggled with desperately earnest round eyes to follow the rest correctly, but with very comical results), the player who made the slip was duly noted down by Mabel for a forfeit.|$|R
60|$|As for Reddy, {{no sooner}} was Blacky {{well on his}} way than he started off at his swiftest pace. There was nothing weak or feeble in the way Reddy ran then. He was {{in a hurry to get}} to those <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{the next}} night, as Reddy Fox hunted and hunted for {{something}} to eat, he kept thinking of that dream of <b>fat</b> <b>hens,</b> and he kept wondering how he could get Blacky the Crow to tell him just where that farm with <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> was. Blacky on his part had spent a whole day wondering how he could induce Reddy Fox to make that long journey over to where Bowser the Hound was a prisoner of kindness. Blacky {{was smart enough to}} know that if he seemed too anxious for Reddy to make that long journey, Reddy would at once suspect something. He knew well enough that if Reddy had any idea that Bowser the Hound was over there, nothing would tempt him to make the trip.|$|R
60|$|Just {{imagine how}} Reddy felt {{when at last}} he awoke {{and there was not}} so much as a feather from a <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> {{anywhere}} about, while his stomach fairly ached with emptiness.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place his stomach had not been really filled for a long time. Food had been scarce, and while Reddy had always {{obtained}} enough to keep from starving, {{it was a long}} time since he had had a really good meal. He had, you remember, traveled a very long distance to catch that <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> and it had been many hours since he had had a bite of anything. There is nothing like a good appetite to make things taste good. Reddy certainly had the appetite to make that <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> the finest dinner a Fox ever ate.|$|E
60|$|But Granny {{was in no}} hurry. Not {{that she}} wasn't just as hungry for a <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> as was Reddy, {{but she was too}} wise and clever and {{altogether}} too sly to run any risks.|$|E
60|$|Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun, {{high in the}} blue, blue sky, {{looked down}} on as {{peaceful}} a scene as ever was. In the cowyard back of the barn of this particular farm stood several cows contentedly chewing their cuds as they took their daily airing. Half a dozen <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> were walking about among them and scratching in the straw. Out in the farmyard {{in front of the}} barn were many more <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b> Behind a pile of old boards just outside the cowyard was a spot of red. In the top of a tall tree not far distant was a spot of black. The smoke from the chimney of the farmhouse floated skyward in a lazy way. Looking down on the Great World, jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun saw no more peaceful scene anywhere.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the sound}} of Blacky's voice, Reddy was so startled that he jumped quite {{as if he had}} sat down on a prickly briar. He was sharp enough to know that it was no longer of any use to pretend. [...] "I'm feeling better," [...] said he. [...] "The thought of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> has quite {{restored}} my strength. Did you say that they are near here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm right {{sorry to}} hear this, Reddy," [...] said he. [...] "I {{certainly}} am. I've been hungry myself more than once. It seems a pity {{that you should be}} starving here when over on that farm I told you about yesterday are <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> to be had for the taking. If you were not so weak, I would be tempted to show you where they are." ...|$|R
60|$|But Reddy is {{something}} of a philosopher. That <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> was gone, and there was no use in wasting time puzzling over it. There were other fat hens where that one came from, and he would just have to catch another.|$|E
60|$|Reddy's {{first thought}} was that {{probably}} the farmer from whom he had stolen the <b>fat</b> <b>hen</b> had found it and taken it away. At once he began to use that wonderful nose of his searching for the scent of that farmer. Very carefully he sniffed all about the top of that old stump and inside the hollow. There wasn't the faintest scent of anybody there. Then he jumped down, and with his nose to the ground, ran all around the stump, sniffing, sniffing, sniffing. The only thing he discovered was the scent of Bowser the Hound, and he knew that Bowser had not taken that <b>fat</b> <b>hen,</b> because, as you remember, Bowser had kept right on chasing him.|$|E
60|$|On one of {{the lower}} roosts sat a <b>fat</b> <b>hen.</b> She was within easy jumping distance. Reddy knew that with one quick spring she would be his. If the henyard gate had been open, he would have {{wasted no time in}} making that one quick spring. But the henyard gate, as you know, was closed fast.|$|E
60|$|Reddy looked sharply {{for signs}} of a dog. Not one could he see. If there was a dog, he must be either in the barn or in the house. It was quite clear to Reddy that no Fox had bothered this flock of <b>fat</b> <b>hens.</b> He was sorely tempted to rush out and grab one of them at once, but he didn't. He was far too clever to do {{anything}} like that until he was absolutely sure that it would be safe.|$|R
60|$|Now on his {{way home}} Ready had to pass several farms. Hunger made him bold, and at each farm he stole softly as near as {{possible}} to the farmyard, hoping that he might find more <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> unguarded. Now it happened that that afternoon a farmer at one of these farms was preparing some chickens to be taken to market early the next morning. He was picking these chickens in a shed attached to the barn. He had several all picked when he was called to the house on an errand.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} at dusk of the {{afternoon}} of the day when Granny and Reddy Fox had talked over a plan to get one of those <b>fat</b> <b>hens</b> that Farmer Brown's boy collected the eggs and saw to it that the biddies had gone to roost for the night. He had just started to close the little sliding door across the hole through which the hens went in and out in the daytime when Bowser the Hound began to make a great racket, as if terribly excited about something.|$|R
