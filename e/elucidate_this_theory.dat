40|$|Architectural {{works and}} artistic {{productions}} are often {{characterized by a}} process of signification based on the personal interpretations of those who enjoy and use them. Such freedom of interpretation is understood in the present paper as a creative process that, in reworking facts and concepts, leads {{to the development of}} alternative solutions that are innovative and therefore creative. If applied by way of semiotic taxonomies to the management of digital resources, this process can enhance the contents by transforming them into multipliers of experience, able to provide new and unexpected suggestions capable of activating creative mental processes. The research and experimentation carried out by the faculty of architecture of the Università Iuav di Venezia, described in the present paper, help to explain and <b>elucidate</b> <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> which presents a new challenge for faceted taxonomies and controlled vocabularies...|$|E
40|$|Witnessing, {{as it is}} {{currently}} conceived in theatre and performance studies, is a mode of &# 147;active&# 148; and/or &# 147;ethical&# 148; spectatorship. However, such definitions neglect the insights of trauma studies scholars, who suggest that witnessing is neither active nor especially ethical. Instead, trauma studies theorists argue that witnessing is temporally belated, {{which is to say}} an after effect of spectatorship as well as a mode. Drawing on the language of trauma studies, and through an analysis of testimonial theatres made by, with, and about asylum seekers in Australia from 2000 to 2005, this thesis develops a theory of &# 147;performing witness. &# 148; Such a theory considers both the figure of the performing witness, defined as someone who testifies and retestifies in public whether on behalf of themselves or an absent other, and the function of performing witness, which is to say the process of producing, reproducing, representing, and responding to testimony. In order to <b>elucidate</b> <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> the thesis proceeds through a series of &# 147;scenes. &# 148; The first two chapters focus on theoretical &# 147;scenes,&# 148; one from theatre and performance studies (Bertolt Brecht&# 146;s &# 147;Street Scene&# 148;) and another from trauma studies (Shoshana Felman&# 146;s &# 147;Classroom Scene&# 148;), in order to ask: &# 147;How have these fields theorised witnessing and how might they illuminate one another?&# 148; The next four chapters pursue a single question across a series of sites: &# 147;What forms of witnessing do we find in performance?&# 148; These performance &# 147;scenes&# 148; include the interviews conducted by immigration officials (Chapter 3), a verbatim play based on interviews with refugees in which a refugee was cast as himself (Chapter 4), an autobiographical play devised and performed by that same refugee (Chapter 5), and a tribunal play based on the transcripts of a parliamentary inquiry into how a boat of asylum seekers came to grief off the coast of Australia (Chapter 6). Through these analyses, many theories of witnessing emerge: ambivalent; mimetic; antiphonic; and false witnessing. These new theories not only refine our understanding of theatrical witnessing, they also shift our understanding of witnessing more generally, inviting us to rethink the relationship between spectatorship, ethics, activity, and temporality...|$|E

40|$|Political {{theorists have}} long argued that low {{information}} levels among average citizens provide {{the rationale for}} public policy to be guided by experts and elites. Other scholars counter that deference to elites perpetuates and even exacerbates the problem. Here we look at school choice programs as an environment to <b>elucidate</b> <b>this</b> important debate. <b>Theories</b> of school choice suggest that parents need to and can make informed decisions. Choice parents should have more incentives to gather information about their child’s schools than parents without schooling options. Alternatively, a lack of any increase in information levels among school choosers would suggest that having choices per se is not sufficient motivation to overcome the costs of information gathering. Analyzing data from an experimental evaluation of the Washington Scholarship Fund, we find that presenting parents with choices does lead to {{significantly higher levels of}} accurate information on measures of important school characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Although $f(R) $ {{modification}} of late time cosmology is successful in explaining present cosmic acceleration, {{it is difficult}} to satisfy the fifth-force constraint simultaneously. Even when the fifth-force constraint is satisfied, the effective scalar degree of freedom may move to a point (close to its potential minima) in the field space where the Ricci scalar diverges. We <b>elucidate</b> <b>this</b> point further with a specific example of $f(R) $ gravity that incorporates several viable $f(R) $ gravity models in the literature.

30|$|Strictly speaking, all “learning and {{curriculum}} objects” {{created by the}} teacher resort under Teaching Presence and the Instructional design and management category (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison, & Archer, 2001). The usefulness of the resource sometimes classifies it differently. The most salient theme relating to video corresponded to Teaching Presence: direct instruction. It related to improving understanding and mastering theory, with 42 quotes (Table 3). Twenty-one students mentioned understanding the content better by watching the videos, but also developing {{a deeper understanding of}} the concepts. The videos explained the theories and elaborated them further, using new cases: “[videos] answered all the questions that may have arisen from a textbook”. The explaining theme confirms the quantitative findings (Table 2), that the most important reason to view a video again was for this purpose. These findings illustrate the fact that instructional lectures featuring large amounts of conceptual content can translate successfully to rich media formats such as videos, particularly entry-level content at the lower end of Bloom’s taxonomy (Sams & Bergmann, 2013), that progressed to deeper learning through repetition. Using practical real business-world examples helped to illustrate and <b>elucidate</b> the <b>theory.</b> <b>This</b> theme is testament to the lecturer’s knowledge of both subject and students, and anticipating where they would need supplemental material or examples. The lecturer did not interact online except sending announcements, but maintained an online Teaching Presence through prior creation of the resources.|$|R
