3000|$|Big 4 is also {{integrated}} as some studies, e.g., Richardson et al. (2013), {{have found}} an {{association with the}} level of corporate tax aggressiveness and the engaged audit firm. Following McGuire et al. (2012) the variables OverallExpert and TaxExpert are included as control variables for industry-specific knowledge on branch office level. The respective audit branch office is deemed to have overall (tax) expertise if it generates at least 30 % (see Neal and Riley 2004) of all of its annual fees (annual tax fees) by working for the observed firms from within the same town 10 and same industry, according to the two-digit GICS code. To control for the audit experience of the individual engagement partner, the variable Experience is also included in the regression model. Experience is measured {{on the basis of the}} natural logarithm of the number of years of professional experience that the auditor has gained since being appointed a certified public accountant to the date of signing the books, since audit quality may be influenced by the professional experience of the auditor (Cahan and Sun 2015; Ittonen et al. 2015). Concerning the variable TaxExpert, results will probably differ from those obtained by McGuire et al. (2012), because publicly disclosed tax fees paid to the local audit firm refer only to tax confirmation services (Taxfee). This means that every firm in the sample prepares its <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>statement</b> on its own or has another tax preparer than the incumbent audit firm. Therefore, it is unnecessary to model a first-stage model to control for the probability of purchasing auditor-provided tax services, as is done by McGuire et al. (2012). Nevertheless, TaxExpert and Taxfee are included in the regression model for completeness’ sake because the incumbent audit firm may not provide any tax planning services.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms and the {{development}} of Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues in the period of 1983 - 2011. It points out two key features of the Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms: 1) the tax reforms have embraced tax rates cutting and tax bases broadening apcomprehensive <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> system toward the schedular tax system. Then, regarding tax revenues, data shows that the Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues have increased considerably during that period; however they {{have not been able to}} increase Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> ratios significantly. This phenomenon indicates that even though the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms did have positive effects on increasing the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, they were not the only factors for the steep increase of Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. This paper shows that Indonesian's relatively high inflation rates and high economic growth during that period have considerably contributed to the steep increases of <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. At the end, in order to increase the Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues fur- ther, this paper notes that beside tax regulation reform, it is equally necessary to promote public tax awareness, tax authorities' professionalism and integrity, and the implementation of governance practices in Indonesian's bureaucracy...|$|R

In particular, {{we find that the}} optimal plan {{involves}} zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in investment sector and a nonzero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in consumption sector. In a two sector neoclassical economy, interdependence of labour and capital margins allows the government to choose an optimal policy that involves nonzero <b>tax</b> on capital <b>income.</b> The distortion created by capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in consumption sector can be undone by setting different rates of labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes.</b> The optimal plan thus involves zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in both sectors only if optimal labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> are equal. This may not be the optimal policy if marginal disutility of work is different across sectors and/or the social marginal value of capital is different across sectors. The difference in social marginal value of capital can be undone by setting different labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> across sectors.
