40|$|The {{advent of}} {{electric}} utility deregulation {{has created a}} market for green power; electricity generated {{in whole or in}} part from renewable resources. Green power satisfies both the environmental yearnings of its purchasers and the need of its sellers to differentiate their product offerings. While green power has captured a significant percentage of those residential and small commercial customers that have left their host utility, the percentage of all <b>eligible</b> <b>customers</b> in competitive <b>markets</b> that have chosen green power is still very small. This paper examines the development of competitive markets for green power in fou...|$|R

From 1 July 2007, when households became <b>eligible</b> <b>customers,</b> the electricity <b>market</b> opened fully. The electricity reforms carried out so far comprise of market liberalization, unbundling of activities, allowing regulated TPA, formation of an organized power market, adoption of incentive-based price cap regulation {{and the establishment of}} an independent regulatory body. The challenge that remains to be addressed is how to enhance competition in an electricity market that has a net importer position with limited cross-border capacity. Envisaged investments in generating and cross-border capacities will partially close the gap between domestic generation and consumption. Furthermore, since Slovenia has one of the largest levels of state ownership in the electricity sector among EU member states, privatization of electricity companies is envisaged in the near future.

40|$|Market makers on {{financial}} markets often act as competitiors and step into cooperations {{with each other}} at the same time. Primarily, they quote prices for investors, thus providing liquidity on the <b>customer</b> <b>market.</b> But they also trade with each other in order to reduce their inventory risk. The interdealer markets differs from walrasian markets in three main features: the trades are bilateral, the players usually form trading networks, the players have different bargaining powers. This paper describes the situation when <b>customer</b> and interdealers <b>markets</b> are strongly interconnected and characterizes the market equilibrium. Moreover, we investigate on different pricing strategies followed by market makers on the <b>customer</b> <b>markets,</b> when interdealer risk allocation is allowed. In this setup market makers operate in a duopoly on the <b>customer</b> <b>market,</b> and trading counterparties with different bargaining power on the interdealer markets. We show that the presence of an interdealer market reduces the market powers on the <b>customer</b> <b>markets.</b> We find also that the more risk averse market makers are, the lesser the market power on the <b>customer</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of prices in <b>customer</b> <b>markets</b> of the Phelps-Winter type under uncertainty. It is shown that the responsiveness of prices to short-run demand and cost changes depends crucially on whether the marginal customer is price risk averse or price risk loving. If he is price risk averse (loving), then the <b>customer</b> <b>market</b> price is less (more) flexible than the monopoly price. Competition makes the <b>customer</b> <b>market</b> price more rigid (flexible) if the marginal customer is price risk averse (loving). The scope of rigid <b>customer</b> <b>market</b> prices is wide if near-rational behavior of customers and the adjustment cost in the consumption process are taken into consideration.

40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>markets</b> are {{characterized}} by long-term relations between buyers and sellers. Long-term relations evolve if buyers trust sellers to provide high quality and if sellers are trustworthy. However, changes {{in the terms of}} this implicit contract may antagonize customers and disrupt the relation. We experimentally show that mutually beneficial long-term relations frequently prevail in markets for experience goods, and that price rigidity after a temporary cost shock is much more pronounced if price increases cannot be justified by cost increases. Hence, long-term relations on <b>customer</b> <b>markets</b> mitigate market failure of the “lemons” type, but are prone to price stickiness. <b>Customer</b> <b>market,</b> price stickiness, <b>customer</b> loyalty...|$|R

In this paper, I develop and solve a model of <b>customer</b> <b>markets</b> where equilibrium consists of important price and market share heterogeneity.
