5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

Players can attack enemies directly {{using a variety of}} weapons and offensive Psynergy spells, or by summoning Djinn, powerful other-worldly <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> enhance an attached character's hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinns can be set to standby, where players forfeit stat enhancements in order to unleash a powerful one-time attack where the player summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy.|$|E

It was broken up into 34 separate <b>entities</b> <b>that</b> included companies {{that would become}} ExxonMobil, Chevron and others.

Individual pieces of the company were worth more than the whole and, as shares of these doubled and tripled in value in their early years, Rockefeller became the country's first billionaire with a fortune worth nearly 2% of the national economy. His peak net worth was estimated at $336 billion (in 2007 USD, inflation-adjusted) in 1913. Rockefeller spent the last 40 years of his life in retirement at his estate in Westchester County, New York. His fortune was mainly used to create the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy through the creation of foundations that had a major effect on medicine, education and scientific research. His foundations pioneered the development of medical research and were instrumental in the near-eradication of hookworm and yellow fever. in the United States.|$|E
