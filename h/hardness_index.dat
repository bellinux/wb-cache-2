Although ceramic technicians have long understood many of these relationships, the advent of computer software to automate the conversion from batch to formula and analysis has brought this science within the reach of many more people. Physical properties of glazes in fired products (like thermal expansion, <b>hardness,</b> <b>index</b> of refraction, color and melting temperature or range) are directly (but not solely) related to the chemistry. Properties of glass melts like viscosity and surface tension are also principally products of chemistry.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of moistening and gentle drying of wheat grain on {{the variability of}} such significant features as its hardness and kernel thickness have been studied. For moistening, the wheat grain samples were placed between layers of blotting paper imbibed by distillate water. This process lasted for 6 h. Then, after removing excess water from the kernels, the samples were dried at room temperature. Measurements of hardness (<b>hardness</b> <b>index)</b> and thickness (diameter) of a single kernel were carried out using a single-kernel characterization system type SKCS 4100 on the dried grain and on the control material (non-moistened grain). The results obtained clearly showed that after moistening a considerable decrease in the grain <b>hardness</b> <b>index,</b> by 10. 6 [-] on the average, and rise in the kernel diameter, by 0. 05 mm on the average, took place. The range of these changes was first of all related to the wheat cultivar. Rise in kernel thickness without a simultaneous increase in its weight shows that {{as a consequence of}} moistening, there could occur inner cracks of the endosperm causing an increase of its total volume and porosity. This kind of damage weakens the hardness of grain endosperm as well which what is reflected in the decrease of <b>hardness</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the intra-specific variation of wheat grain quality response to elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration (e[CO 2]), eight wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were grown at two CO 2 concentrations ([CO 2]) (current atmospheric, 389 CO 2 μmolmol- 1 vs. e[CO 2], FACE (Free-Air CO 2 Enrichment), 550 ± 10 % CO 2 μmolmol- 1), at two water levels (rain-fed vs. irrigated) and at two times of sowing (TOS 1, vs. TOS 2). The TOS treatment was mainly imposed to understand whether e[CO 2] could modify the effects of timing of higher grain filling temperatures on grain quality. When plants were grown at TOS 1, TKW (thousand kernel weight), grain test weight, <b>hardness</b> <b>index,</b> P, Ca, Na and phytate were not significantly changed under e[CO 2].

40|$|Wheat grain {{quality has}} a complex genetic {{architecture}} {{heavily influenced by}} the growing environment. Consistency in wheat quality not only affects the efficiency of milling and baking but also the quality of end-use products. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) analyze the different wheat quality parameters in Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) grown under different environments, and 2) to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with quality stability in RILs grown under different environments. A set of 180 RILs derived from two spring wheat lines 'Halberd' and 'Len' were grown at Uvalde and College Station TX, in the 2009 / 2010 growing season and at Chillicothe and College Station TX, in 2010 / 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications within each location. Each line was tested for multiple quality traits that included grain hardness, protein content, dough mixing properties and bread baking quality using Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS), Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectrometry (NIRS) analysis, mixograph and the Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Sedimentation (SDSS) test. Genetic linkage map construction was carried out with 116 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the RILs. Then composite interval mapping was carried out to identify QTLs associated with quality traits. The SDSS column height was positively correlated across four environments. Similarly, it was found to have significant positive correlation with mixing tolerance and peak time within and also across locations. However, the SDSS was negatively correlated with the <b>hardness</b> <b>index.</b> The protein percent was not significant with any of the quality traits within and across environments.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between biceps brachii hardness using the transient elastography technique, and its activity level by quantifying the surface electromyographic signal (sEMG). Ten healthy subjects volunteered for this protocol. To assess the maximal biceps brachii myoelectric activity (sEMG-RMSm), subjects had to achieve their maximal voluntary contraction trial during an elbow flexion effort. They were then asked to perform an isometric biceps sEMG-RMS ramp trial in elbow flexion from 0 % to 50 % of their sEMG-RMSm in 120 s. A low-frequency pulse was sent every 5 s during all trials by an innovative shear elasticity probe previously placed over the belly of the biceps brachii allowing the calculation of a transverse shear modulus. The main results of this study were (i) the finding of a systematic linear relationship between the biceps brachii transverse shear moduli and the corresponding sEMG-RMS values. This was not the case when plotting transverse shear modulus versus the elbow flexion torque production. Therefore, the computation of a <b>hardness</b> <b>index</b> from the slope of individual transverse shear modulus-sEMG-RMS linear relationship was enabled; (ii) It was also found that the higher is the rest shear modulus, the lower is the <b>hardness</b> <b>index,</b> indicating that the transverse shear modulus change during contraction depends on its level at rest. Therefore, this non-invasive technique could be useful in the medical field to explore deep muscles which are unreachable by classical testing methods.

We observe a strong degeneracy between forbidden-line sequences produced by changes in stellar Teff and metal abundance, which severely complicates the application of many forbidden-line diagnostics to extragalactic H II regions. Our data confirm however that the Edmunds and Pagel [O II]+[O III] abundance index and the Vilchez and Pagel `eta' index provide more robust diagnostics of metal abundance and stellar effective temperature, respectively. A comparison of the fractional helium ionization of the H II regions with stellar temperature confirms the reliability of the spectral type vs Teff calibration for the relevant temperature range Teff < 38000 K.

Central Chile is characterised by high-yield Mediterranean conditions, where precipitation received by the crop in most years does not represent a major limitation to productivity. This study assesses the changes in agronomic and physiological traits of spring cultivars released in the country between 1920 and 2000. A total of 95 spring bread wheat accessions, representing 20 old and 75 modern cultivars (released before and after 1960, respectively) were tested in a humid Mediterranean-type climate, with irrigation. Modern genotypes exhibited higher grain yield, harvest index, number of grains per ear and sedimentation values and lower height, test weight, wet gluten content and <b>hardness</b> <b>index.</b> No differences were found for days to heading, and ear length, whereas kernel weight decreased with the Green Revolution. Principal component (PC) analysis using ten agronomic traits clearly separated modern from old cultivars. Grain yield, a trait not included in PC analysis, was highly correlated with the first PC (r= 0. 80, P < 0. 0001), where modern cultivars presented lower plant height, higher harvest index and better grain quality, as indicated by the higher sedimentation values and lower <b>hardness</b> <b>index</b> values. The year of release of cultivars was related negatively to plant height and positively to harvest index, number of grains per ear and sedimentation value. In a further study, changes in photosynthetic and transpirative traits were investigated in a subset of 14 genotypes covering the same 80 -year range. Differences in grain yield across genotypes were related positively to stomatal conductance and transpiration rates of the flag leaves during grain filling and negatively to oxygen isotope composition and (to a lesser extent) carbon isotope composition in kernels. The results suggest that the higher grain yield of modern varieties is related to higher stomatal conductance and transpiration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The scanning electron microscopy and EDX examinations at the interfaces of the laminated ceramic samples showed that the compound is very compact and stable. Within the scope of this thesis it has been shown the possibility of production of hierarchically structured stable ceramic components. Layered ceramics are very promising in the search for a way to tailor “intelligent composites” to satisfy the complex requirements of dentistry. ...|$|R

The presented results allow to compare approximately the indications of individual devices of different types. The description of the author’s own microprocessor tester for the quality assessment of the sand foundry moulds, is shown. On the bases of the measurements results it is possible, to evaluate indirectly, the mould apparent density in the selected points, {{as well as several}} other properties...|$|R
