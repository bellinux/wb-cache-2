40|$|A {{multi-stage}} {{continuous culture}} apparatus has been constructed to model mono-species biofilms and high species diversity biofilm consortia found in clinical practice, {{the natural environment}} and the built environment. New artificial saliva and urine media were developed, and natural and treated potable waters obtained, for the defined, reproducible generation of the biofilms containing bacterial and protozoal pathogens on various hydroxyapatite, plastic, metal and paint-covered substrata over many months. Following several modifications to the design, each chemostat vessel, linked in series or parallel, consists of a titanium top plate containing a variety of insertion ports for the monitoring electrodes, and addition/removal of gases, media, effluent, pH and redox titrants, antibacterial agents and coupon substrata for biofilm generation. Each top plate is clamped to a 1 liter glass vessel, containing the culture medium, and mounted on a stirrer with a <b>heater</b> <b>pad</b> to facilitate external heating and stirring, controlling the shear rate across the immersed coupons. There are few internal parts to go wrong. The growth rate is controlled by continuous addition of medium to the planktonic and sessile phases of the cultures. These model systems are ideal for generating biofilms either aerobically or anaerobically, and containing microaerophilic or anaerobic species, even in highly aerated media...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} experimentally and theoretically {{the power}} consumption of a notch filter using a thermooptic long-period grating, which is induced by a heater array consisting of periodic heaters and pads made of metal thin-film. Since {{the power consumed}} by the heater array is converted to joule heat that generates the thermooptic long-period grating, {{the characteristics of the}} notch filter are dynamically controlled by adjusting it. The power necessary for appropriate coupling efficiency depends on the parameters of the heater array, which are the width and length of a <b>heater,</b> <b>pad</b> width, and the thickness of the thin-film. To analyze the dependence, we fabricated several notch filters with different heater lengths and pad widths. In addition, we simulated the influence of the parameters on the power consumption using some approximation and assumptions. Through the experiment and the simulation, it is shown that the experimentally obtained changes of the consumed power depending on the parameters follow a trend achieved theoretically. Moreover, the experimental results show that the consumed power decreases by more than 50 % as the heater length is reduced from 500 to 50 μm. Finally, we suggest a few guidelines on the parameters required to reduce the power consumption. close 0...|$|E
40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} assessment of volatile and semivolatile organic compounds {{in the environment}} using gas chromatography �GC � is often limited by cost of analysis, and time delays between sampling and analysis. Many environmental monitors incorporating GC systems are too large for portability, and lack sufficient sensitivity and/or selectivity to serve as practical environmental monitors. Frequently, a complete system redesign, due to nonlinear power scaling relative to component size, is required to reduce the mass and volume of power supplies, especially for the micro-systems of present interest. Here, we examined four strategies in reducing power demand by the largest consumer of power in a model micro GC, the preconcentrator. Our simulations included alterations in <b>heater</b> <b>pad</b> placement/size, reduction of thermal mass in the device, vacuum sealing, and incorporation of a gas dwell time during preconcentrator heating. Our numerical results were in general agreement with experimental findings in simpler systems, {{in terms of the}} benefits of vacuum sealing. The greatest reductions in power demand were achieved with vacuum sealing � 51 % � and reductions in thermal mass � 15 %�. Future work will address structural and materials issues involved in reduction of thermal mass, and also optimization of power supplies required to meet the multilevel power demands of these complex microelectromechanical systems. © 2005 American Vacuum Society. �DOI: 10. 1116 / 1. 1886821 � I...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThermal {{enhancement}} through {{application of}} nanofluid coolant {{in a single}} cooling plate of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell was experimentally investigated in this paper. The study focuses on low concentration of Al 2 O 3 dispersed in Water - Ethylene Glycol mixtures as coolant in a carbon graphite PEM fuel cell cooling plate. The {{study was conducted in}} a cooling plate size of 220 mm x 300 mm with 22 parallel mini channels and large fluid distributors. The mini channel dimensions are 100 mm x 1 mm x 5 mm. A constant heat load of 100 W was applied by a <b>heater</b> <b>pad</b> that represents the artificial heat load of a single cell. Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle used was 0. 1 and 0. 5 vol % concentration which was then dispersed in 50 : 50 (water: Ethylene Glycol) mixture. The effect of different flow rates to heat transfer enhancement and fluid flow represented in Re number range of 20 to 120 was observed. Heat transfer was improved up to 13. 87 % for 0. 5 vol % Al 2 O 3 as compared to the base fluid. However the pressure drop also increase which result in pumping power increment up to 0. 02 W. The positive thermal results implied that Al 2 O 3 nanofluid is a potential candidate for future applications in PEM fuel cell thermal management...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{array of}} microscale heaters {{is being developed}} to measure the heat transfer coefficient at many points underneath individual bubbles during boiling {{as a function of}} space and time. This heater array enables the local heat transfer from a surface during the bubble growth and departure process to be measured with very high temporal and spatial resolution, and should allow better understanding of the boiling heat transfer mechanisms by pin-pointing when and where in the bubble departure cycle large amounts of wall heat transfer occur. Such information can provide much needed data regarding the important heat transfer mechanisms during the bubble departure cycle, and can serve as benchmarks to validate many of the analytical and numerical models used to simulate boiling. The improvements to the heater array include using a silicon-on-quartz substrate to reduce thermal cross-talk between the heaters, decreased space between the <b>heaters,</b> increased <b>pad</b> sizes on the heaters, and progressive heater sizes. Some results using the present heater array are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To compare four field-appropriate torso warming modalities, that do {{not require}} AC {{electrical}} power, using a human model of non-shivering hypothermia. Methods: Five subjects, serving as their own controls, were cooled four times in 8 ºC water, for 10 - 30 minutes. Shivering was inhibited by Buspirone (30 mg) taken orally prior to cooling and IV Meperidine (1. 25 mg/kg) at the end of immersion. Subjects were hoisted out of the water, dried, insulated and then underwent 120 min of either: spontaneous warming only; a charcoal heater on the chest; two flexible hot water bags (total 4 liters of water at 55 °C, replenished every 20 minutes) applied to the chest and upper back; or two chemical heat pads applied to the chest and upper back. Supplemental meperidine (maximum cumulative dose of 3. 5 mg/kg) was administered as required to inhibit shivering. Results:  Post-cooling afterdrop was compared to spontaneous warming (2. 2 °C) less for chemical heat pads (1. 5 °C) and hot water bags (1. 6 °C, p < 0. 05), and was 1. 8 °C with the charcoal heater.   Subsequent core rewarming rates, the hot water bags (0. 7 °C/h) and the charcoal heater (0. 6 °C/h), tended to be higher than chemical heat pads (0. 2 °C/h, p = 0. 055) and was significantly greater than spontaneous warming (0. 1 °C/h, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: In subjects with shivering suppressed, greater sources of external heat were effective in attenuating core temperature afterdrop whereas sustained sources of external heat effectively established core rewarming. Depending on scenario and available resources, we advice to use charcoal <b>heaters,</b> chemical heat <b>pads</b> or hot water bags as effective means for treating cold patients in the field or during transport to definitive care...|$|R
40|$|To provide uniform cooling for a {{fuel cell}} stack, a cooling plate concept was evaluated. This concept {{utilized}} thin cooling plates to extract heat from the interior of {{a fuel cell}} stack and move this heat to a cooling manifold where it can be transferred to an external cooling fluid. The advantages of this cooling approach include a reduced number of ancillary components and the ability to directly utilize an external cooling fluid loop for cooling the fuel cell stack. A number of different types of cooling plates and manifolds were developed. The cooling plates consisted of two main types; a plate based on thermopyrolytic graphite (TPG) and a planar (or flat plate) heat pipe. The plates, along with solid metal control samples, were tested for both thermal and electrical conductivity. To transfer heat from the cooling plates to the cooling fluid, a number of manifold designs utilizing various materials were devised, constructed, and tested. A key aspect of the manifold was {{that it had to be}} electrically nonconductive so it would not short out the fuel cell stack during operation. Different manifold and cooling plate configurations were tested in a vacuum chamber to minimize convective heat losses. Cooling plates were placed in the grooves within the manifolds and heated with surface-mounted electric <b>pad</b> <b>heaters.</b> The plate temperature and its thermal distribution were recorded for all tested combinations of manifold cooling flow rates and heater power loads. This testing simulated the performance of the cooling plates and manifold within an operational fuel cell stack. Different types of control valves and control schemes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to maintain a constant temperature of the cooling plates. The control valves regulated the cooling fluid flow through the manifold, thereby controlling the heat flow to the cooling fluid. Through this work, a cooling plate and manifold system was developed that could maintain the cooling plates within a minimal temperature band with negligible thermal gradients over power profiles that would be experienced within an operating fuel cell stack...|$|R
