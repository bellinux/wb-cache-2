This {{article examines the}} process of adjustment to the commodity boom in four industrialized, commodity-exporting countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway). The article focuses on both the direct adjustment within the commodity-producing sectors (via increased employment and capital spending) and the <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the macro economy. The analysis finds that the <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustment</b> process, which was triggered by the increase in incomes that the commodity-price boom generated, {{has been the most}} important part of the adjustment in all four economies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the late}} 1980 s and early 1990 s a {{generalized}} HIV epidemic affected Thailand which was relatively well controlled by an intensive national campaign {{by the mid}} 1990 s. The {{extent to which the}} epidemic has slowed or possibly reversed the epidemiological transition in Thailand is relatively unknown. METHODS: Under-five mortality rates (U 5 MR) were determined from various sources and weighted least squares regression conducted to determine U 5 MR over the years 1980 - 2000. Direct and indirect estimates of the completeness of death registration were used to estimate mortality levels in those aged more than 5 years for the 1980 - 90 and 1990 - 2000 periods. Life tables were constructed using the various estimates to determine changes in life-expectancy between the two time periods. RESULTS: U 5 MR in Thailand is estimated to have been 58 / 1000 live births in 1980, declining to 30 in 1990 and to 23 in 2000. The vital registration system clearly underestimates U 5 MR. Successive surveys of Population Change (SPC) imply coverage of death registration improving from 75 - 77 % in 1985 - 86 to 95 % in 1995 - 96, partly due to a reliance on self-reported registration in the latter survey. In contrast, the General Growth Balance-Synthetic Extinction Generations (GGB-SEG) method suggests coverage worsening from 78 - 85 % in 1980 - 90 to 64 - 72 % in 1990 - 2000. Life tables based on SPC adjustments show continued declines in female, and to a lesser extent, male adult mortality with corresponding increases in life-expectancy at birth of around 6 years for both sexes from 1980 - 90 to 1990 - 2000. In contrast, the <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustments</b> suggest a substantial increase in male adult mortality with female adult mortality unchanged; life expectancy decreased by 4 years for males and was only marginally higher in females. CONCLUSION: Given the conflicting evidence a definitive assessment of mortality change in Thailand between 1980 and 2000 is difficult to make. <b>Indirect</b> <b>adjustments,</b> based on demographic methods point to a major reversal in mortality decline among males, and a slowing in females. If adult mortality registration has declined, and given the continued under-registration of infant and child deaths, remedial measures are urgently required if the mortality system is to better inform and monitor health development in Thailand...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{identifying}} {{the direction of}} the short-term trend (nonstationary mean) of seasonally adjusted series contaminated by high levels of variability has become of relevant interest in recent years. In fact, major financial and economic changes of global character have introduced a large amount of noise in time series data, particularly, in socioeconomic indicators used for real time economic analysis. The aim {{of this study is to}} construct a cascade linear filter via the convolution of several noise suppression, trend estimation, and extrapolation linear filters. The cascading approach approximates the steps followed by the nonlinear Dagum (1996) trend-cycle estimator, a modified version of the 13 -term Henderson filter. The former consists of first extending the seasonally adjusted series with ARIMA extrapolations, and then applying a very strict replacement of extreme values. The nonlinear Dagum filter has been shown to improve significantly the size of revisions and number of false turning points with respect to H 13. We construct a linear approximation of the nonlinear filter because it offers several advantages. For one, its application is direct and hence does not require some knowledge on ARIMA model identification. Furthermore, linear filtering preserves the crucial additive constraint by which the trend of an aggregated variable should be equal to the algebraic addition of its component trends, thus avoiding the selection problem of direct versus <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Finally, the properties of a linear filter concerning signal passing and noise suppression can always be compared to those of other linear filters by means of spectral analysis.

It is further shown how the SEATS output can be of help in model selection. Finally, the important problem of the choice between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustment</b> of an aggregate is addressed. It is concluded that, because aggregation has a strong effect on the spectral shape of the series, and because seasonal adjustment is a non linear transformation of the original series, direct adjustment is preferable, even at the cost of destroying identities between the original series. applied time series analysis, regression-arima models, seasonal adjustment, trend-cycle estimation, direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustment...</b>|$|E

40|$|Government {{statistical}} {{agencies are}} required to seasonally adjust non-stationary time series resulting from aggregation {{of a number of}} cross-sectional time series. Traditionally, this has been achieved using the X- 11 or X 12 -ARIMA process by using either direct or <b>indirect</b> seasonal <b>adjustment.</b> However, neither of these methods utilizes the multivariate system of time series which underlies the aggregated series. This paper compares a model-based univariate approach to seasonal adjustment with a model-based multivariate approach. Firstly, the univariate basic structural model (BSM) is applied directly to the aggregated series to obtain estimates of the seasonal components. Secondly, the multivariate basic structural model is applied to a transformed system of cross-sectional series to also obtain estimates of the seasonal components of the aggregated series. The prediction mean squared errors resulting from each method are compared by calculating their relative efficiency.

40|$|Dynamic Linear Models are a {{state space}} model {{framework}} {{based on the}} Kalman filter. We use this framework to do seasonal adjustments of empirical and artificial data. A simple model and an extended model based on Gibbs sampling are used {{and the results are}} compared with the results of a standard seasonal adjustment method. The state space approach is then extended to discuss direct and <b>indirect</b> seasonal <b>adjustments.</b> This is achieved by applying a seasonal level model with no trend and some specific input variances that render different signal-to-noise ratios. This is illustrated for a system consisting of two artificial time series. Relative efficiencies between direct, indirect and multivariate, i. e. optimal, variances are then analyzed. In practice, standard seasonal adjustment packages do not support optimal/multivariate seasonal adjustments, so a univariate approach to simultaneous estimation is presented by specifying a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method. This is applied to two sets of time series systems by defining a total loss function that is specified with a trade-off weight between the individual series’ loss functions and their aggregate loss function. The loss function is based on either the more conventional squared errors loss or on a robust Huber loss. The exponential decay parameters are then estimated by minimizing the total loss function for different trade-off weights. It is then concluded what approach, direct or <b>indirect</b> seasonal <b>adjustment,</b> is to be preferred for the two time series systems. The dynamic linear modeling approach is also applied to Swedish political opinion polls to assert the true underlying political opinion when there are several polls, with potential design effects and bias, observed at non-equidistant time points. A Wiener process model is used to model the change in the proportion of voters supporting either a specific party or a party block. Similar to stock market models, all available (political) information is assumed to be capitalized in the poll results and is incorporated in the model by assimilating opinion poll results with the model through Bayesian updating of the posterior distribution. Based on the results, we are able to assess the true underlying voter proportion and additionally predict the elections.

40|$|Most of the Euro-zone {{economic}} short-term {{indicators are}} computed through aggregation from Member States data. The seasonally adjusted figures {{can be calculated}} by seasonally adjusting the aggregate (direct approach) or aggregating the seasonally adjusted national data (indirect approach). Statistical and practical considerations to choose the right strategy are given in the paper. An application to the Euro-zone GDP is presented. The same aggregation problem encountered {{in the case of}} seasonal adjustment will persist when extracting the business cycle. Moreover, since raw figures imply problems in terms of excessive noise of the series, analysts generally prefer the use of seasonally adjusted time series. As a consequence, the problem of choosing between direct and indirect both in seasonal adjustment and in business cycle extraction appears to be closely linked. In fact, the approach chosen to seasonally adjust the data can in theory lead to different results when the cyclical component has to be extracted from sea-sonally adjusted data.

The accuracy of this multivariate approach is compared to the accuracy of the seasonal component using a univariate (or direct) approach. By decomposing the error structure into common and specific effects, the model is a blend of traditional structural time series models and dynamic error components models. The link between the series is modeled by the covariance of the disturbances driving the series which is the variance parameter of the common effect. Estimation of the components is carried out by firstly writing the model in state space form and then applying the Kalman filter and smoother.

We chose to study 3 major cities in SWO in this paper. We compared age-standardized hospital admission ratios of Sarnia and Windsor to London, and to generate hypotheses about potential pollutant-induced health effects in the 'Chemical Valley', Sarnia. Methods The number of daily hospital admissions was obtained from all hospitals in London, Windsor and Sarnia from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2000. We used <b>indirect</b> age <b>adjustment</b> method to obtain standardized admissions ratios {{for males and females}} and we chose London as the reference population.

Results Our findings showed that Sarnia and Windsor had significantly higher age-adjusted hospital admissions rates compared to London.

40|$|Shock-induced damage beneath impact craters is {{studied in}} this work. Two {{representative}} terrestrial rocks, San Marcos granite and Bedford limestone, are chosen as test target. Impacts {{into the rock}} targets with different combinations of projectile material, size, impact angle, and impact velocity are carried out at cm scale in the laboratory. Shock-induced damage and fracturing would cause large-scale compressional wave velocity reduction in the recovered target beneath the impact crater. The shock-induced damage is measured by mapping the compressional wave velocity reduction in the recovered target. A cm scale nondestructive tomography technique is developed for this purpose. This technique is proved {{to be effective in}} mapping the damage in San Marcos granite, and the inverted velocity profile is in very good agreement with the result from dicing method and cut open directly. Both compressional velocity and attenuation are measured in three orthogonal directions on cubes prepared from one granite target impacted by a lead bullet at 1200 m/s. Anisotropy is observed from both results, but the attenuation seems to be a more useful parameter than acoustic velocity in studying orientation of cracks. Our experiments indicate that the shock-induced damage is a function of impact conditions including projectile type and size, impact velocity, and target properties. Combined with other crater phenomena such as crater diameter, depth, ejecta, etc., shock-induced damage would be used as an important yet not well recognized constraint for impact history. The shock-induced damage is also calculated numerically to be compared with the experiments for a few representative shots. The Johnson-Holmquist strength and failure model, initially developed for ceramics, is applied to geological materials. Strength is a complicated function of pressure, strain, strain rate, and damage.

Greater energy expenditure from any and all physical activity was significantly associated with reduced risk of developing mobility limitation among men, but not among women...|$|R
40|$|Background: Maternal {{smoking and}} low {{socioeconomic}} status {{are known to}} be associated {{with each other and with}} longstanding respiratory problems in childhood but their interrelation has received little attention. In this paper, the interrelations is studied using a conceptual hierarchical framework among children aged 0 - 11 years in a representative sample of British households with children. Method: With data from the family and children study, this paper tested a conceptual hierarchical framework, in which maternal education acting through lone parenthood would influence material hardship and all three would have effects on maternal smoking increasing the risk of children's longstanding respiratory problems. Results: Among children 0 - 2, maternal education and material hardship had indirect effects on respiratory problems mediated through more proximal variables. After adjustment for maternal education, the effect of lone parenthood was partially mediated through material hardship and maternal smoking. Adjustment for socioeconomic status variables attentuated but did not eliminate the effect of maternal smoking (odds ratio= 2. 04, 95 % confidence interval= 1. 30, 3. 20). Among children 3 - 11, the effect of maternal education was partially mediated through proximal variables. Lone parenthood and material hardship had <b>indirect</b> effects only. <b>Adjustment</b> for confounding eliminated the effect of maternal smoking (odds ratio= 1. 06, 95 % confidence interval= 0. 88, 1. 26). Conclusions: Reducing childhood longstanding respiratory problems will require attention to background socioeconomic status factors in addition to maternal smoking...|$|R

We evaluated BCI 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s association with cosmic radiation dose and circadian rhythm disruption among 6, 093 female former U. S. flight attendants. MethodsWe collected questionnaire data on BCI and {{risk factors for}} breast cancer from 200222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2005. We conducted analyses to evaluate (i) BCI in the cohort compared to the U.

S. population could explain BCI that differed from expectation. ResultsBCI was elevated but {{may be explained by}} lower parity and older AFB in the cohort than among U. S. women. BCI was not associated with exposure metrics in the cohort overall. Significant positive associations with both were observed only among women with parity of three or more.

40|$|Alliances {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{in the past and}} various arguments have been suggested to explain their evolution and eventual termination. We argue that one important explanation of alliance termination has remained overlooked, one where the mechanism revolves around resource value and is independent of any mismanagement, opportunism, lack of trust, interpretive misunderstanding, or perceptions of inequity. In this explanation, we recognize explicitly that resources undergo transformation through an alliance, and this transformation reveals new previously imperfectly predicted costs to remain in the alliance as well as new opportunities outside the alliance. We apply the concepts of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs and inter-temporal economies of scope to explain these phenomena and demonstrate that, depending on the particular structure of incentive asymmetry between the two firms after alliance formation, the new circumstances may motivate a revised cost/profit sharing arrangement, a change in ownership of alliance resources, or a complete dissolution of the alliance. Some determinants of adjustment costs are explored in detail, covering resource characteristics, resource combination characteristics, and environment characteristics. Based on the economics of resource value, our argument has implications not just for alliance evolution and termination but also provides a distinct lens to explain the evolution of firm boundaries and the manner of transition of alliances into acquisitions...|$|E

In an attempt to better understand how {{the influence of the}} seasonal factor works for the prices of agricultural products, this paper has the objective of analyzing the seasonal behavior the Cost of Basic Basket series (basic food) in Lavras, MG, and its components, besides making a comparison between the direct and indirect form of the disseasonalize the series of Cost of Basic Basket. The data were obtained from the UFLA Department of Administration and Economics and cover the period from January 1995 to December 2005. The database consists of the time series of the 17 products that make up the Food Basket of Lavras, plus the series of the Cost of Basic Basket. The results elicited that eleven of the eighteen series analyzed presented identified seasonality, and then for each series models Sarima were adjusted. Finally, by comparing in a directly and indirectly way the removal of seasonality of the series, the research proved that the direct way is more effective.

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach {{to estimate the}} total number of pregnancies that begin in a population during one calendar year and the probability of spontaneous abortion is described. This includes an indirect estimate of the number of pregnancies that result in spontaneous abortions. The method simultaneously takes into account the proportion of induced abortions that are censored by spontaneous abortions and vice versa in order to estimate the true annual number of spontaneous and induced abortions for a population. It also estimates the proportion of pregnancies that women intended to allow to continue to a live birth. The proposed <b>indirect</b> approach derives <b>adjustment</b> factors to make indirect estimates by combining vital statistics information on gestational age at induced abortion (from the 12 States that report to the National Center for Health Statistics) with a life table of spontaneous abortion probabilities. The adjustment factors are applied to data on induced abortions from the Alan Guttmacher Institute Abortion Provider Survey and data on births from U. S. vital statistics. For the United States in 1980 the probability of a spontaneous abortion is 19 percent, given the presence of induced abortion. Once the effects of spontaneous abortion are discounted, women in 1980 intended to allow 73 percent of their pregnancies to proceed to a live birth. One medical benefit to a population practicing induced abortion is that induced abortions avert some spontaneous abortions, leading to a lower mean gestational duration at the time of spontaneous abortion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare efficacy and safety among novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which have not been directly compared in randomized control trials to date. MethodWe performed network meta-analyses of randomized control trials in preventing thromboembolic events and major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for published studies and various registries of clinical trials for unpublished studies were searched for 2002 – 2013. All phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NOACs (apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban), idraparinux, and ximelagatran were reviewed. ResultsA systematic literature search identified nine phase III RCTs for primary analyses. The efficacy of each NOAC was similar with respect to our primary composite endpoint following adjustment for open label designs [odds ratios (ORs) versus vitamin K antagonists: apixaban 0. 79; dabigatran 150 mg 0. 77; edoxaban 60 mg 0. 87; rivaroxaban 0. 86] except for dabigatran 110 mg and edoxaban 30 mg. Apixaban and edoxaban 30 mg and 60 mg had significantly fewer major bleeding events than dabigatran 150 mg, ricvaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonists. All NOACs were similar in reducing secondary endpoints with the exception of dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg which were associated with a significantly greater incidence of myocardial infarction compared to apixaban, edoxaban 60 mg, and rivaroxaban. ConclusionsOur <b>indirect</b> comparison with <b>adjustment</b> for study design suggests that the efficacy of the examined NOACs is similar across drugs, but that some differences in safety and risk of myocardial infarction exist, and that open label study designs appear to overestimate safety and treatment efficacy. Differences in study design should be taken into account in the interpretation of results from RCTs of NOACs...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{research}} on childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has utilized demographic factors (e. g., the gender, age, and race/ethnicity of the child victim) and specific characteristics of the abusive experience (e. g., the severity of abuse, the relationship between the perpetrator and the child victim, the child 2 ̆ 7 s age at the onset of abuse, etc.) as predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 s adjustment. Unfortunately, the ability of such factors to predict children 2 ̆ 7 s adjustment consistently across studies has been limited. Alternatively, while it has been recognized that survivors of CSA often hail from dysfunctional family environments and that the disclosure of CSA frequently results in emotional distress for caregivers, less research has focused on how these factors may serve to influence sexually abused children 2 ̆ 7 s adjustment. This study included 163 sexually abused youth and their non-offending caregivers who completed measures of psychological adjustment and the family environment. Demographic information and abuse-related characteristics were also collected. Children 2 ̆ 7 s age, gender, and race/ethnicity were not significantly predictive of emotional adjustment. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of total abuse severity, caregiver distress, and children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of their family environments as predictors of emotional adjustment. Results indicated that both children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of their family environments and total abuse severity were significantly predictive of children 2 ̆ 7 s emotional adjustment, whereas caregiver distress did not have significant direct or <b>indirect</b> effect on <b>adjustment.</b> Finally, the implications of these findings for future research and the development of effective interventions for sexually abused children and their families was discusse...|$|R
