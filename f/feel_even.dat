It's pinker than Pepto-Bismol {{and just}} as soothing, and for {{whatever}} reason, Mariah's fudged enunciation on the chorus turns 'I'm that chick you like' into 'I'll have chicken, lite.' The triumph of the song is that, when all of our dance-floor divas these days seem to throw one disco-descendant banger on their otherwise hip-hop-hybrid LPs almost out of obligation, 'I'm That Chick' doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> as tokenistic as Janet's 'Feedback' (which I like more, but only out of context).|$|E

However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E

500|$|Skyrim {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. The {{removal of the}} character class system, present in previous The Elder Scrolls entries, was well received. Billy Shibley of Machinima's Inside Gaming and Charles Onyett of IGN praised its removal because it allowed players to experiment with different skills without having {{to make decisions about}} a class early in the game. John Bedford of Eurogamer stated that by removing the character class system, the game tailored itself to players who wanted to build an all-around character, while still letting other players specialize in a preferred play-style. Steve Butts of The Escapist considered the addition of perks to the character development system [...] "a great method to make your character <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> more unique and personal". Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot praised the way perks allowed for the player's preferred skills to become more powerful over time, stating that the perk system [...] "forms around the way you play, but allows for tweaking so that you retain a sense of control". The user interface was also praised by reviewers for its accessibility; Bedford complimented its [...] "elegant design" [...] which succeeded Oblivions comparatively complex interface.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{reworking}} of Madonna's older hits like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] gave them a campy, Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor; he added that [...] " [...] help give the disc a cohesive <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> if the live performance, like the album it's hawking, is kind of humorless. That said, as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home." [...] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} of the console praises its support toward {{development of the}} Sega Genesis, but is generally critical of its small game library. Writing for AllGame, Dave Beuscher notes that [...] "it was doomed {{by the lack of}} third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992." [...] On the other hand, Retro Gamer praised the system's PAL library as a [...] "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives", noting that it was significantly larger than its North American library. Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, [...] "Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original IP and even create a mascot {{in the form of the}} lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd." [...] In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website IGN, behind both of its main competitors, the Atari 7800 (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). IGN cited the Master System's small games library, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, [...] "Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> more painful." ...|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{the theme}} of the tour was highly {{influenced}} by Shakira's political views, and this was prominently seen during the performance of [...] "Octavo Día", a song from Dónde Están los Ladrones?, during which a film showing puppet caricatures of George W.

During the opening of the concert shows, a [...] "massive" [...] stage curtain showing a [...] "mongoose and a cobra preparing for battle" [...] split and a giant cobra slowly began rising from the centre of the stage to reveal Shakira, who wore [...] "black leather pants and a black bikini top" [...] and performed barefoot. Shakira incorporated belly dancing moves in her performances and often played various instruments throughout the shows herself, including the harmonica. Eight songs from Laundry Service were included on the setlist of the tour. A more afro-punk oriented version of [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] was performed and featured instrumentation from bongos. As an intro to [...] "Rules", Shakira played the harmonica, guitar, and drums. She also played an electric guitar during the performance of [...] "Fool". [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] was included in the encore segment of the shows and was [...] "made to <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> more celebratory by the massive amount of confetti shot on the crowd midway through." [...] Shakira also performed covers of [...] "Dude Looks Like a Lady", a song by American hard rock band Aerosmith, and [...] "Back in Black", a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. Many performances made use of pyrotechnics and [...] "six-foot flames that shot from the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

500|$|Castiel {{typically}} displays {{very little}} emotion and always exhibits an extremely somber disposition. Although {{it has been}} suggested angels possibly do not possess the ability to truly feel emotion, Castiel frequently exhibits affection towards Dean. This attachment and growing ability to <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> causes him to be [...] "demoted", as his superiors fear emotions are clouding his judgment. Throughout his appearances in the fourth season, he also seems to, at the very least, come close to expressing regret, hesitance, and anger several times, and has once quietly laughed at a joke Dean made in [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Actor Misha Collins feels, through Dean, [...] " [...] learning a little bit about humanity and re-learning something about [...] own humanity from that exposure. So...there's a humanizing of Castiel going on." [...] Castiel begins having an internal struggle between what is right and what is wrong, and whether or not to obey orders from Heaven. Collins feels this is because interactions with Sam and Dean have made the angel [...] "uncertain" [...] and [...] "more fragile". Collins believes Castiel envies Dean's decisiveness and desires to emulate him. Having lost his connection to Heaven in the fifth season, Castiel's humanization seems to have quickened by the episode [...] "Free to Be You and Me", as he appears extremely anxious while in a whorehouse, is visibly distraught when asking Dean for help, and refers to the Archangel Raphael as [...] "my little bitch". Despite becoming very arrogant when he becomes the [...] "new God", Castiel still shows his caring side and ultimately returns the souls to Purgatory and shows remorse for his actions, promising to Dean {{to find a way to}} redeem himself in Dean's eyes, showing that he cares about how Dean views him. After losing his memory, Castiel is more human than ever, but still displays some of his emotionless side. [...] After his memory returns, he shows real regret when he can't undo the damage he did to Sam and essentially sacrifices himself to save him out of remorse for his actions. After Castiel wakes up from his catatonic state, he is now depicted as insane with tendencies to ramble about random topics. [...] However, parts of Castiel's original personality are still shown with him still being happy to help Sam and Dean out and still knowledgeable about various supernatural things, but not willing to actually fight anymore even when his life is threatened. Castiel describes himself as [...] "bad luck" [...] and doesn't believe he should be around the Winchesters as a result. After traveling to Purgatory, Castiel regained his sanity, but still carries a lot of guilt about his previous actions. He is also now less distant from Sam and Dean and more appreciative of human things such as television.|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed review, Sean Fennessey of Spin {{felt that}} the album does not suit Rihanna's ballad-based {{strengths}} and found her voice too flat and unexpressive to convey the anger of the songs. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal similarly said that her [...] "artistic aspirations are currently loftier than her abilities". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club viewed the music as bloated and compared its lyrics negatively to [...] "excerpts from a therapy session". Alexis Petridis, writing in The Guardian, criticized its allusions to Chris Brown's assault of her {{and said that the}} album does not offer anything beyond [...] "the public's prurient interest in her private life."

2500|$|Betza {{remarked that}} the rules of most chess variants, such as {{cylindrical}} chess or Avalanche chess, {{could be applied to}} Chess on a Really Big Board; nonetheless, he considered applying the rules of cylindrical chess to the 16×16 board [...] "silly" [...] because it made distances <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> larger, recommending Avalanche chess instead as it shortens the game. Betza also thought favourably of applying the rules of Momentum Chess to the 16×16 board. Another possibility Betza mentioned is the rules of Viennese Kriegspiel, where the middle of the board (the line between the 8th and 9th ranks) is blocked by a screen and players can move their pieces freely up to their first six ranks. Once both players are satisfied with their arrangement (this can be enforced with a timer), the screen is removed and normal play resumes. It would also be possible to play without the screen, which Betza called [...] "Sighted Viennese Kriegspiel".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{significant}} differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present. Lehman, regarding his 1997 survey, points to added discrimination and fears that {{gay and lesbian}} individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the gay community, the impact of HIV/AIDS status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of outing, and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured {{for the needs of}} heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims <b>feel</b> <b>even</b> more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status. Lehman, however, stated that [...] "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" [...] of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey. Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.|$|E
2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say what they <b>feel,</b> <b>even</b> if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E

She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me <b>feel,</b> <b>even</b> before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit."
