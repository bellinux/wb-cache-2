50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{feature of}} the M.thermoacetica CODH/ACS is an internal <b>gas</b> <b>tunnel</b> connecting the multiple active sites. The full role of the gas channel in regulating the rate catalytic activity is still a subject of investigation, but several studies {{support the notion that}} molecules of CO do in fact travel directly from the C-cluster to the ACS active site without leaving the enzyme. For instance, the rate of acetyl-CoA synthase activity in the bifunctional enzyme is not affected by the addition of hemoglobin, which would compete for CO in bulk solution, and isotopic labeling studies show that carbon monoxide derived from the C-cluster is preferentially used at the A-cluster over unlabeled CO in solution. Protein engineering of the CODH/ACS in M.thermoacetica revealed that mutating residues, so as to functionally block the tunnel, stopped acety-CoA synthesis when only CO2 was present.The discovery of a functional CO tunnel places CODH on a growing list of enzymes that independently evolved this strategy to transfer reactive intermediates from one active site to another.|$|E

40|$|The granule {{floatation}} is {{a serious}} issue of the anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) process when high loading rates are applied that results in instability or even system collapse. The present study reports the granule floatation in an anammox reactor when high loading rates were applied. The comparison of enlarged photos taken for the settling and floating granules showed that the two kinds of granules both contained macroscopic gas pockets accounting for 11 +/- 14 % of total volume. The settling granules had <b>gas</b> <b>tunnels</b> that could release the gas bubbles, while the floating granules did not. The presence of gas bubbles enclosed in the gas pockets led to the small density of 979. 2 +/- 15. 8 mg L(- 1) and flotation of anammox granules. Consequently, the flotation caused washout of anammox granules and the deterioration of anammox process (volumetric removal rate decreased from 4. 00 to 2. 46 kg N m(- 3) d(- 1)). The collection of floating granules, breaking them into small pieces and then returning to the anammox reactor proved an effective control strategy.

Microstructural studies revealed that the formation of cubic silicon carbide (C-SiC) at higher gun currents from 120 to 140 A. The SiC films have good-adhesion, dense, smooth and compact morphology.
