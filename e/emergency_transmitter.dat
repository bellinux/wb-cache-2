25|$|The Graf was {{outfitted}} {{with the most}} modern radio equipment then available. A staff of three radio operators communicated with ground stations and ships, performed radio navigation, received weather reports, and sent private telegrams for passengers. A one-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter (about 140 watt antenna power) was used to send telegrams over the low frequency (500–3,000m) bands. A 70 watt antenna power <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter</b> was available for both telegraph and radio telephone over 300–1,300m wavelength bands which could be powered by either batteries or the gasoline generator.|$|E
25|$|WCIX's {{transmission}} tower {{collapsed on}} August 24, 1992, {{as a result}} of destructive winds caused by Hurricane Andrew, forcing channel 6 off the air. Within hours, the station resumed broadcasts via its low power translator in Fort Lauderdale. WDZL began carrying WCIX's newscasts the next day, with the entire CBS schedule following a few days later. Within a week, WCIX was back on the air using an <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter</b> on a borrowed tower. In the wake of the devastation, WCIX's staff helped create Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a grass roots charitable organization which aimed to help people rebuild. The organization lives on as Neighbors 4 Neighbors, which is still supported by the station.|$|E

5000|$|On 26 May, it was {{reported}} that signals from the aircraft's <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitter</b> had been detected by satellite, which narrowed the area where the main wreckage was likely to be located on the seabed to within a radius of 5 km. An <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitter</b> usually activates at impact to send a radio distress signal; this is not the signal from an underwater locator beacon (ULB) attached to a flight recorder, which is an ultrasonic pulse. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that the <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitter</b> signal was received by satellites minutes after the airliner disappeared from radar. A [...] "distress signal" [...] received two hours after the disappearance of the aircraft, possibly originating from the <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitter,</b> had been reported already on 19 May; this report was denied by EgyptAir.|$|R

5000|$|The hand-cranked {{emergency}} {{radio transmitter}} used by crew members {{to try to}} contact the rescuers they assume are looking for them was an actual piece of equipment, a BC-778/SCR-578/AN-CRT3 <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter,</b> affectionately called [...] "Gibson Girl" [...] after the 1890s drawings of Charles Dana Gibson. The narrow-waisted shape of the device allowed the user to hold it between the legs while cranking it — a necessity, because it required 80 rpm to produce enough power to be usable, and was hard to crank.|$|E

50|$|From the 1980s, the BBC {{planned to}} {{broadcast}} {{for only a}} few hours a day and for a few minutes each hour, the intention being to conserve the batteries in domestic radios. There was to be no entertainment content for this reason and so that official messages could get through. With the end of the Cold War, the BBC deactivated the studios and <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter</b> networks in 1993 as surplus to requirements. Many of these studios have become exhibits in bunkers, like the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, which have now been converted into museums.|$|E

50|$|The oldest, {{cheapest}} (US$139) beacons are aircraft <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitters</b> (ELTs) {{that send}} an anonymous warble on the aviation band distress frequency at 121.5 MHz.

50|$|The Bendix/King KLN-90B {{controller}} {{is almost}} always linked to a GPS antenna, and may also include connections to other flight instruments such as an external Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) or horizontal situation indicator (HSI), radio-magnetic indicator (RMI), fuel management system, air data system, ARTEX ELS-10 <b>emergency</b> locator <b>transmitter</b> (ELT), autopilot, and external annunciators.|$|R
50|$|Direction finding (DF), {{or radio}} {{direction}} finding (RDF), is the measurement of the direction from which a received signal was transmitted. This can refer to radio {{or other forms of}} wireless communication, including radar signals detection and monitoring (ELINT/ESM). By combining the direction information from two or more suitably spaced receivers (or a single mobile receiver), the source of a transmission may be located via triangulation. Radio direction finding is used in the navigation of ships and aircraft, to locate <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitters</b> for search and rescue, for tracking wildlife, and to locate illegal or interfering transmitters. RDF was important in combating German threats during both the World War II Battle of Britain and the long running Battle of the Atlantic. In the former, the Air Ministry also used RDF to locate its own fighter groups and vector them to detected German raids.|$|R
50|$|Soyuz TMA-1 disembarked from ISS on May 4, 2003 and {{immediately}} began its return to Earth, marking the first entry and descent for this Soyuz class. A technical malfunction caused the Soyuz control system {{to abandon the}} gentler controlled entry and descent and instead fall back to the harsher ballistic reentry and descent. This resulted in a steep and off target landing of the spacecraft. The craft landed 300 miles short of the planned area, and the crew was subjected to severe gravitational loads. Communication with the Soyuz was lost because one antenna was ripped off during descent, and two more did not deploy. The crew regained communications through an <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter</b> after landing. Due to this event, future crews would be provided with a satellite phone to establish contact with recovery forces.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a sudden}} tornado hits the area, it draws {{the tail of}} the plane toward the shore of the lake. This {{triggered}} his thoughts {{that there may be a}} survival pack of some sorts on the plane. Brian makes a raft from a few broken off tree tops to get to the plane. When Brian is cutting his way into {{the tail of the}} plane, he drops his hatchet in the lake and dives in to get it. Once inside the plane, Brian finds a survival pack that includes additional food, an <b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter,</b> and a [...]22 rifle. Back on shore, Brian activates the transmitter, but not knowing how to use it, he thinks it is broken and throws it aside. However, his distress call is heard by a passing airplane, and he is rescued. Brian spends the remainder of the summer with his father but does not disclose his mother's affair.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, Germany {{developed}} a hand-crank 500 kHz rescue radio, the [...] "Notsender" [...] (<b>emergency</b> <b>transmitter)</b> NS2. It used two vacuum tubes and was crystal-controlled. The radio case curved inward {{in the middle}} so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the legs and above the knees, while the generator handle was turned. The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. United States Army Air Forces aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the Gibson Girl because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame box kite, and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was 500 kHz at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of 200 mi. Keying could be automatic SOS, or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. {{during the war and}} the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.|$|E
