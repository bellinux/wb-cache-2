5|$|Together, {{they went}} to see Kutuzov, who nonchalantly gave his permission. There was no clear plan and no {{objectives}} had been drawn up, the whole manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a feint. Uvarov and Platov thus set off, having just around 8000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total, and no infantry support. As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west, they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène's IV Corps. This was towards midday, just as the Viceroy was <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet {{apparently}} never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E

5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
