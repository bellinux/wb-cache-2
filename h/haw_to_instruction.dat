Slaves were a {{valuable}} asset, and their owner also owned their offspring, so ensuring that female slaves gave birth was of paramount importance.

The work is focused on the acquisition of especially civil and social but also professional and key competences. It presents the role of teachers in the educational effects on pupils in order to teach them mutual respect and tolerance of new cultures and people from different environment and to prevent potential conflict situations. It should reveal pupils <b>haw</b> <b>to</b> listen to other people regardless whether the other one agrees with them or not, and to prepare them for life in the global society on the principle of social reconciliation and solidarity...|$|R
