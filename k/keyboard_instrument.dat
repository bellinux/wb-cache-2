5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument.</b> For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E

25|$|Bach wrote many {{works for}} harpsichord, {{some of which}} may have been played on the clavichord. The larger works are usually {{intended}} for a harpsichord with two manuals, while performing them on a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> with a single manual (like a piano) may provide technical difficulties for the crossing of hands. Many of his keyboard works are anthologies that encompass whole theoretical systems in an encyclopaedic fashion.|$|E
25|$|The Marriage of Figaro is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings; the recitativi are {{accompanied}} by a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument,</b> usually a fortepiano or a harpsichord, often joined by a cello. The instrumentation of the recitativi is not given in the score, so {{it is up to}} the conductor and the performers. A typical performance usually lasts around 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{during the}} Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any {{stringed}} <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> was {{often described as}} a virginals, and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and {{not only on the}} virginals as we call it today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a pair of virginals, which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a double virginals (see below).|$|E

Rock Band 3 is designed as a platform to take advantage of players' existing libraries by providing user-created set lists and challenges and tools to easily search and select songs from the library.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to develop {{electric}} sound technology. The first electric musical instrument was the Denis d'or, which was built by Vaclav Prokop Dovis in 1753. It was incorporated with 700 strings temporarily electrified to enhance their sonic qualities. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde developed the clavecin électrique. This was a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> incorporated with plectra and activated by electricity. But both instruments were not using electricity to produce sound. Elisha Gray invented an electric musical instrument called the musical telegraph. It made sound from an electromagnetic circuit's vibration. He incorporated a basic single note oscillator. Next he added a loudspeaker consisting of diaphragm to make data audible.|$|E
25|$|Cowell's {{interest}} in harmonic rhythm, {{as discussed in}} New Musical Resources, led him in 1930 to commission Léon Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch. The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen different rhythmic patterns simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.|$|E

25|$|A <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> was {{introduced}} with Rock Band 3. Using a special adapter, players can use any MIDI-compatible electronic keyboard to play such parts with the game. A special MIDI-compatible 25-key keyboard is manufactured by Mad Catz and is bundled {{with sales of}} the new game. This unit is shaped like a keytar and is possible to play both sitting down or standing up. The unit's neck contains the Overdrive activation button, and a touchstrip that acts as an effects bar to alter {{the tone of the}} instrument. The keyboard unit is not necessary to play non-Pro keyboard parts in Rock Band 3 as any compatible guitar controller can also be used; similarly, the keyboard can be used to play any non-Pro guitar or bass parts. However, a keyboard unit is required for the Pro versions of keyboard parts, and can only be played by a keyboard.|$|E
25|$|The Flemish school, in {{particular}} the Ruckers family, produced a special type of virginals known as Mother and Child (moeder und kind). This consisted of two instruments in one: a normal virginals (either spinet or muselar) with one (say) 6′ register, and an ottavino with one 3′ register. The smaller ottavino was stored (rather like a drawer) under the soundboard next to the keyboard of the larger instrument, and could be withdrawn and played as a separate <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument.</b> However, the two instruments could also be coupled together, the ottavino being placed over the strings of the larger virginals (once the jackrail was removed), so that the jacks of the latter passed through a slot {{in the bottom of}} the ottavino. The jacks of the larger instrument now activated the keys of the ottavino, so that both instruments sounded simultaneously, giving a more brilliant effect.|$|E
25|$|Vicentino's {{most famous}} {{invention}} was the archicembalo, a keyboard containing thirty-one {{keys to the}} octave. Using this keyboard, {{it was possible to}} play acoustically satisfactory intervals in any key, and therefore some of the recently composed music in a chromatic style, which was only in tune when sung, could be played on the keyboard. Later he applied the same keyboard layout to the arciorgano, a microtonal keyboard for the organ. While these keyboards did not achieve wide popularity, they did offer a way of playing music in meantone temperament in all keys. The standard way to modulate through all keys on a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument</b> later became to divide the octave into twelve equal parts, called 12-tone equal temperament, in which the major and minor thirds are not well tuned. Vicentino's solution in effect divides the octave into 31 equal parts, with good intonation for the thirds and sixths but somewhat beating narrow fifths.|$|E
