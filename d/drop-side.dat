2500|$|WP {{acquired}} some {{rolling stock}} from CN's Newfoundland operations, which {{shut down in}} November 1988; the acquisition included 8 side-pivot, <b>drop-side</b> air dump cars for large rocks, and 8 longitudinal hoppers for ballast, still painted in CN orange. These cars were converted from Newfoundland's [...] gauge to White Pass and Yukon Route's 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge.|$|E

The mare seemed to be sinking by the stern, and her {{nostrils}} cracked while she was trying to realise what was happening. The rain of the night before had rotted the <b>drop-side</b> of the Himalayan-Thibet Road, and it was giving way under her. 'What are you doing?' said the Man's Wife. The Tertium Quid gave no answer. He grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare, who rapped with her forefeet on the road, and the struggle began. The Man's Wife screamed, 'Oh, Frank, get off!' ...|$|E

50|$|Finally, in 1968 {{its body}} got a {{complete}} redesign. The new model now {{looked more like}} a car with the aspect of a tougher vehicle. Its design featured a bodywork made entirely of steel with fully floating cab and separate cargo section for the two door models while the cab and box were built into an integrated assembly for the four doors models. However, there were also models that still had flat beds with wooden boxes and <b>drop-sides.</b> In addition to its aesthetics, its powertrain had been modified as well. The new model came equipped with an Indenor XD 4.88 52hp 4-cylinder diesel engine sourced from Peugeot, with a 4-speed gear box. Despite this motor change, Borgward continued to provide transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|Soon thereafter, in September 1976, {{the interim}} ST10 (only built for four months) was {{gradually}} {{replaced by the}} widened and lengthened ST20 pickup version which also has a longer wheelbase. Marketed as the Suzuki Carry Wide 550, it now reached the maximum dimensions set for the Kei class. In November, the ST20 Van took its bow - this version was 4 cm shorter than the truck as it reused the shorter rear side bodypanels of the L50 and ST10 versions. Some special variants of the ST10 (such as refrigerated versions, panel vans, etcetera) remained on sale alongside the ST20 {{for a little while}} longer until new versions could be developed. There was also an ST20K model available. The [...] "K" [...] referred to the [...] "trucklike" [...] nature of the vehicle in that it had three <b>drop-sides</b> as opposed to the utility version which had only a tailgate and formed sides. The ST20 range retained the three-cylinder 539 cc two-stroke engine of the ST10 and has a carrying capacity of 350 kg. Maximum power remained [...] at 4500 rpm. In October 1977, after about 187,000 had been built, the ST20 underwent a light facelift, with increased equipment and all versions (excepting the base truck) now featuring a front grille.|$|R
50|$|The M55, with an extra-long wheelbase, had a 20 ft box. There was no <b>drop-side</b> {{version of}} the M814.|$|E
50|$|Fuschillo also {{sponsored}} a statewide ban on over-the-counter products containing the dangerous dietary supplement ephedra. Fuschillo has authored child safety laws, and helped secure new educational technology for local school districts. Additionally, he {{sponsored a}} statewide ban on dangerous <b>drop-side</b> cribs, {{which have been}} linked to numerous child deaths and injuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} AU Falcon Utility {{vehicles}} {{was launched in}} June 1999. It offered Falcon XL, XLS, XR6 and XR8 style side utility models, a cab-chassis model and a cab-chassis with factory fitted <b>drop-side</b> tray. The latter was the first tray utility vehicle that Ford Australia had produced for several years.|$|E
5000|$|WP&YR {{acquired}} some {{rolling stock}} from CN's Newfoundland operations, which {{shut down in}} November 1988; the acquisition included 8 side-pivot, <b>drop-side</b> air dump cars for large rocks, and 8 longitudinal hoppers for ballast, still painted in CN orange. These cars were converted from Newfoundland's [...] gauge to White Pass and Yukon Route's 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge.|$|E
50|$|The Damas microvan is {{available}} as a 7-seat coach, 5-seat coach, or 2-seat cargo van styles and comes with various options based on DLX (deluxe) and SUPER models. The Labo is also available in STD (standard), DLX (deluxe) and SUPER models. Two main choices of the Labo body type are the cube van and the <b>drop-side</b> pickup truck. The pickup has an optional electric tailgate lift.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{body was}} a 2-door, 3 seater pickup {{with a separate}} well body (with a fold down tailgate). Other bodies advertised by Toyota included a van, an ambulance, double cab coupe utility (2-doors, 6 seater, integral well body), <b>drop-side</b> pickup, pickup with stake sides, a pickup with full height metal side with a canvas top, a light bus (precursor to the Coaster) and an ice cream van.|$|E
50|$|As {{noted the}} {{original}} basic gasoline-powered truck variants were first the M34, {{and then the}} M35. A long wheel-base variant, designated the M36, was also developed (featuring a 16 ft cargo bed). Variants with a C suffix (such as M35A2C or M36A2C) featured a straight <b>drop-side</b> cargo bed. The M44 and M45 were simply the chassis designation for the 2½-ton series, and this cab/chassis would {{serve as the basis}} for many more specialized variants.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, {{after the}} 1302 was dropped, the Dacia 1304 single-cab pick-up and <b>drop-side</b> models were introduced, {{followed}} by 1307/1309 double cab models in 1992, the 1305, a front-wheel drive {{version of the}} pick-up model, in 1994, and a king cab model, in 1995. These model lines were a commercial success and remained in production, and were gradually face lifted and modified, {{along with the rest}} of the range, until December 2006.|$|E
50|$|The original, {{integral}} pick-up had {{now been}} dropped {{in favour of}} a <b>drop-side</b> pick-up built on the Sherpa chassis-cab. The 255 and 280 chassis-cabs were also available on their own, ready to receive bespoke bodywork. Engine availability continued unaltered, with 1.7 and 2.0-litre O-series petrol units, the 1.8-litre B-series diesel and the option of a Landi-Hartog LPG conversion, first introduced at the launch of Freight Rover the year before. A 4WD Sherpa van was also now offered.|$|E
50|$|A {{two-wheel drive}} {{variant of the}} 450 was {{announced}} on 12 December 1961, with the 450's 2300 mm wheelbase and engine, as the 451 (van), 451D (<b>drop-side</b> pickup), 451A (ambulance), and 451B (minibus). The ambulance spawned a prototype UAZ-452GP with hydropneumatic suspension, to enable it to cross rough ground at high speed, following on the work done by Citröen on the DS19. The system proved very successful on trials, but it {{was rejected by the}} Red Army as too complicated, and so never entered production.|$|E
50|$|Cab-over or {{cab forward}} designs have the cab sitting above the front axle. An early cab-forward <b>drop-side</b> pickup was the Volkswagen Transporter, {{introduced}} in 1952. This configuration {{is more common}} among European and Japanese manufacturers than in North America, since the style allows a longer cargo area for the same overall length. The design was more popular in North America in the 1950s and '60s, examples including the Chevrolet Corvair Rampside & Loadside, Dodge A-100 & A-108, Ford Econoline & Jeep FC-150 & FC-170.|$|E
50|$|A Luton-style {{body was}} offered, {{built on the}} 255 chassis-cab, {{providing}} a capacity of , and a maximum payload of almost 2 tonnes. The chassis-cab also {{formed the basis for}} <b>drop-side</b> pick-ups, in 255, 280 and 285 versions, again available with either short- or long-wheelbases. Of course, the chassis-cab could also be ordered on its own, again in a choice of lengths, so that bespoke bodywork could be fitted, with the added option of either single or double cabs. The 200 series continued to be offered as minibus or crewbus.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version had a pressed-steel cab with a truck-like configuration {{similar to the}} wheeled trucks. The next two versions - RSO/02 and 03 - had a simpler, soft-top, slab-sided metal cab. All models had wooden, <b>drop-side</b> cargo beds typical of light trucks of the era. It had a ground clearance of 55 cm and was originally powered by a gasoline Steyr V8 cylinder engine of 3.5 l giving , which in the RSO/03 Magirus-produced vehicles {{was replaced by a}} better-performing (although lower powered -66 hp) Deutz diesel air-cooled engine.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, UAZ began {{production}} of the UAZ-450 series of trucks and vans. The first model was the 450A ambulance; with room for two stretchers and four-wheel drive, it was arguably {{the best in the}} world for use in remote areas. It was followed by the 450D <b>drop-side</b> pickup, which had an 800 kg payload; the 450 van, with a 750 kg payload; and the 11-seat 450V microbus. All the 450 series were capable of disconnecting the front drive axle and of reaching 56 mph, achieving fuel economy of , and of towing an 850 kg trailer.|$|E
5000|$|The M49 fuel tanker and M50 {{water tanker}} {{variants}} were initially {{based on the}} M44 chassis. The M49C series, however, were vehicles converted from C series <b>drop-side</b> cargo variants. M49's have 1200-gallon tanks. Early models had triple compartments (200g front, 400g mid, baffled 600g rear), but most models have two 600-gallon baffled tanks. The M50 had a [...] water tank, of which later variants had internal baffles to combat weight transfer during motion. In some areas the M35 is still used today as a wildland firefighting truck with a portable water supply and fully operational pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{cargo bed}} can vary in size {{according}} to whether the vehicle is optimized for cargo utility or passenger comfort. Most have fixed side walls and a hinged tailgate. Cargo beds are normally found in two styles: step-side or fleet-side. A step-side bed has fenders which extend {{on the outside of}} the cargo area. A fleet-side bed has wheel-wells inside the bed. The first fleet-sided truck was the 1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier. Early trucks had wood plank beds, which were replaced by steel by the 1960s. Some European-style trucks use a <b>drop-side</b> bed with a flat tray with hinged panels rising up on the sides and the rear.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, {{its name}} was changed into Dacia 1310 and later also came [...] "1410", [...] "1210" [...] {{and a few}} others. New {{versions}} of Dacia Pick-Up were introduced starting 1981. In 1983 the whole range was facelifted for the 1984 model year. A coupé version of the car, the 1410 Sport, with two doors and a lowered roof, was also released in 1983. [...] In 1985 the <b>drop-side</b> coupé utility (pick up) was introduced and in 1987 the Dacia 1320 liftback. In 1989 the production for the facelifted 1310 sedan, van and estate was over, although the pick up continued until 1990. The 1320 stopped in 1990.|$|E
50|$|The TN360 premiered in November 1967 and {{remained}} in production unchanged until January 1970. Top speed is 100 km/h, {{the same as}} for its predecessor. Thanks to a simpler construction, weight dropped considerably: from 610 kg for the old T360 to 500 kg for the 1967 TN360. Output remained unchanged at 30 PS (22 kW) at 8,000 rpm, but torque increased somewhat to 3.0 kgm Nm at 5,500 rpm and everything occurred in a lower engine speed range. The engine benefited from engineering efforts achieved on the Honda 1300 four cylinder, air-cooled sedan introduced in 1969. The TN also had a considerably tighter turning circle, at 7.6 metres. The only bodywork available was as a <b>drop-side</b> pickup truck.|$|E
5000|$|The first Alfa Romeo T10 [...] "Autotutto" [...] ("all purpose") was {{presented}} in 1954 Turin Motor Show as panel and minibus version. Later more versions came available as Alfa Romeo made themselves with very many body versions: van, high roof van, [...] "Promiscuo" [...] (van with additional side windows and rear seating), minibus, school bus, ambulance, pick-up, <b>drop-side</b> truck and double cab truck. In addition to this many coachbuilding companies made their own versions. The van used the 1,290 cc Alfa Romeo Twin Cam straight-four engine detuned to [...] and it had top speed of 60 mph. This engine was later used on Giulietta Berlina. The optional two-cylinder supercharged diesel engine had [...]|$|E
50|$|In May 1976, {{responding}} to changed {{standards for the}} Kei class, Suzuki released the Carry 55, chassis code ST10/ST10V. It had the larger, water-cooled but still two-stroke three-cylinder LJ50 engine of 539 cc but was otherwise hard to distinguish from the preceding L50 series. The only two differences in appearance were bigger (albeit slimmer) bumpers which no longer enveloped {{the bottom of the}} front, as well as slightly altered doors with a slight bump in the swage line to accommodate the door handle. There was also an ST11 version with a <b>drop-side</b> bed. The ST10 (along with the LC20 Fronte) was the first Suzuki to enter CKD production in Indonesia, in 1976. In 1977 it was replaced by the larger ST20.|$|E
5000|$|The new '30 Suzuki Carry (the [...] "Suzulight" [...] label {{was being}} retired) {{was a full}} cab-over design, with the same FB engine mounted {{horizontally}} underneath the load area. The starter and generator were combined and mounted directly {{on the front of}} the crankshaft. Introduced in February 1966, the L30 was built alongside its more traditional predecessor until they were both replaced by the L40. A canopied L30H, similar to the L20H but with the seats in the bed facing each other, was available right from the start. There was also an L31, with a <b>drop-side</b> bed. Performance and mechanics were very similar to its bonneted sister, but the load area was considerably larger. Maximum load capacity was still 350 kg.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} needed yet more space, a Luton-style body was offered, built {{on either the}} 255 or 350 chassis-cabs, {{providing}} capacities of 11.3 m³ (400 cu. ft) (with 200 series cab) or 15.6 m³ (550 cu. ft) (300 series), and a maximum payload of almost 2 tonnes. The chassis-cab also {{formed the basis for}} a standard- and wide-bodied <b>drop-side</b> pick-up, in 255, 280, 285, 310 and 350 versions, again available with either short- or long-wheelbases. Of course, the chassis-cab could also be ordered on its own, again in a choice of widths and lengths, so that bespoke bodywork could be fitted, with the added option of either single or double cabs. The 200 series continued to be offered as minibus or crewbus, but the 300 series was also offered as a minicoach seating up to 18 people.|$|E
5000|$|Restoration is in {{progress}} {{on a number of}} narrow gauge waggons. The railway owns 9 RNAD wagons. A set of 3 RNAD box vans and 6 RNAD flats. The vans and 3 flats have been regauged from 2ft 6in and to run on the line, with 1 van 3 flats been fully restored, one of these flats has been rebuilt into a ballast wagon ('Minnow') the later 3 flats had recently arrived from Chasewater Railway. The wheelsets and frames are currently separated, with the 2ft 6in wheels currently in Amerton Yard, and the frames up at 'stump siding'. These are to be fully restored when time and finances allow [...] 3 ex- RAF Fauld <b>drop-side</b> wagons have been restored and painted in RAF colours during 2016, as well as 2 ex MOD flats, one rebuilt too a short sided wagon, the other to the original MOD high end sided flats. There are 5 600mm Allen skips on the railway, they have recently been taken off from mainline running, due to skips buckets deterioration, and the wheelset 600mm gauge meaning they would derail at times. Plans are being made to regauge and replace the wheelsets to running order.|$|E
50|$|The Llama prototypes {{were sent}} to the MoD for testing. These were fitted with a variety of rear bodies to {{demonstrate}} the versatility of the design. These included the standard open <b>drop-side</b> rear tray, the 'General Service' version with a removable canvas hood, a demountable glass-fibre 'pod' that could be loaded and unloaded from the chassis by a hydraulic hook, a solid enclosed rear body (mocked-up as both an Ambulance and a radio communications vehicle) and one example was fitted with a mock-up missile launcher. Vehicles were subjected to load-carrying, off-road driving, stability, cold-weather and endurance/performance tests. These showed several flaws with the design. The main one was that the coil-spring suspension and high centre of gravity led to poor stability over rough ground when fully laden. The performance of the 2.5-ton vehicle was poor, especially when loaded. The petrol engine fitted to the Llama was also a problem, as the MOD had recently standardised on diesel power for all its vehicles. The V8 was Land Rover's most powerful engine available, and bringing in a more powerful diesel from another builder would remove the Llama's key selling feature- its parts commonality with the standard Land Rovers (of which the MoD had a fleet of nearly 20,000).|$|E
50|$|The Caterpillar design {{did well}} in testing, and in 1960 the company was awarded a multimillion-dollar {{contract}} for developing eight 8-ton cargo trucks, delivered in 1961 and 1962, {{as well as two}} 10-ton wreckers and two 2500-gallon tankers in 1962. Another twenty-three units were ordered in 1963, and field-tested in Germany in 1964, and later in Vietnam in 1966. Not until 1971 did Caterpillar eventually receive a production contract for 1300 units: 812 M520 cargo-vehicles, 371 M559 tankers and 117 M553 wreckers. Production began in 1972 and lasted through June 1976. When fitted with its own crane, the cargo variant would be designated M877.Not only did the Caterpillar offer extreme off-road ability, including 20° longitudinal articulation and 30° side-slopes, it was also fully amphibious, using the wheels for propulsion in the water. The rear cargo-bed tailgate and <b>drop-side</b> doors, that allowed rapid discharge of cargo, had watertight seals to preserve the unit's swimming capability. In the US’s involvement in the Vietnam War, the Goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not, {{and it was one of}} the preferred resupply vehicles after the pre-production units' introduction in 1966. They achieved a 90% availability rate even though spare parts for the Goer were not an official part of the US Army inventory until 1972.|$|E
50|$|The {{designers}} {{were still}} {{coming up with}} fresh ideas, many of them shrouded in secrecy. Prototypes such as the 500cc Mini-Dacia, as well as Dacia 1310 variants, were designed; some, such as the Dacia 1310 Limousine, {{are still on the}} road. These cars are eagerly prized by Dacia enthusiasts, and Dacia web forums are full of evidence about the rarities and oddities produced by Dacia during the 1980s.In 1982, after the 1302 was dropped, the Dacia 1304 Pick-up and <b>Drop-side</b> models were introduced. Actually, they had been launched from 1981. These were a commercial success and remained in production, gradually being modified {{along with the rest of}} the range, until December 2006. From 1985, also, the 1410 was available as a larger-engined variant, while the relatively short-lived 1210 was the economy variant until about 1992.For the 1984 model year, the de luxe MS and MLS models presented slight modifications on the 1310 platform, with a new spoiler and chunkier, rubber mouldings around the front grille and headlamps. In 1985, the rear vent was changed from a narrow horizontal aperture to a rhomboid aperture, much like that of the Renault 12 phase 2. From late 1985 all models had the large rubber mouldings around the front grille and headlamps, plus a spoiler: the line-up was changed to TX and TLX, though other designations were occasionally seen. A five-speed gearbox also became an option. Models destined for Canada (initially called GTL) sported twin fuel tanks. In parallel, work was developing on the 1320 CN1 model, which was a hatchback based on the 1310. The new front end seen on the 1320 also appeared on the top-of-the-range and special-order models from about 1986; these cars were distinguishable by two large headlights, a much plusher interior clad in blue plastic and a new dashboard known as the CN1, and - occasionally - faired-in door handles. Many were owned by senior officials in the Communist Central Committee. While the 1320 was the most expensive model in the Dacia range when it appeared in 1988, many were used as taxis. The 1320 did not last long, however; as early as 1989 there were prototypes using the front of the 1320 and a new rear, with wrap-around tail lights and other (relatively) modern features.|$|E
