Therefore, the effect of crispy rolls morphology on crust crispness was studied. Crispy rolls were prepared at three proving volumes: 300 mL (short proving), 500 mL (control) and 800 mL (long proving). X-ray microtomography was used to characterize morphology. Water transport from crumb to crust was determined. Short proved crispy rolls showed lower rate of crust water uptake while longer proved rolls showed faster uptake during cooling down. Sensory analysis revealed higher crispness for short proved crispy rolls after the same storage time at low RH. We hypothesize that shorter proved crispy rolls with finer crumb morphology, more closed structure, smaller gas cells with less <b>gas</b> cells <b>interconnections</b> and a thicker crust have a significant positive effect on water uptake kinetics and crispness retention. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Baltic {{countries}} do not form a homogenous region {{in terms of}} energy mixes, supply patterns and policy objectives. Estonia is largely self-sufficient depending on the domestic oil shale production. Natural gas accounts for a slightly more than 10 % of the Estonia’s primary energy balance. Lithuania has turned from a regional nuclear power into a largely gas consuming country while attempting to achieve an ambitious „energy independence” objective through various large scale measures: a new nuclear power plant in Visagina, an LNG terminal in Klaipeda, electricity and <b>gas</b> <b>interconnections</b> with Sweden and Poland. Although Latvia has a rather high level of single source gas consumption (around 30 %), it {{wants to become a}} regional gas distribution hub. Latvia’s central location among the Baltics and, more importantly, vast underground storage potential provides a considerable advantage in the search for regional energy security solutions. The Baltic energy, however have considerable similarities and commonly shared broad challenges. The major challenges and objectives that the Baltics need to address are security of supply, competitive markets and sustainability. The integration of Baltic states „energy islands” into the European „energy mainland” is crucial for European Union energy policy. The European Union has facilitated the adoption of the Baltic Energy Market Integration Plan. Although the first steps have been already taken in electricity interconnections, the next phase would focus more on regional gas market integration. In this regard, interconnections between Estonia and Finland, and Lithuania and Poland are planned. The idea of the LNG-terminal has been put high on agenda in the Baltic states {{to become one of the}} important regional objectives with the help of potential EU financing. It shows, how liberal intergovernmentalism has proven right that, eventhough states are declaring cooperation, in the end of the day, the domestic interest are more important. Security of energy supply for the Baltic countries is of strategic importance from a geopolitical as well as an economic perspective. Based on relevant literature and scientific papers, it comes out that, although different strategies and development plans have great potential, they are not able to take advantage of national interest.

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{of climate change}} mechanisms Greenhouse gas emissions are of major importance today and the climate issue is expected to remain a question of utmost significance during coming decades and centuries. Climate models indicate how emissions interfere with climate processes and which temperature rise different emission scenarios may lead to. Through a literature survey, it has been our inten-tion to single {{out some of the}} findings on climate change mechanisms, such as the interac-tion between emissions of greenhouse gases and global radiative forcing, on how the carbon and nitrogen cycles interfere with concentrations in the atmosphere and in what ways cost-effective abatement measures of greenhouse gases could be made. The focus in this respect has been on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases. The present basis for action is comprehensive and robust to its order of magnitude, even if there are large uncertainties involved in the overall understanding of the processes.

40|$|Crude and {{gas from}} the Russian Federation dominates the South Eastern Europe (SEE) import portfolio. Russian {{companies}} control oil refineries in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia. Gazprom is the main gas supplier to the entire region and the only producer of domestic gas (and oil) in Serbia. Its gas export {{is associated with a}} network of subsidiaries, resellers, agents and sponsorships that are granted special rights in their respective countries of operation. This system is supported by the availability of âon demandâ credit resources that contribute to the soft budget constraint and facilitate the operation of low efficiency district heating systems, emergency power generation and inefficient (fertilizer, etc.) industries. In this governance context, and if the current supply and demand structure remains, SEE will have an increased energy security risk due its exposure to a disruption in gas supply via Ukraine. In contrast, the European Union (EU) is looking toward this region as an option to improve its security of gas supply and diversify its supply portfolio. This encourages local expectations of transit rents and {{is based on the assumption}} that the region may host the following: Southern Gas Corridor, North-South <b>Gas</b> <b>Interconnection</b> and Central/South Eastern Electricity Interconnection. There are more overlapping energy transit projects being considered than in any other region in Europe. This paper sets out a realistic roadmap that is able to overcome existing barriers and provide the desired level of security of supply: 1. Gas consumption that does not yield positive economic returns is to be phased out by energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and opening to international markets; 2. Flexible Black Sea & Balkans (BS&B) Gas Hub through the improved use of existing infrastructure; 3. BS&B Gas Hub facilitates gas trade with the rest of Europe that promotes more efficient use of gas, market opening, industrial restructuring and increased renewable energy integration â all beyond the expectations indicated in various current strategic documents...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} trading {{activity}} on Europeâs gas hubs {{and access to}} anonymised OTC price data provides the OIES Gas Programme {{with the opportunity to}} analyse and draw conclusions on issues of direct relevance to policy makers and market participants. With 2014 data available, the objective of this paper is primarily to explore the extent to which conclusions reached in the Authorâs previous papers have changed. As trading volumes and liquidity increase one would expect to see price correlations across market geography improve, and indeed this is the general trend observed in this paper. Of equal interest however are the anomalies to this trend which may be one-off or recurrent in nature. Beatrice identifies such âde-linkagesâ and with reference to the work of market monitoring groups and using data on infrastructure capacities and flowrates which has recently become more widely available, applies a forensic approach to assessing the prime causes for such episodes â whether due to physical or contractual congestion. With the IGUâs annual price survey data available at a national market level, a measure of the financial impact on consumers of such price de-linkages is also estimated, helping to focus the minds of policy makers on appropriate actions to ensure the free flow of <b>gas</b> across <b>interconnection</b> points. As the future pattern of gas flows inevitably changes over time, due to LNG import level fluctuations, pipeline import patterns changing and a more diverse supply pattern from the European core to eastern Europe and indeed Ukraine, we should expect this to be a continuing and dynamic challenge...|$|R
40|$|European Union {{energy sources}} are {{supposed}} to be sufficient to cover expected growth of natural gas demand for the coming decades, but there are not enough opportunities/infrastructure to transport these volumes of gas to European markets. Arbitrary interruptions of Russia gas deliveries towards Europe, the delays in the rehabilitation of its obsolete pipeline network, the interdiction of direct Asian gas exports transit through Russian transport infrastructure, made stringently necessary for European countries to diversify gas suppliers’ portfolio, by avoiding Russian territory. Nabucco pipeline was conceived as an alternative to European Union countries’ high dependence on Russian gas (about 40 % of their consumption is provided by Russia), by connecting European Union countries directly to the huge natural gas resources of Central Asia, on the route Turkey – Bulgaria – Romania – Hungary – Austria. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make a SWOT analysis of this project, highlighting its strengths and weakness from Romania’s point of view, as well as the opportunities and threats as external factors. The main idea resulting from the analysis is that strengths are prevailing for Romania. The turning to account of this project will ensure the diversification of gas sources and the development of competitive markets which can entail price reduction. It is supposed to be a fair and advantageous option, economically reliable, that will reduce dependence on deliveries of gas from a single source – Russia, ensuring two undeniable prerequisites: accessibility (to new supply sources) and availability (which refers to guarantees of long term sustainability of gas deliveries). The project implementation will allow energy to help to establish new structural links between the EU, Turkey and the Caspian Sea states and will ensure transfrontier cooperation possibilities inside some euro-regions already constituted, by accessing regional development funds at EU level. Its route on Romanian territory (through the plain from the southern part of the country) will be an important advantage in pipeline layout, implying lower costs. Nabucco pipeline will create the opportunity of a better connection of our NTS (National Transport System) to the European gas network. All the countries involved in the project are OTAN members, so that Nabucco can also become a vector for political stability in the Black Sea region. natural <b>gas,</b> infrastructure,, <b>interconnection,</b> energy security, supply diversification, public investment...|$|R
40|$|The EUs External Natural Gas Policy  Caught Between National Prioriti es and Supranationalism, studies EU {{external}} {{relations in the}} area of n atural gas supply with Russia and the former Soviet Republics in Central Asia. The primary question the thesis tries to answer is to assess to w hat extent Europe manages to formulate and execute its policy on natural gas towards Russia and Central Asia in a coherent manner. Moreover, wha t are the underlying causes as to why the Union does (not) succeed in do ing so? The aim of answering the above questions is to put forward an ex planation for both the current state of EU natural gas relations with Ru ssia and Central Asia, as well as their future direction. In order to aid an assessment of the future direction of EU natural gas relations with Russia and Central Asia, two theories of European in tegration are applied: (i) supranational governance theory and (ii) libe ral intergovernmentalist (LI) theory. According to the former, the integ ration of one sector leads to technical pressures pushing states to in tegrate other sectors. Based on this theory, it seems that pressures to enable the smooth operation of the internal market, allow us to explain why internal energy policy has been able to allow for European Community -level coordination, rules and dispute resolution. According to LI theor y, external energy policy by contrast rather seems to follow a more inte rgovernmental logic whereby states attain their goals through intergover nmental negotiation and bargaining, rather than through a centralised au thority making and enforcing decisions. The outcome of negotiations betw een EU Member States depends on the relative bargaining power of the act ors involved. The actors which would benefit least from a cooperative ag reement and more from the status quo are generally in a stronger positio n than those who would benefit most and can thus demand concessions from the latter. Thus, the extent to which Member States would benefit from a cooperative approach in external energy policy, or rather prefer to ke ep the status quo depends to a large extent on their perceived necessity for change. Europes long term energy security depends lar gely on its ability to establish effective dialogues and forms of cooper ation with external suppliers. Thus partly a foreign policy matter, ener gy security should, according to the EU, abide by its normative foreign policy doctrine of effective multilateralism. The ability to act effec tively however also requires the Union to organise itself efficiently in a consistent and coherent manner in cooperation with key actors involve d. Although coherence and consistency are often used interchangeably, th e two terms have different meanings. Whereas, consistency merely refers to the absence of contradiction, coherence, by contrast, implies positiv e connections and is a much broader concept. Combining the notion of coh erence with the EUs normative goal {{to live up to its}} principle of effective multilateralism, this thesis systematically engages ina comparati ve analysis of EU and Member State actions on natural gas vis-à-vis Russ ia and Central Asia to check for apparent signs of contradiction in thei r stated objectives or actions (consistency). To establish whether syner gies have actually been exploited between actors, the Unions external p olicy performance first needs to be understood: did it reach its objecti ves through enhanced unity and coordination (coherence) ? Empirically, three cases are examined in detail: (i) gas crises mana gement, (ii) (planned) pipeline projects and negotiations, and (iii) con sumer-producer relations on an institutional level. Particular attention is thereby given to the roles played by the division of competences bet ween the EU and its Member States in the field of energy, EU Treaty revi sions, the global institutional frameworks on energy governance, and ind ividual natural gas security at EU Member State level. In carrying out t he analysis, vital information is drawn from an in-depth stakeholder con sultation among key-experts involved in EU external energy relations. Th is information is complemented by document analysis and observation rese arch. The information gathered throughout the research is used to (i) ex plain how external policy on natural gas is formed; (ii) which factors d etermine the eventual outcome at EU level; and through this shed light o n (iii) the (future) direction and pace of European integration in this field. Coherence in Gas Crisis Management On 1 January 2009, natural gas delivers from Russia to Ukraine w ere halted. Reported shortages and a cut in supplies to other European c ountries followed a few days later. In January 2006, a similar crisis be tween the two countries had resulted in falling pressures and non-delive ry of gas reports by European companies. An analysis of the January 2009 crisis shows that a lack of a well-functioning exchange of up-to-date, reliable and consistent information between gas companies, as well as in adequate and fragmented information on cross-border flows served to unde rmine full effectiveness of emergency measures. On the political level, the Commissions bilateral diplomacy proved ineffective in preventing th e crisis from escalating as neither Russia, nor Ukraine acted on the EU s statements. Two clear coherence deficits in the EU s resolve can be discerned: (i) the fragmented character of information on the internal market and the coordination thereof in terms of emergenc y plans; and (ii) the sometimes haphazard manner by which bilateral dipl omacy is conducted. The Lisbon Treaty offers the Union a distinct set of actors and structures that could make for a more ambitious solution to the first problem, and solve the second problem at the same time. When a crisis occurs that carries foreign and security implications, it should be the task of the High Representative (HR) or, at the highest level, t he President of the European Council, assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS), to engage in diplomatic efforts on behalf of theE U with the aim of striking a political agreement to the crisis and ensur e full consistency and coherence. Yet, their combined efforts should be based on EU-wide information on the Unions internal market, provid ed by emergency plans coordinated at Union level under the auspices of t he Commissioner for Energy. Coherence in Pipeline Projects and Negotiations In terms of coherence, th e impact of the 2006 and 2009 Russia-Ukraine crisis on both occasions se rved to get the EU Institutions and its 27 Member States to agree on the need to diversify natural gas suppliers and transit routes, and for Eur ope to present a united position externally. This would suggest that in a narrow view, the positions of all actors were consistent. However, in terms of the execution thereof, significant discrepancies exist between the positions of the European Commission and European Parliament (EP) on the one hand, and those of the Council and EU Member States on the othe r. Whereas the Commission and EP firmly advocated diversifying natural g as supplies and transit routes away from Russia by attracting gas from t he Caspian and Central Asia, Member States acted differently. Germany struck a deal with Gazprom in early 2006 to construct a direct pipeline between the two nations underneath the Baltic Sea. Simi larly, many central and eastern European Member States in fact strengthe ned their ties to Gazprom. What undoubtedly influenced this decision is the fact that many central and eastern European Member States possess fe w <b>gas</b> pipeline <b>interconnections</b> other than eastwards and do not have the financial means to construct new routes. Overall, when taking a broad u nderstanding of coherence, Member State actions have largely undermined the positions of the European Commission and the EP concerning diversifi cation of natural gas suppliers and transit routes prior to the Lisbon T reatys entry into force. The limited coherence in this period is essent ially related to the fact that the EU possesses few competences on energ y outside of the internal market. As decisions regarding the energy mix fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States, the Russia-Ukr aine crises prompted many of the Unions members to seek individual  bi lateral, rather than multilateral  solutions to the challenges posed by the interruptions. To alter this situation, the Commission instead has argued that energy policy should rather be given its own legal basis, re questing measures to be taken in connection with related policies on the environment and the EU internal market, but not based on the latters p rovisions in the treaties. The Lisbon Treaty fulfilled this desire. Lisbons creation of a specific legal basis for energy with det ailed objectives and new actors such as the HR and EEAS had sparked high hopes for a more coherent EU external energy policy. The European Commi ssion, the EP, as well as a majority of central and eastern European EU Member States were in favour ofgreater Europeanisation of energy polic y and a stated a desire to move away from bilateral agreements. This poi nted to some degree of coherence in the views of the above mentioned act ors. Yet, Europes larger Member States still hold positions inconsisten t with these policies. This not only undermines the EUs coherence, but even its consistency. Diversification efforts are a good example. T hree years after the Treatys entry into force, intra-EU competition has rendered Nabucco  the one pipeline among three initiatives with the mo st favourable overall impact on European energy security  an unlikely c andidate to wheel in a crucial gas contract from Azerbaijan. When asked, third states confirm that Member States promoting this or th e other pipeline, followed by the Commission ushering its support for ye t another, undermines the EUs|$|R
