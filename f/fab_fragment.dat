40|$|A {{panel of}} 20 {{recombinant}} <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> reactive with the surface glycoprotein gp 120 of human type 1 immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) were examined {{for their ability}} to neutralize MN and IIIB strains of the virus. Neutralization was determined as the ability of the <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> to inhibit infection as measured in both a p 24 ELISA and a syncytium-formation assay. One group of closely sequence-related <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> was found to neutralize virus in both assays with a 50 % neutralization titer at approximately 1 micrograms/ml. Another Fab neutralized in the p 24 ELISA but not in the syncytium assay. The other <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> showed weak or no neutralizing ability. The results imply that virion aggregation or crosslinking of gp 120 molecules on the virion surface is not an absolute requirement for HIV- 1 neutralization. Further, all of the <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> were shown to be competitive with soluble CD 4 for binding to gp 120 and yet few neutralized the virus effectively, implying that the mechanism of neutralization in this case may not involve receptor blocking. The observation of a preponderance of high-affinity <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> with poor or no neutralizing ability could have implications for vaccine strategies...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a human CD 4 + T {{lymphocyte}} {{line was}} transduced to secrete <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> of a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody F 105 that reacts with the CD 4 -binding site of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope protein. In the transduced cells infected with HIV- 1, the nascent <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> bind intracellularly to the HIV- 1 envelope protein and inhibit HIV- 1 production. The secreted <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> are able to neutralize cell-free HIV- 1. In addition, the nascent <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> can inhibit HIV- 1 production by binding intracellularly to envelope mutants that escape neutralization by extracellular F 105 antibody. The combined intra- and extracellular binding activities of the expressed <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> result in the efficient blocking of cytopathic syncytium formation and infectious virus production. Thus, these antibody-producing T lymphocytes are not only resistant to HIV- 1 infection but also can protect surrounding lymphocytes by secreting neutralizing antibodies. This novel strategy of combining intracellular and extracellular immunization may be useful for gene therapy of AIDS and other diseases...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of whether}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} resides within a relatively impermeable membrane-bound vacuole or is free within the cytoplasm within its host cell {{is central to}} an understanding of the immunobiology of this intracellular parasite but is a matter of controversy. To explore this issue, we assessed the accessibility of medium-size protein molecules (<b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> of 50, 000 Da) to M. tuberculosis within human macrophages. We infected the macrophages with wild-type or green fluorescent protein-expressing M. tuberculosis, microinjected <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> directed against a major surface antigen of M. tuberculosis into the host cell, and assayed the accessibility of the bacteria to the <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> by both immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy. Whereas microinjected intact immunoglobulin G molecules against cytoplasmic early endosomal antigen 1 readily stained this antigen, microinjected <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> against M. tuberculosis did not stain the bacterium within its phagosome. In contrast, microinjected <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> against Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterium known to permeabilize its phagosomal membrane, strongly stained this bacterium.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether ouabain-like compound (OLC) exerts modulatory {{influences on the}} activity of vasomotor neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), we {{examined the effects of}} microinjecting ouabain, digoxin-specific antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments,</b> and mAb against ouabain on the rat RVLM. Microinjection of ouabain into the unilateral RVLM of anesthetized normotensive rats elicited dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). The pressor and sympathoexcitatory effects of ouabain in the RVLM were reversed by microinjections of an M 2 muscarinic antagonist, gallamine, or digoxin-specific antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments.</b> Furthermore, a prior microinjection in the RVLM of gallamine, digoxinspecific antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments,</b> or kainic acid or intravenous injection of hexamethonium all prevented the pressor and sympathoexcitatory effects induced by a subsequent microinjection of ouabain. Microinjections of either digoxinspecific antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> or gallamine per se significantly decreased baseline MAP and RSNA. Injection of digoxin-specific antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> attenuated the effects of a subsequent injection of gallamine. Microinjection of mAb against ouabain, but not nonspecific IgG, also significantly decreased baseline MAP and RSNA. These results suggest that OLC in the RVLM contributes to the tonic activity of vasomotor neurons in anesthetized normotensive rats, and the action of OLC in the RVLM is at least partly mediated by M 2 muscarinic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the roles of}} the extracellular domains of a gap junction protein and a cell adhesion molecule in gap junction and adherens junction formation by altering cell interactions with antibody <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments.</b> Using immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry we demonstrated that Novikoff cells contained the gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx 43), and the cell adhesion molecule, A-CAM (N-cadherin). Cells were dissociated in EDTA, allowed to recover, and reaggregated for 60 min in media containing <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> prepared from a number of antibodies.

Cell-cell dye transfer was detected within 30 s in cell pairs treated with control <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> (pre- immune serum, antibodies to the rat major histocompatibility complex or the amino or carboxyl termii of Cx 43).

Gap junctions were found on approximately 50 % of the cells in control samples using freeze-fracture EM. We demonstrated with reaggregated Novikoff cells that: (a) functional interactions of the extracellular domains of the connexins were necessary for the formation of gap junction channels; (b) cell interactions mediated by A-CAM were required for gap junction assembly; and (c) <b>Fab</b> <b>fragments</b> of antibodies for A-CAM or connexin extracellular domains blocked adherens junction formation...|$|R
