He was returned to his post after rest and recuperation in Naples. In an undated interview, he described being injured: [...] "Blood was running <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes...</b> I continued firing despite my wound." ...|$|E
500|$|Portal was {{singled out}} for praise by reviewers. Official Xbox Magazine admired its unique puzzle {{gameplay}} mechanics, stating {{that it was the}} first major advance in puzzle gaming [...] "since Russians started dropping blocks." [...] Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw, The Escapist's usually acerbically critical reviewer, stated in his Zero Punctuation review that he couldn't think of any criticism for Portal, which has [...] "some of the funniest pitch-black humor [...] ever heard in a game" [...] and concluded that it is [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish, and I will jam forks <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> if I ever use those words to describe anything else, ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to be surprised that she could sing in Russian. I was haunted {{for the rest of the}} day by the nightmare of the beggar's appearance and performance.|$|E
60|$|She nodded gravely. Then {{she leaned}} {{across the table and}} looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Notwithstanding her pallor and her black dress, I was forced to realize what I ever forbade my {{thoughts}} to dwell upon--her great and increasing beauty. She looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and my heart stood still.|$|E
60|$|She looked deep <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> for a moment, {{and then}} she turned away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drat {{the human}} imagination," [...] I answered, wiping away {{the blood that}} was {{trickling}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> from a thorn scratch. [...] "Let's look at your horse.

60|$|I {{was just}} passing {{the time of}} day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.|$|R
60|$|At {{that the}} tears forced {{themselves}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>eyes.</b> I turned away, and then I perceived {{for the first}} time the tall form of my old friend, Percy Singleton.|$|R

60|$|He faced about, and his Grace also, {{and both}} stared in wellbred surprise. As I live, Mr. Manners looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> very <b>eyes,</b> and gave {{no sign of}} recognition. And what between astonishment and anger, and a {{contempt}} that arose within me, I could not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saving your presence, master Harry, I'll be d----d if I {{believe any}} such thing.

Then, at sea, in a dark night, it is not so easy a matter to tell the difference. No, no, I am not tired of you yet, master Harry; and it is no trifle that shall part us." ...|$|R
60|$|He turned towards me, {{and looked}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> with two filmy orbs that {{distilled}} the rheum of intoxication.|$|E

60|$|I {{could see}} no more--my heart swelled <b>into</b> <b>my</b> throat--my <b>eyes</b> filled with tears; I felt as if I were acting a barbarous part in {{standing}} by and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish.

2500|$|A Cychrus rostratus once {{squirted}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> & gave me extreme pain; & I {{must tell}} you what happened to me {{on the banks of the}} Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred Panagæus crux major; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose Panagæus was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & Panagæus! ...|$|R
60|$|I was dumb still. He {{bent his}} head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

500|$|Cotto's next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|G. Thank you, Jack. It's a kind lie, but it's the blackest you've told {{for some}} time. I know what I'm doing, and I'm going <b>into</b> it with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> open. Old man, I can't help it. What {{would you do}} if you were in my place? ...|$|R
