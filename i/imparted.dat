5|$|Many of Weber's works famous {{today were}} collected, revised and {{published}} posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills.

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low <b>imparted</b> high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E

5|$|After peaking, Isidore {{entered a}} region of {{stronger}} upper-level winds and quickly weakened. By September8 it had deteriorated into a tropical storm, although re-intensification occurred after the shear decreased. An eye feature redeveloped {{in the center of}} the convection, and Isidore re-intensified into a hurricane on September 9. It ultimately reached a secondary peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h). Isidore's motion slowed, briefly becoming stationary, although it remained a hurricane for several days. Cooler waters <b>imparted</b> weakening to a tropical storm on September16, and the next day it became extratropical to the east of Newfoundland. There were a few ships that came in contact with Hurricane Isidore, one of which reported hurricane-force wind gusts. The storm never approached land during its duration, and no damage or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris.

5|$|From the age {{of about}} twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Greek and {{probably}} <b>imparted</b> a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school, and by October 1659, {{he was to be}} found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. Newton hated farming. Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Floyd was {{the only}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the United States in the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season. The final of seven tropical storms and three hurricanes, Floyd developed on October9 just off {{the east coast of}} Nicaragua. After becoming a tropical storm, it moved northward and crossed western Cuba. An approaching cold front caused Floyd to turn unexpectedly to the northeast, and late on October12 it attained hurricane status near the Florida Keys. It moved through southern Florida, spawning two tornadoes and leaving minor damage. The hurricane also produced rip tides that killed a person in southern Texas. Floyd maintained hurricane status for only 12hours before the cold front <b>imparted</b> hostile conditions and caused weakening. It passed through the Bahamas before becoming extratropical and later dissipating on October14.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Fabian was disorganized and had restricted outflow. An eastward moving upper-level trough <b>imparted</b> a northeast motion {{as well as}} unfavorable wind shear. Despite the atmospheric conditions, Fabian intensified slightly to peak winds of 45mph (75km/h), although the strongest winds were located primarily east of the center. Late on October15, the storm moved over the Isle of Youth before crossing over western Cuba. By early on October16, the center was becoming difficult to locate on satellite imagery. The storm moved through the Florida Straits, passing just southeast of the Florida mainland and into the Bahamas. There was initial uncertainty whether Fabian would be absorbed by the approaching trough or maintain its separate identity. By late on October16, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it was absorbed into the trough.|$|E

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is <b>imparted</b> by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|At peak intensity, Mitch {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction <b>imparted</b> weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucatán Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka has {{the largest}} number of schools, colleges and {{universities}} of any Bangladeshi city. The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 6), Junior (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of Primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of Junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination, and next two years of Secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) Examination. Education is mainly offered in Bengali, but English is also widely taught and used.
