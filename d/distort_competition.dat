Cartels are various forms of explicit and implied agreements among participants in economic competition which are capable of affecting the competition {{in a negative way}} and result not only into damaging other competitors, but also mostly into damaging the consumers. The main purpose of this thesis is to present a comprehensive view on the issues of agreements <b>distorting</b> economic <b>competition</b> from the point of the Czech and European substantive legal regulation and take into account some aspects of their practical assessment. Another purpose was to evaluate the alternatives of sanctioning of the prohibited agreements, both public enforcement and private enforcement of claims of the subjects that suffered loss resulting from the agreements. A partial purpose was to suggest possible future regulation of chosen areas. Chapter One is an introduction and includes delimitation of aims of the thesis. Chapter Two deals with the essence of the agreements and the concept itself. It also explains briefly, which particular impacts can these agreements practically have.

50|$|State aid was {{formally}} introduced into European Union statute law by the Treaty of Rome where it classified state aid as being any state intervention that distorted competition law. The definition was later updated by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in 2007. It stated that any aid {{given to a}} company by a state within the EU would generally be incompatible with the EU's Common Market. Within the new law under the treaty, {{the first chapter of}} it defines what is not allowed to be done with state aid and the second chapter defines actions that can be done within legal limits.1. Save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to <b>distort</b> <b>competition</b> by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.|$|E

50|$|The {{investigation}} was originally opened by the European Commissioner for Competition {{on behalf of}} the European Commission in June 2014. The Ireland case was opened in conjunction with two other similar cases; involving Starbucks (Netherlands) and Fiat (Luxembourg). The commissioner noted concerns that it believed discretion in transfer pricing rules had been used in the case of Apple to grant a selective advantage to the company. They believed that this violated Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 107(1) states that aid granted by member states cannot threaten to <b>distort</b> <b>competition.</b> In particular they are addressing the Irish tax rulings from 1991 and 2007 by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioner. Specifically, the Commission refers to taxable profit allocated to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI. The Commission claims the pricing arrangement between Apple and Ireland was not supported by an economic assessment and was in part supported by employment considerations.|$|E

In particular, the dissertation thesis deals with three of possible instruments used in the enforcement process of cartels, i. e. with dawn rides (unannounced on-the-spot inspections/investigations carried out in business and non-business premises), sanctions and sanction policies and with the leniency programs. These instruments are generally thought {{to be the most important}} and most effective tools in the enforcement process of cartels and necessary precondition of efficiency of competition law itself. In accordance with the topic, the dissertation thesis is divided into three parts. The first part is concerned with theoretical and normative definitions of agreements <b>distorting</b> <b>competition</b> and cartels. The main purpose of this part is to provide basic characteristics of these terms and to describe them in a way which will create a basement for explanation of the three legal instruments, which form the {{focal point of}} the thesis.
