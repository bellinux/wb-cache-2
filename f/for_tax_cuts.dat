25|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{was also a}} lot worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> {{in the run-up to the}} election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.|$|E

To reflect these changes, the party's unofficial name was altered to [...] "The New Moderates" [...] (...) in order to emphasize the break with the past.

500|$|As {{negotiations}} went {{on during}} the legislative session, Dayton suggested compromise budget frameworks ultimately reducing his proposed budget to $35.8 billion, but insisted {{that he would go}} no further and that Republicans were not amenable enough to compromise. The legislature passed budget bills that balanced the budget with significant cuts to social and infrastructure services, rather than raising any taxes. They described their budget as a compromise with the DFL after the state's revenue forecast was revised upward, as it called for $34 billion in state spending increased from $32 billion. Dayton claimed that the impasse was the doing of [...] "extreme right-wing" [...] freshman Republican legislators whom he did not talk to, and that he had cordial relationships with Republican leaders. In a statement {{at the end of the}} session on May 23, Dayton said [...] "Here I am in the middle — and they haven't moved". Republicans, including Koch and other legislative leaders, consistently insisted they would not accept a budget of over $34 billion, citing polls suggesting public opinion was on their side. During the session, the Republican Party held a rally calling <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> at the State Capitol on May 7. Protesters supporting Dayton's tax increases and opposed to the Republicans, many from public employee unions, gathered at the capitol multiple times, including at the end of the session.|$|E

2500|$|Having been {{approved}} for the Candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He {{was reported to have}} missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays. In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority. The incumbent Conservative MP, Bill Cash, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of Stone, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to [...] "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going". He also said the Party [...] "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke, GCB, PC (4 December 1811 – 27 July 1892), British , was {{a pivotal}} but often {{forgotten}} figure who shaped British {{politics in the}} latter half of the 19th century. He held office under William Ewart Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1868 and 1873 and as Home Secretary between 1873 and 1874. Lowe is remembered for his work in education policy, his opposition to electoral reform and his contribution to modern UK company law. The Division of Lowe, a now abolished Australian electoral division located in Sydney, was named after him. [...] Gladstone appointed Lowe as Chancellor expecting him to hold down public spending. Public spending rose, and Gladstone pronounced Lowe [...] "wretchedly deficient"; most historians agree. Lowe repeatedly underestimated the revenue, enabling him to resist demands <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and to reduce the national debt instead. He insisted that the tax system be fair to all classes. By his own main criterion of fairness – that the balance between direct and indirect taxation remain unchanged – he succeeded. However historians do not believe this balance is a good measure of class incidence and was by that time thoroughly archaic.|$|E
2500|$|This assault forced Dr Hewson into {{a partial}} backdown, agreeing not to levy the GST on food. But this {{concession}} opened Hewson {{to charges of}} weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the arithmetic of the whole package, since the weakening of the GST reduced the scope <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the new package were famously demonstrated in the [...] "birthday cake interview", in which Hewson was unable {{to answer a question}} posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as {{a turning point in the}} election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: [...] "Well I answered the question honestly. The answer's actually right. That doesn't count...I should have told him (Mike Willesee) to get stuffed!". According to Channel 9's 20 to 1 episode Unscripted and Unplanned, the Birthday Cake Interview incident was the moment Hewson lost the election with the interview held 10 days before polling day. However, polls right up to election day supported a Coalition victory.|$|E
