A straightforward solu-tion is to compute a PageRank-like algorithm on a facet-related graph, but it is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) a <b>faceted</b> <b>order</b> is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet.

40|$|Abstract: Multimedia {{content is}} uploaded, tagged and {{recommended}} by users of collaborative {{systems such as}} YouTube and Flickr. These systems can be represented as tagged-graphs, where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the online computation of user-rankings associated {{to a set of}} tags, called a facet. A simple approach to faceted ranking is to apply an algorithm that calculates a measure of node centrality, say, PageRank, to a subgraph associated with the given facet. This solution, however, is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative solution: (i) first, a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) then, a <b>faceted</b> <b>order</b> is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on empirical observations, we show that step (i) is scalable.

Thus, understanding the factors affecting the accuracy of these ratings is important to organizations and employees. Leniency, one rater error, is a tendency to assign higher ratings in appraisal than is warranted by actual performance. The proposed study examined how personality factors Agreeableness and Conscientiousness relate to rater leniency. The ability of narrower facets of personality to account for more variance in rater leniency than will the broad factors was also examined. The study used undergraduates' (n = 226) evaluations of instructor performance to test the study's hypotheses. In addition to personality variables, students' social desirability tendency and attitudes toward instructor were predicted to be related to rater leniency. Partial support for the study's hypotheses were found. The Agreeableness factor and three of the corresponding facets (Trust, Altruism and Tender-Mindedness) were positively related to rater leniency as predicted. The hypotheses that the Conscientiousness factor and three of the corresponding <b>facets</b> (<b>Order,</b> Dutifulness, and Deliberation) would be negatively related to rater leniency were not supported. In the current sample the single narrow facet Altruism accounted for more variance in rater leniency than the broad Agreeableness factor.

Various methods have been proposed to increase the efficiency, including doping with gold to increase the photocatalytic activity and doping with nitrogen or boron to extend the useable wavelengths into the visible range.

More recently, research has focussed upon alternative pathways through which conscientiousness may convey its desirable effects.

Behavioural intention was explored as a mediator of the conscientiousness–fruit and vegetable consumption relationship, with results indicating that behavioural intention fully mediated the relationship. Conscientiousness was also shown to predict health behaviour guideline adherence, when health behaviours were examined independently and simultaneously (study 2). Findings indicated greater levels of adherence in individuals high in conscientiousness.

Meanwhile, the items employed to measure the facet of responsibility require revision. Study 3 assessed psychological and physiological reactivity in response to stress in individuals with different levels of conscientiousness. Differential effects were seen between the conscientiousness groups, and primary appraisals were identified as being important for dealing with anticipated stress physiologically. Daily diaries and multi-level modelling were employed to assess the effects of daily hassles on unhealthy between-meal snacking in individuals high and low in conscientiousness (study 4). An implementation intention based intervention was also delivered, and experimental condition and conscientiousness were assessed as moderators of the daily hassle–unhealthy snacking association. Conscientiousness was shown to moderate the relationship with a greater association seen between daily hassles and unhealthy snacking in individuals low in conscientiousness. Condition also moderated this relationship, with individuals assigned to the active control condition consuming fewer unhealthy snacks on more stressful days.
