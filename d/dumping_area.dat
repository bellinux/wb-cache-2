Funded by the international cooperation project Novel Indicator Technologies for Minesite Rehabilitation and sustainable development, a hierarchical object oriented land cover classification is produced in this study. The ample spectral information, textural information, structure and shape information of high resolution SPOT 5 imagery are used synthetically in this method. There are two steps in object oriented information extraction: image segmentation and classification. First, the image is segmented using chessboard segmentation and multi-resolution segmentation method. Second, NDVI is used to distinguish vegetation and non-vegetation; vegetation is classified as high density vegetation, middling density vegetation and low density vegetation using spectral information, object oriented image texture analysis; non-vegetation is classified as vacant land and main road using length/width. Accuracy assessment indicate that this hierarchical method can be used to do land cover classification in waste <b>dump</b> <b>area,</b> the total accuracy increases to 86. 53 %, and Kappa coefficient increases to 0. 7907.

50|$|Subsequent {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} Payant {{had been killed}} by inmate Lemuel Smith, a rapist and two-time convicted murderer who was already serving two life sentences. She was lured to the prison chaplain's office by the perpetrator posing as another corrections employee. Smith was working in the chaplain's office at the time. The autopsy showed that Payant died by strangulation. Prior to the autopsy, there was speculation on whether or not Payant had been sexually assaulted due to her body being severely crushed by a sanitation compactor. After killing her, the inmate wrapped her body in plastic, stuffed it into a 55-gallon drum and disposed of it in a dumpster. When she came up missing, the prison was locked down and searched. No trace was found, but search dogs traced her scent to the <b>dumping</b> <b>area.</b> The next morning the landfill was searched and her body was found. Prior to those two murder convictions, Smith had also been the only suspect in at least two other killings, but prosecutors had declined to try him due to the 50-year sentence he was already facing. They reasoned that he would never leave prison anyway, so the indictments were dismissed. For having killed Officer Payant, Smith received a third murder conviction, and was originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted as unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|It {{was in the}} mid-1940s that Rev. Brown and a {{few others}} started to hold worship {{services}} from house to house. They most often met in a 2-story house on Henry Avenue across from Moseley’s Store. Rev. Brown and Rev. Moseley managed to secure a plat of land on the corner of 12th Street, NW and Rosser Avenue. In 1947, it was there that Rev. Brown constructed Holy Temple Church of God in Christ, his first major non-residential building. Soon after building the church, Brown met E. R. Martin. After doing a number of jobs for Martin who owned a lot of property, a deal was struck that made Brown the owner of several acres of land on 12th Street, NW. It was there that he built what would become the “family home.” The land had been a <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> on a dead end street. However, the location was ideally suited for Brown and his family that had swelled to 5 daughters and 5 sons. Brown seemingly could not get away from farming. He maintained huge gardens and several pigs until the late 1950s. The vegetables from the gardens were shared with church members and neighbors alike. Brown eventually built and sold 4 more houses on the same block. Most of the houses were constructed of cinder block with 2 front dormers for less than $10,000. In 2006, some 45-50 years later, the average market price was $190,000.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impacts of waste dumping on {{inorganic}} nutrients in the <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> of the Yellow Sea, {{and the effect of}} an governmental regulation of pollution in dumping areas. The environmental variables and parameters of the dumping and reference areas in the Yellow Sea were measured during July 2009 and analyzed. In addition, the analyzed data for inorganic nutrients over the last 10 years were obtained from the Korea Coast Guard (KCG) and the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI). The chemical environment of the study area revealed increases in concentrations of inorganic nutrients, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) in the bottom layer. On the contrary, the pH level was decreased. Most notably, the time series data of inorganic nutrients showed gradual increase over time in the <b>dumping</b> <b>area,</b> and thus, the oligotrophic waters trend toward eutrophic waters. The increases appears to be due to the disposal of large amounts of organic waste. In recent times, the wastes disposed at the area were largely comprised of livestock wastewater, and food processing waste water. The liquefied waste, which contains an abundance of nutrients, causes a sharp increase in concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in the <b>dumping</b> <b>area.</b> On the one hand, the dumpin...|$|E
