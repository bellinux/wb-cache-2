5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new <b>hot</b> <b>zone,</b> Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original <b>hot</b> <b>zone</b> but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

25|$|A filovirus, {{at first}} {{suspected}} to be Ebola virus (EBOV), was discovered among crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) within the Covance Primate Quarantine Unit in 1989. This attracted significant media attention, including {{the publication of}} The <b>Hot</b> <b>Zone.</b> The filovirus {{was found to be}} distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for humans. It was named after the community, and is now known as Reston virus (RESTV). Macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized, and the facility was sterilized. The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenue. It was eventually torn down, and a daycare was built in its place.|$|E
25|$|An alpha Stirling {{contains}} two power pistons in separate cylinders, one hot and one cold. The hot cylinder is situated inside the high temperature heat exchanger {{and the cold}} cylinder is situated inside the low temperature heat exchanger. This type of engine has a high power-to-volume ratio but has technical problems because of the usually high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seals. In practice, this piston usually carries a large insulating head to move the seals away from the <b>hot</b> <b>zone</b> {{at the expense of}} some additional dead space. The crank angle has a major effect on efficiency and the best angle frequently has to be found experimentally. An angle of 90° frequently locks.|$|E
500|$|Charlie {{develops}} the model {{needed to find}} the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's (Navi Rawat) assistance. Charlie's model yields {{what he calls a}} [...] "hot zone", an area in which the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the <b>hot</b> <b>zone</b> to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original <b>hot</b> <b>zone.</b> DNA, however, clears everyone in the original <b>hot</b> <b>zone.</b> As a result, Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) Walter Merrick (Anthony Heald) pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation [...] "less elegant" [...] and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work.|$|E

Following the Disney recording they were scheduled to perform a series of concerts at high-schools across America; in early April 2000 they had to cancel their performance at a high-school in Arlington Heights, Illinois, as they were obligated to return to Norway to meet high-schooling commitments. In June 2000, M2M were named [...] "Discovery of the Year" [...] by the Singapore Radio Association. In September that year, they toured the United States with Hanson, performing as the bands' opening act. Despite having sold over 1 million copies of Shades of Purple and over 1.5 million singles by September 2000, M2M were still considered a risk by their investors, who at that time were only coming close to recuperating the down payment they had made to promote the duo. In early 2001 they were featured in Atlantic Records' [...] "Teensation" [...] TV concerts, which were designed to promote [...] "rising stars".

40|$|Transversal <b>hot</b> <b>zones</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} to form in packed-bed reactors Used to conduct exothermic reactions. Packed bed reactors are usually operated under non adiabatic conditions. Previous attempts to predict the formation of transversal <b>hot</b> <b>zones</b> have been made on both shallow and long reactors under adiabatic conditions; that is, wall heat transport is zero. We show that a rich variety of slowly oscillating transversal <b>hot</b> <b>zones,</b> such as rotating patterns, targets, and spirals, may form in shallow, non adiabatic reactors. Under certain conditions, azimuthally symmetric target patterns coexist with azimuthally non symmetric rotating patterns. Surprisingly, a small wall heat transport can force a traveling wave or band motion observed pricier adiabatic conditions into a rotating pattern. A transition from the rotating patterns and/or target patterns to spiral waves depends on the residence time, the reactor length scale, and the wall heat transfer coefficient. A shallow reactor model predicts that the spatiotemporal patterns oscillate at 4 very low frequency (order of 10 (- 5) Hz), which is in agreement with predictions based on laboratory experiments...|$|R

The tape was released by the police on March 26, 2004, and Chen was found drowned in a harbor on March 28. The connection between Chen and the weapon maker was established by confirming Chen as being the 5th hand of a possible weapon; additionally family members of Chen stated that he left suicide notes, which according to the Taiwanese police's interpretation hinted that he committed the crime, although the notes had been burned by the family, and the interpretation held by the police is at best tenuous. Additionally the family members were reported to have recalled strange behavior of Chen following the 3–19 shooting. On the other hand, Huang also committed suicide with a gun that was made from the same manufacturer as that of the incident, and the bullet found shared traits with the one that hit the Vice-President.|$|E

2500|$|In situ {{ellipsometry}} {{refers to}} dynamic measurements during the modification process of a sample. This {{process can be}} used to study, for instance, the growth of a thin film, including calcium phosphate mineralization at the air-liquid interface, etching or cleaning of a sample. By in situ ellipsometry measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, [...] variation of optical properties with time. In situ ellipsometry measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the process chamber. Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the ellipsometry setup must be separated from the <b>hot</b> <b>zone.</b> In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has {{to be taken into account}} or minimized. Furthermore, the samples can be at elevated temperatures, which implies different optical properties compared to samples at room temperature. Despite all these problems, in situ ellipsometry becomes more and more important as process control technique for [...] thin film deposition and modification tools. In situ ellipsometers can be of single-wavelength or spectroscopic type. Spectroscopic in situ ellipsometers use multichannel detectors, for instance CCD detectors, which measure the ellipsometric parameters for all wavelengths in the studied spectral range simultaneously.|$|E
