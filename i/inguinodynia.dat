50|$|Chronic groin pain is {{potentially}} disabling with neuralgia, parasthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia. Patients {{may be unable}} to work, have limited physical & social activities, sleep disturbances, and psychologic distress. The management of <b>inguinodynia</b> is a difficult problem for many surgeons and 5-7% of patients experiencing post-hernia repair groin pain litigate.|$|E
50|$|Post herniorrhaphy pain syndrome, or <b>inguinodynia</b> is pain or {{discomfort}} lasting {{greater than}} 3 months after surgery of inguinal hernia. Randomized trials of laparoscopic vs open inguinal hernia repair have demonstrated similar recurrence rates {{with the use}} of mesh and have identified that chronic groin pain (>10%) surpasses recurrence (<2%) and is an important measure of success.|$|E
50|$|Use of mesh-based repair vs. suture-based repair {{has also}} been discussed. Some results suggest less <b>inguinodynia</b> after Shouldice (suture) than Lichtenstein (open mesh) for young men. Other studies find equal results between Shouldice and laparoscopic TEP. It must be {{recalled}} {{that the experience of}} the surgeon critically impacts the results, especially for Shouldice and laparoscopic repairs, which are fairly technical operations.|$|E
50|$|If {{operative}} repair is chosen, mesh excision +/- triple neurectomy may {{be considered}} with small studies suggesting good outcomes. The largest series encompassing 415 patient, most following open or suture repair, demonstrates significant improvement following triple neurectomy. However, standard triple neurectomy does not address <b>inguinodynia</b> secondary to neuropathy of the genitofemoral nerve and the preperitoneal segment of its genital branch. But extension of the standard triple neurectomy to include the genitofemoral nerve has given good results, on a small series of 16 patients.|$|E
5000|$|As the hernia progresses, {{contents}} of the abdominal cavity, such as the intestines, liver, can descend into the hernia and {{run the risk of}} being pinched within the hernia, causing an intestinal obstruction. If the blood supply of the portion of the intestine caught in the hernia is compromised, the hernia is deemed [...] "strangulated" [...] and gut ischemia and gangrene can result, with potentially fatal consequences. The timing of complications is not predictable. Emergency surgery for incarceration and strangulation carry much higher risk than planned, [...] "elective" [...] procedures. However, the risk of incarceration is low, evaluated at 0.2% per year. On the other hand, surgical intervention has a significant risk of causing <b>inguinodynia,</b> and this is why minimally symptomatic patients are advised to watchful waiting.|$|E
5000|$|A {{larger and}} more recent study which was a followup at 5 years of 1370 from a {{randomized}} study of TEP vs. open repair demonstrated lower pain rates in the laparoscopic group (10% vs. 20%). <b>Inguinodynia</b> symptoms decreased over time, even in those in the moderate to severe pain group. In addition, when an inguinal pain questionnaire was administered to these individuals at a median followup of 9.4 years, physical ability was affected more in the open repair group. Predictors of chronic pain in the TEP group included Body Mass Index ≤ 3rd quartile (OR: 3.04), difference in preop and postop physical testing (OR: 2.14) and time to full recovery exceeding the median (OR: 2.09). In the open group, the only association was noted with postoperative pain score exceeding the third quartile (OR: 1.89 [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Biomeshes are {{increasingly}} popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction {{on the market}} in 2003. Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine. Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes, they are absorbable, and can be used for repair in an infected environment, such as an incarcerated hernia. Moreover, they seem to improve comfort and presumably, they reduce the risk of inguinodynia.They have been tested after mesh-related <b>inguinodynia.</b> Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes, the cheapest ($500) being Surgisis-Biodesign, manufactured by Cook Group, made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa. Currently, there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh, Tigr Matrix, manufactured by Novus Scientific, on the US market (510(k) Food and Drug Administration clearance) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011. It only has one 3-year pre-clinical evidence on sheep.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective : to {{evaluate}} the incidence of chronic pain {{and its impact on}} the quality of life of patients submitted to inguinal hernioplasty using the Lichtenstein technique. Methods : this was a descriptive, cross-sectional study of patients operated under spinal anesthesia from February 2013 to February 2015 and who had already completed six postoperative months. We questioned patients about the presence of chronic inguinal pain and, if confirmed, invited them to a consultation in which we assessed the pain and its impact on quality of life. Results : out of 158 patients submitted to the procedure, we identified 7. 6 % as having <b>inguinodynia.</b> Of these, there was an impact on the quality of life in 25 %. Conclusion : the incidence of <b>inguinodynia</b> after hernioplasty with repercussion in quality of life was similar to the one of found in the world literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic <b>inguinodynia</b> (groin pain) is {{a common}} {{complication}} following open inguinal hernia repair or a Pfannenstiel incision but may also be experienced after other types of (groin) surgery. If conservative treatments are to no avail, tailored remedial surgery, including a neurectomy and/or a (partial) meshectomy, may be considered. Retrospective studies in patients with chronic <b>inguinodynia</b> suggested that spinal anaesthesia is superior compared to general anaesthesia in terms of pain relief following remedial operations. This randomised controlled trial is designed to study the effect of type of anaesthesia (spinal or general) on pain relief following remedial surgery for <b>inguinodynia.</b> Methods A total of 190 adult {{patients who suffer from}} unacceptable chronic (more than 3 months) <b>inguinodynia,</b> as subjectively judged by the patients themselves, are included. Only patients scheduled to undergo a neurectomy and/or a meshectomy by an open approach are considered for inclusion and randomised to spinal or general anaesthesia. Patients are excluded if pain is attributable to abdominal causes or if any contraindications for either type of anaesthesia are present. Primary outcome is effect of type of anaesthesia on pain relief. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, quality of life, use of analgesics and (in) direct medical costs. Patient follow-up period is one year. Discussion The first patient was included in January 2016. The expected trial deadline is December 2019. Potential effects are deemed related to the entire setting of type of anaesthesia. Since any setting is multifactorial, all of these factors may influence the outcome measures. This is the first large randomised controlled trial comparing the two most frequently used anaesthetic techniques in remedial surgery for groin pain. There is a definite need for evidence-based strategies to optimise results of these 0 types of surgery. Besides pain relief, other important patient-related outcome measures are assessed to include patient 2 ̆ 019 s perspectives on outcome.

40|$|Background: Neuropathic <b>inguinodynia</b> {{following}} {{inguinal hernia}} repair sometimes becomes a disabling disease. We report {{a case of}} successful surgical treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic pain after inguinal hernia by laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. Case presentation: A seventy-year-old male who underwent right-side inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein method revisited our hospital with <b>inguinodynia</b> 16 months after surgery. After a thorough assessment, the patient was diagnosed with neuropathic pain based on the following: 1) dermatomal mapping suggested ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve problems, 2) pain was evoked by specific movement, 3) the site of maximum pain was slightly changed at every physical examination, and 4) no evidence of recurrence or meshoma was observed on MRI. Conservative therapies were ineffective. Surgical intervention using laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy was performed 4 months after treatment initiation. In the lateral recumbent position, a three-port method was used. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves were identified and resected. Although a residual nerve emerged from L 2 / 3 toward the inguinal region, the nerve remained in situ. Pain assessment 3  h after surgery revealed that pain was decreased but remained. Reoperation involving resection of the residual nerve {{was performed on the}} same day. Although another type of mild pain appeared 3 months after surgery, the patient resumed normal life, without any restrictions. Conclusions: Laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy is useful for treating refractory neuropathic pain. The diagnosis of neuropathic pain via thorough preoperative assessment is vital for procedure success because the procedure would not be effective for other types of pain...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inguinodynia</b> (chronic groin pain) {{is one of}} the {{recognised}} {{complications of}} the commonly performed Lichtenstein mesh inguinal hernia repair. This has major impact on quality of life in a significant proportion of patients. The pain is classified as neuropathic and non-neuropathic related to nerve damage and to the mesh, respectively. Correct diagnosis of this problem is relatively difficult. A thorough history and clinical examination are essential, as is a good knowledge of the groin nerve distribution. In spite of the common nature of the problem, the literature evidence is limited. In this paper we discuss the diagnostic tools and treatment options, both non-surgical and surgical. In addition, we discuss the criteria for surgical intervention and its optimal timing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic groin pain is a {{major cause}} of {{post-operative}} morbidity in open inguinal mesh hernia repair. Neu- rectomy is a well-established treatment modality. This study was performed to evaluate the neurosensory outcomes of prophylactic neurectomy in open mesh hernia repair. Aim: To assess the incidence of <b>inguinodynia</b> in patients undergoing open mesh hernia repair And to study, the neurosen- sory outcomes of sacrificing the ilioinguinal nerve in comparison to the group in which a nerve is identified and preserved. Materials and methods: A prospective double-blinded study was performed at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal from September 2008 to December 2009. The ilioinguinal nerve was either preserved or sacrificed according to the surgeon's choosing. Pain and hyposthesia were studied at defined timed intervals by a single observer. Results: 105 inguinal hernia mesh repairs were enrolled into the study. Nerve excision was done in 44 patients and pre- served in 61 patients. Ninety patients were followed till six months. At post-operative day 1, all patients in both the groups had pain and 15. 2 % had numbness. Chronic post surgical <b>inguinodynia</b> was seen in 16. 7 % of the population in the study group and numbness in 5. 6 % of the study population at six months. Conclusion: The severity of pain in the neurectomy group was less than the control group. There were no significant dif- ferences in the neurosensory outcomes of prophylactic ilioinguinal neurectomies in open mesh hernia repair compared to nerve preservation and hence prophylactic neurectomy is presently the choice of most surgeons.

40|$|L. A. Danto, in a {{communication}} published in this journal, 1 denounced the potential danger {{of all those}} surgical strategies meant to prevent the chronic <b>inguinodynia</b> arising after an inguinal hernia repair {{with the use of}} a prosthetic mesh, and the almost complete abandon of the traditional inguinal hernioplasty. As reported in many series, the incidence of postoperative <b>inguinodynia</b> is not the only increased complication after mesh hernioplasty. The nature and properties of the prosthetic material pose in fact a high risk of complications as protrusion, extrusion, infection and intestinal fistulization, and most importantly, once in place, is rigid, passive, adynamic, and aphysiological. In turn, this increase in complications seems not to have been counterbalanced by a long-lasting decrease in the recurrence rate. 2 Assumed as standard of care, the mesh placement distorted the fundamental principles of surgery, and shifted inguinal hernia from a disease itself to a risk factor. Surgery of inguinal hernia is in fact becoming surgery of prevention of complications from mesh placement, forgetting that the mesh itself is the main complication of the hernia surgery. Surgery remains an art technically based on 4 principles: what is united is separated (dieresis); what is separated is united (synthesis); what is exceeding is removed (exeresis); and what is missed is added (prosthesis). The use of prosthetic materials has thus its main indication in case of lack of tissue to prevent recurrence. Bassini, following these basic principles, showed that in most patients this lack of tissue is only apparent, and that surgery of hernia is a surgery of synthesis and not of prosthesis. He showed that the mobilization and the use of the musculoaponeurotic triple layer for the repair is sufficient and effective. 3, 4 His astonishing results (2...|$|E

With the success of modern hernia repair techniques, recurrence rates have significantly declined, with a lower incidence than the development of chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain (CPIP). The avoidance of CPIP is arguably the most important clinical outcome and has the greatest impact on patient satisfaction, health care utilization, societal cost, and quality of life. The etiology of CPIP is multifactorial, with overlapping neuropathic and nociceptive components contributing to this complex syndrome. Treatment is often challenging, and no definitive treatment algorithm exists. Multidisciplinary management of this complex problem improves outcomes, as treatment must be individualized. Current medical, pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical management strategies are reviewed. Keywords: <b>inguinodynia,</b> chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain, inguinal herni...|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is a well-debated {{approach}} to inguinal hernia repair. Multiple technical and outcome variables have been {{compared with those}} of traditional open inguinal hernia repairs. One of these variables is the choice of anesthesia. To date, no reports describe the use of spinal anesthesia for laparoscopic hernia repairs. We present herein a review of our experience with spinal anesthesia for the total extraperitoneal preperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair (TEP). Methods: We prospectively reviewed 30 patients undergoing TEP while under spinal anesthesia. Methods of anesthesia, surgical procedure, operative and anesthesia delivery times, as well as outcomes were reviewed. Patients were followed up over a 2 -year period. Short- and long-term results of the surgical procedure and anesthesia delivered were noted. Results: All patients underwent successful laparoscopic hernia repair while under spinal anesthesia without conversion to general anesthesia. Forty-four hernias were repaired in 30 patients. Short- and long-term follow-up (2 years) revealed no significant untoward affects from the spinal anesthesia in this series of patients. Aside from <b>inguinodynia</b> in 3 patients in the short-term, no other short-term or long-term untoward sequelae occurred. Conclusions: Spinal anesthesia is a feasible, and in our experience, the preferable method of anesthesia for total extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{femoral hernia}} is a rare, {{acquired}} condition, {{which has been}} reported in less than 5 % of all abdominal wall hernias, with a female to male ratio of 4 : 1. Presentation of caseWe report a case in a female patient who had a previous open inguinal herniorrhaphy three years previously. She presented with right sided groin pain of one month duration. Ultrasound gave a differential diagnosis of a recurrent inguinal hernia or a femoral hernia. A transabdominal preperitoneal repair was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. DiscussionLaparoscopic repair of a femoral hernia {{is still in its infancy}} and even though the outcomes are superior to an open repair, open surgery remains the standard of care. The decision to perform a laparoscopic trans abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair was facilitated by the patient having previous open hernia surgery. The learning curve for laparoscopic femoral hernia repair is steep and requires great commitment from the surgeon. Once the learning curve has been breached this is a feasible method of surgical repair. This is demonstrated by the fact that this case report is from a rural hospital in Canada. ConclusionLaparoscopic femoral hernia repair involves more time and specialized laparoscopic skills. The advantages are a lower recurrence rate and lower incidence of <b>inguinodynia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chronic Groin Pain (<b>Inguinodynia)</b> {{following}} {{inguinal hernia}} repair is a significant, though under-reported problem. Mild pain lasting {{for a few}} days is common following mesh inguinal hernia repair. However, moderate to severe pain persisting more than 3 mo after inguinal herniorrhaphy should be considered as pathological. The major reasons for chronic groin pain have been identified as neuropathic cause due to inguinal nerve(s) damage or non-neuropathic cause due to mesh or other related factors. The symptom complex of chronic groin pain varies from a dull ache to sharp shooting pain along the distribution of inguinal nerves. Thorough history and meticulous clinical examination should be performed to identify the exact cause of chronic groin pain, as there is no single test to confirm the aetiology behind the pain or to point out the exact nerve involved. Various studies have been performed to look at the difference in chronic groin pain rates with the use of mesh vs non-mesh repair, use of heavyweight vs lightweight mesh and mesh fixation with sutures vs glue. Though there is no convincing evidence favouring one over the other, lightweight meshes are generally preferred because of their lesser foreign body reaction and better tolerance by the patients. Identification of all three nerves {{has been shown to be}} an important factor in reducing chronic groin pain, though there are no well conducted randomised studies to recommend the benefits of nerve excision vs preservation. Both non-surgical and surgical options have been tried for chronic groin pain, with their consequent risks of analgesic side-effects, recurrent pain, recurrent hernia and significant sensory loss. By far the best treatment for chronic groin pain is to avoid bestowing this on the patient by careful intra-operative handling of inguinal structures and better patient counselling pre- and post-herniorraphy...|$|E
