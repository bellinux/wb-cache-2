40|$|In this paper, a {{simultaneous}} {{analysis of the}} elastic scattering data of the 16 O+ 16 O system for the energy range 5 { 10 MeV/nucleon is performed theoretically {{within the framework of}} the optical model formalism, by using the { <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster po-tential. The { <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potential is evaluated by using the -cluster dis-tribution densities in the usual nucleon{nucleon <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> process with an eective { interaction potential. The results of the { <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potential analy-sis are compared with the ndings of the phenomenological Woods{Saxon squared and nucleon{nucleon <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> potentials. All potentials have exhibited a very good agreement with the experimental measurements for the elastic scattering angular dis-tributions. Furthermore, it is shown that, the { <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potential and nucleon{nucleon <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> potential calculations provide very consistent results with each other. Thus, the 16 O+ 16 O system has been described by optical potentials having a deep real potential part and a weak absorptive imaginary potential part...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{scattering}} {{cross sections}} for the halo nucleus 11 Be incident on 64 Zn in vicinity of Coulomb barrier are calculated using the microscopic <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> model. The parametrized densities {{taking into account}} for the halo part are folded with the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction (M 3 Y) to yield the microscopic <b>double</b> <b>folded</b> potential. The dynamic polarization potential has been computed using the dipole strength distribution from the cluster model and from experiments.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{simultaneous}} {{analysis of the}} elastic scattering and fusion cross-section data of the ^ 12 C+^ 24 Mg system around the Coulomb barrier and over energies by using the microscopic α-α <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potential {{within the framework of}} the optical model and the coupled-channels formalism. The α-α <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potential is obtained by using the α-cluster distribution densities of the nuclei in the usual <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> procedure. The microscopic potential results are compared with the findings of the phenomenological deep and shallow potentials. It is subsequently shown that only phenomenological deep real, microscopic nucleon-nucleon and α-α <b>double</b> <b>folding</b> cluster potentials provide a consistent description of the angular distributions and fusion cross-section data simultaneously. The effect of the inclusion of the excited states of the target nucleus ^ 24 Mg on the fusion cross-section predictions is also determined by the coupled-channels calculations, which are shown to improve the agreement.
