40|$|This paper studies {{externalities}} of nationally determined cost-sharing systems, {{in particular}} coinsurance rates (patients pay {{a percentage of}} the price), under pharmaceutical parallel trade in a two-country model with a vertical distributor relationship. Parallel trade generates a price-decreasing competition <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destination country and a price-increasing double marginalization <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> source country. An increase of <b>the</b> coinsurance rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destination country of the parallel import mitigates <b>the</b> double marginalization <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> source country. An increase of <b>the</b> coinsurance rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> source country reinforces <b>the</b> competition <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destination country.

40|$|International audienceThe {{survival}} of Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311) heated and recovered in media with 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, 4 % or 5 % added sodium chloride was investigated. A protective <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heating medium and an inhibitory <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recovery medium were observed. The results showed {{an interaction between}} the effect, on D 58 values, of sodium chloride concentration in both media. Lower concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heating media led to a greater effect of the sodium chloride concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recovery media. When the sodium chloride concentration was <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> both media, <b>the</b> protective <b>effect</b> exerted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heating media prevailed over its inhibitory <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recovery media...|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years that followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from {{his first year in}} Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E

30|$|We {{examined}} {{the presence of}} the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> datasets. The ARCH effect represents the presence of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> datasets. The results of <b>the</b> ARCH <b>effect,</b> reported <b>in</b> Table  1, show the presence of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> datasets of the stock index and oil price.

5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} in western Cuba, causing flash flooding and severe damage. The storm damaged 8,745houses and destroyed 154buildings, leaving hundreds homeless. Heavy rainfall {{continued in the}} country for several weeks after the storm, and damage from Alberto totaled about $85million (1982USD, $ USD). At least 23people were killed in the country. Initially, Alberto was forecast to continue northeastward and strike Florida, though it turned and rapidly weakened, resulting in minor <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E

Due to a request by France in the 2003 WMO Meeting, the name Frances was to be removed from the rotating cyclone lists after the 2004 hurricane season, even if Frances wasn't as destructive, but the destruction caused by Frances in the United States was enough to warrant retirement on its own merit.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term. Death rates {{from a variety}} of causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were taken along threatened areas of coastal Florida (mainly the Tampa Bay Area), including the evacuation of thousands of residents. Damage was extensive in Cuba, and five people were killed there. The cyclone's <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States were minor to moderate, and the most significant impact was to citrus crops. No deaths occurred in the country, although high tides caused some flooding of low-lying terrain. The cyclone's structure was extensively observed and investigated.|$|E

Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E

No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while they were taking selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.|$|E
