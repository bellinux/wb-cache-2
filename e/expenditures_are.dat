25|$|Labelled drug-related <b>expenditures</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} the direct planned {{spending}} that reflects the voluntary engagement {{of the state in}} the field of illicit drugs. Direct public expenditures explicitly labeled as drug-related can be easily traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents such as national budgets and year-end reports. Unlabelled expenditure refers to unplanned spending and is estimated through modeling techniques, based on a top-down budgetary procedure. Starting from overall aggregated expenditures, this procedure estimates the proportion causally attributable to substance abuse (Unlabelled Drug-related Expenditure = Overall Expenditure × Attributable Proportion). For example, to estimate the prison drug-related expenditures in a given country, two elements would be necessary: the overall prison expenditures in the country for a given period, and the attributable proportion of inmates due to drug-related issues. The product of the two will give a rough estimate that can be compared across different countries.|$|E
25|$|Funding of the Crown's {{operation}} in the provinces is split between the federal and provincial governments. As the viceroy is a federal appointee, the federal Crown pays in two parts—In Capital City Expenses and Out of Capital City Expenses—for some of the lieutenant governors' costs of office; his or her salary, which, like the governor general's, is fully taxed; and, through the Department of Canadian Heritage, a superannuation to retired lieutenant governors, though this money is actually garnished off of the individual's salary during his or her time in office. The provincial coffers supply the relevant lieutenant governor for other expenses of office, travel costs, and the upkeep of official residences, amongst other necessities. However, there is no uniform way in which each province distributes the money, and the amounts will also vary, depending on the facilities available to the Queen's representative, how they are used, which departments support them, and how they <b>expenditures</b> <b>are</b> listed in the provincial estimates.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution of Canada {{gives the}} federal {{government}} exclusive responsibility for national defence, and <b>expenditures</b> <b>are</b> thus outlined in the federal budget. For the 2007–2010 fiscal year, the amount allocated for defence spending was C$6.15 billion which is 1.4 percent of the country's GDP. This regular funding was augmented in 2005 with an additional C$12.5 billion over five years, {{as well as a}} commitment to increasing regular force troop levels by 5,000 persons, and the primary reserve by 4,500 over the same period. In 2010, a further C$5.3 billion over five years was provided to allow for 13,000 more regular force members, and 10,000 more primary reserve personnel, as well as C$17.1 billion for the purchase of new trucks for the Canadian Army, transport aircraft and helicopters for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and joint support ships for the Royal Canadian Navy.

25|$|Combined {{water and}} sewer bills amount, on average, to less than 0.5% of total {{household}} expenditures and are thus quite affordable. The intermittent supply leads many to rely on bottled or tanked water, which is about 8 to 10 times higher than piped water, so that total household <b>expenditures</b> <b>are</b> often {{much higher than the}} utility bill. Prices paid to water vendors are 4 to 8 JD per m3. In 2007 it was estimated that an average poor household with 6 members in the Middle Governorates spends 31-39 JD per year on its {{water and sewer}} bill at a consumption of 70 liter/capita/day, corresponding to only 0.4% of household expenditures. However, if other items are added the picture changes substantially: it costs 35 JD per year to depreciate the cost of a 2 m3 rooftop storage tank over 10 years; 160 JD per year to buy 2 liters/capita/day of bottled water at a price of 0.04 JD per liter (0.80 JD per canister of 5 gallons); and 153 JD per year to buy the equivalent of 28 liters/capita/day at a price of 2.50 JD/m3 from water vendors. This amounts to 374 JD per year and household, corresponding to 6.3% of expenditures. In addition, for households not connected to the sewer network the cost of emptying septic tanks at a cost between 21 and 40 JD per load needs to be added to calculate total water and sanitation expenditures. In conclusion, the cost of the water bill thus is only a fraction of total water expenditures, and household water expenditures could be lowered significantly if a sufficient quantity of good quality water was supplied on a reliable basis.|$|E

500|$|The {{funding of}} {{political}} parties, independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated {{in comparison with}} developed western democracies.

Each election candidate (or slate) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election-campaign donations, other related funding, and all campaign-related expenditures. The maximum donation to a single party, candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated. In cases of individuals it is set at 30,000kuna ( [...] 4,050euro), regardless of purpose.
