40|$|Isocyanates {{are among}} the most {{frequent}} causes of occupational asthma in industrialized countries. Early diagnosis of <b>diisocyanate</b> <b>asthma</b> followed by prompt termination of chemical exposure can prevent chronic morbidity due to persistent asthma. Chronic exposure to isocyanates also induces hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). The accurate diagnosis of diisocynate asthma requires a systematic approach that combines information obtained from the occupational history, immunologic tests and physiologic studies. The prevention of health problems from toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 4, 4 ′-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and 1, 6 ′-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) is essential for all those handling the chemicals. Regulatory exposure limits should be observed. However, wheezing, coughing or even asthmatic attacks may occur after exposure much below the regulatory exposure limits especially in sensitive individuals. Preventing or minimizing exposure is of prime importance and should be supported by the installation of engineering controls, by education of the workforce, by regular monitoring of the workplace exposure and by medical surveillance. To prevent such asthma it is suggested that workers should be tested airway sensitivity and should avoid working in areas that have dust containing specific-IgE. Such tests must be periodically performed after working. Symptoms induced by isocyanate need earlier discover and early isolation of the associated individuals...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and aim Asthma {{is mainly}} {{characterized}} by reversible airflow limitation, non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Occupational asthma {{is the most}} common work-related lung disease in the industrial world. More than 200 biological and chemical products, used in industry, agriculture and the services, can cause asthma via immunologic or toxic mechanisms. Diisocyanates are commonly identified causes of occupational asthma. They are extensively used in industry, particularly in the automobile industry (foam rubber cushions, dashboards, car body parts, and for finish coatings). Airway inflammation, is a prominent characteristic of <b>diisocyanate</b> <b>asthma.</b> Both neutrophils and eosinophils were found in BAL fluid of patients with <b>diisocyanate</b> <b>asthma.</b> In the airways of diisocyanate asthmatic individuals, increased activated T lymphocytes (predominantly CD 4 + cells) have been found, as well as increased levels of cytokines produced by Th 2 cells (IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13). The main aim of this thesis was to develop a satisfactory mouse model for chemical-induced occupational asthma. To achieve this aim, the following objectives were pursued. 1. Verify whether a model, based on a protocol for assessing the risk of dermal sensitization, would allow identification of respiratory sensitizers (chapter 2). 2. Verify whether the most common features of asthma, i. e. reversible airway obstruction, non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation could be achieved in that model (chapter 3). 3. Verify the immunological mechanisms to improve our understanding of the developed model (chapter 4). A good identification of allergenic low molecular weight chemicals is of great importance for industry and occupational health. Main results Chapter 2 : Investigating the (respiratory) sensitizing capacity of PCT. Chapter 2 originated from an outbreak of occupational asthma in a plastic factory. The causal agent was found to be a piperidinyl chlorotriazine derivative (PCT), a novel UVstabilizer. PCT was found to be only slightly positive in the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) and the “mouse IgE test”, because only very high concentrations (10 and 20 %) yielded positive responses. This was not in agreement with experience in humans. We developed a mouse model, based on the LLNA; whereby sensitization was achieved by dermal treatment on the ears for three consecutive days (day 1, 2 and 3) and challenge was done by an intranasal challenge on day 10. On day 11 methacholine challenge was performed. This protocol allowed us to identify respiratory sensitizers such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and PCT, because only mice previously treated with these sensitizers exhibited increased ventilatory responsiveness to methacholine 24 h after an intranasal challenge. The serum level of total IgE was increased in mice treated with TDI, but not in those treated with PCT, indicating that besides total IgE, other factors {{play a critical role in}} hyperresponsiveness. Chapter 3 : Development of a murine model for chemically induced asthma. A refined protocol, using an additional dermal application on day 7, resulted in an asthma model that exhibited several features of human asthma. Mice dermally sensitized and intranasally challenged with TDI showed pronounced signs of airway obstruction immediately after intranasal challenge, signs of increased bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine 24 h later, as well as airway inflammation (neutrophils in the BAL fluid and a few eosinophils around the blood vessels). We found that the concentration (3 %, 1 % or 0. 3 % TDI) and frequency (day 1, 2 and 3 or day 1 alone) of the initial dermal sensitization are critical. When mice were sensitized with 3 % TDI for three consecutive days, the respiratory response was blunted, whereas it was enhanced in the “lightly” sensitized (either 0. 3 % TDI for three days, or 1 % TDI on a single day) animals. Chapter 4 : Starting to unravel the immunologic mechanisms underlying our model. At several time points after intranasal administration of TDI (1 h, 6 h and 24 h), BAL fluid was investigated for the presence of inflammatory cells and cytokines. The lymph nodes draining the ear (auricular) were removed 24 h after intranasal challenge to determine the lymphocyte sub-populations and secreting cytokine profile (Th 1 vs. Th 2). We confirmed that dermally treated mice showed an increased Penh after intranasal challenge with TDI. In BAL, from the responsive groups, an increase in total cell count, was found 6 h after the challenge, and the differential cell count showed an increase in neutrophils (10 - 30 %), which corresponds to increased levels of MIP- 2. Lymphocytes obtained from the auricular lymph nodes, which drain the ears, showed an increase in the proportion of B-cells and a secretion profile (after in vitro stimulation with Concanavaline A) indicative of both Th 1 – Th 2 (T helper type 1 and 2 cell), i. e. an increase of interleukin- 4 and an increase of interferon- g. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) mice that were sensitized, “boosted” and challenged with TDI did not show ventilatory changes, suggesting, that lymphocytes are necessary to induce the ventilatory changes. Conclusion We almost succeeded in creating a satisfactory model for chemical-induced asthma. Our findings point to a mixed Th 1 – Th 2 response, in contrast to high molecular weight compound allergens, which induce atopic asthma via the Th 2 pathway. Several questions remain to be answered, including the determination of relevant diisocyanate antigens and routes of exposure, better characterization of the inflammatory cells and mediators responsible for diisocyanate sensitization and asthma, and identification of the genetic factors that regulate airway inflammation. Until now, no mouse model perfectly replicates real-life human diisocyanate-induced disease in humans. Nevertheless, good models are important to protect workers from chemicals that can cause occupational asthma. nrpages: 132 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to diisocyanates is {{recognized}} as {{a leading cause of}} occupational asthma. Occupational asthma induced by isocyanates shares many characteristics with immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated asthma: in both, the responsible agent is known, and the clinical presentation, response to inhalation challenge in the laboratory, and response to antiasthma drugs are similar. Although asthma mediated by an IgE mechanism occurs in atopic subjects, occupational asthma induced by isocyanates occurs mostly in nonatopic asthmatics, and an IgE-mediated mechanism has not been consistently demonstrated. However, activated T lymphocytes, methacromatic cells, and eosinophils are increased in the bronchial mucosa of allergic and nonallergic asthmatics and subjects with occupational asthma induced by isocyanates, suggesting similar, probably immunologically mediated mechanisms for both nonoccupational and occupational asthma. Occupational asthma occurs in up to 5 - 10 % of the exposed subjects. Evaluation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes in exposed subjects who develop toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) <b>asthma</b> has shown a negative association with HLA-DQB 1 * 0501 and a positive association with HLA-DQB 1 * 0503 alleles. In addition, a high proportion of TDI asthmatics express the HLA-DQB 1 * 0503 -associated aspartic acid at residue 57, suggesting that HLA-DQ may have a key role in conferring susceptibility. Thus, asthma induced by the low-molecular-weight agent TDI may result from an immunologic reaction due to the interaction of genetic susceptibility with exposure in the workplace.

40|$|Toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) -induced <b>asthma</b> is a {{frequent}} occupational airway disease. To determine whether a calibrated dosage of oral slow-release theophylline inhibits asthmatic reactions and the associated increase of airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by TDI, we examined six asthmatic subjects who developed a late or a dual asthmatic reaction after TDI inhalation challenge. We administered oral slow-release theophylline or placebo to each subject for 7 days according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study design. When the subjects received a placebo, TDI caused a late or a dual asthmatic reaction. When the subjects received theophylline, TDI caused significantly reduced late asthmatic reactions. Mean serum theophylline concentrations were within the therapeutic range. Theophylline neither modified the baseline airway responsiveness to methacholine, nor the increase of airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by TDI. These results suggest that slow-release theophylline may improve TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions, {{but it does not}} change the baseline airway responsiveness to methacholine and the increase of airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by TDI...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the status of}} activation of lymphocytes {{and the role of}} cytokines on the inflammatory response of the bronchial mucosa in toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) <b>asthma,</b> we performed a quantitative analysis of bronchial biopsies obtained from 15 subjects with TDI-induced asthma and seven normal control subjects. Markers of activation of lymphocytes (CD 25 and Very Late activation Antigen- 1, VLA- 1) and expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) were determined by immunohistology in the submucosa. Moreover, expression of adhesion molecules on endothelium of submucosal vessels was assessed. Asthmatic subjects had increased numbers of cells expressing CD 25 and VLA- 1 compared with the control group (p < 0. 05). TNF alpha and IL- 1 beta immunoreactivity was increased in asthmatics compared with control subjects (p < 0. 01), whereas the expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM- 1 and E-selectin, on vascular endothelium was not significantly different. No significant differences in the morphologic quantifications were observed between the asthmatics who had biopsies taken 2 d after TDI challenge (n = 7) and those with longer interval (21 +/- 8 d) between TDI challenge and biopsy (n = 8), suggesting that the increase in CD 25, VLA- 1, TNF alpha, and IL- 1 beta was not due to an acute effect, but could be considered a part of the chronic inflammatory process of the airways. We conclude that the inflammatory response of the airways in TDI-induced asthma is characterized by persistent activation of lymphocytes and by chronic expression of proinflammatory cytokines...|$|R

No significant difference was found in the distribution of DRB 1 alleles between asthmatics and controls.

Male BALB/c mice were first dermally sensitized and then challenged with TDI by means of compressed air nebulization. The mice were treated intratracheally with PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002. Levels of phospho-Akt in airway epithelium and whole lung tissues were markedly increased in TDI group compared with control mice, which decreased after administration of LY 294002. The dilated intercellular spaces of airway epithelium induced by TDI were partially recovered by LY 294002. Both the protein expression and distribution of adherens junction proteins E-cadherin and b-catenin were altered by TDI. Treatment with LY 294002 rescued the distribution of E-cadherin and b-catenin at cell-cell membranes, restored total b-catenin pool, but had no effect on protein level of E-cadherin. At the same time, LY 294002 also inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, glycogen synthase kinase 3 b and tyrosine 654 of b-catenin induced by TDI. In summary, our results showed that the PI 3 K pathway mediates b-catenin dysregulation in a TDI-induced murine asthma model, which may be associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of b-catenin.

40|$|Introduction. Some {{reactive}} chemicals, such as diisocyanates, {{are capable}} of initiating an allergic response, {{which can lead to}} occupational asthma after a latency period. Clinical symptoms such as cough, wheezing and dyspnea occur only late, making it difficult to intervene at an early stage. So far, most studies using proteomics in lung research have focused on comparisons of healthy vs. diseased subjects. Here, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE), we explored proteome changes in the local draining lymph nodes and serum of mice dermally sensitized once or twice with toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) before <b>asthma</b> is induced to explore biomarkers of sensitization. Methods. The proteomes of male BALB/c mice (6 weeks old, 20 g), sensitized once (n= 12) or twice (n= 12) with 0. 3 % TDI, were individually compared with control mice (n= 12) in two separate experiments using 2 D-DIGE and Decyder 7. 0. A commercially available ELISA kit was used to validate the difference in hemopexin levels between TDI-sensitized and control mice. Western blotting was used to validate the results of lymphocyte specific protein 1 and coronin 1 a levels. GAPDH was used as an internal standard in Western blot validation experiments. Graphpad Prism 4. 01 (Graphpad Software Inc) was used for statistical analysis of ELISA and Western blot data. All data were normally distributed (tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov). An unpaired t-test was used to compare both groups (AOO vs. TDI). A level of p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. In the lymph nodes, we found 38 and 58 differentially expressed proteins after one and two treatments, respectively, between toluene diisocyanate-treated and vehicle-treated mice. In serum, 7 and 16 differentially expressed proteins were detected after one and two treatments, respectively. We identified 80 - 85 % of the differentially expressed proteins by mass spectrometry. Among them, lymphocyte specific protein- 1, coronin 1 a and hemopexin were verified by Western blotting or ELISA in an independent group of mice. Conclusion. This study revealed alterations in the proteomes early during sensitization in a mouse model before the onset of chemical-induced asthma.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} surrogates for individual susceptibility to organic <b>diisocyanates</b> in occupational <b>asthma.</b> Subjects: All new cases declared to the Swiss National Accident Insurance Company (SUVA) for establishment of a case for compensable occupational disease during 1993. Sixty-nine persons, of whom three were women, were suspected of having occupational asthma due to isocyanates. Of these, 47 subjects fulfilled the criteria to be accepted as an occupational disease case. Methods: All subjects were studied clinically and gave a blood sample for the phenotyping of their alpha-antitrypsin status and for immunological studies. The subjects were also given a peroral dose of caffeine for the determination of their N-acetylation capacity. Finally, those with an occupational disease were subjected to the methacholine provocation test. Results: Forty-four persons with occupational disease, out of 47, were heterozygous antitrypsin carriers and/or slow acetylators of primary amines. In the bronchial provocation with methacholine, 12 of these subjects had an unaltered response and seven had a mild reaction, 13 a moderate one and 15 a severe reaction. Interpretation: The study confirms the finding that slow N-acetylators are susceptible to asthma from exposure to common diisocyanate monomers at work. The same applies to heterozygous antitrypsin-phenotype carriers. Thus, {{the use of these}} markers may reinforce the diagnostic procedure, but they cannot completely replace the immunological tests.

In this study, the presence of IgG antibodies as well as the presence of mononuclear leukocytes reactive to different cysteine proteinases (CPs) were examined in 13 L. infantum-infected dogs (six with symptoms, seven asymptomatic). Cysteine proteinases which belong to papain-like enzymes known as clan CA are the most studied CPs of parasite protozoa. These molecules are expressed by the intracellular stages of the parasite and could be immunogenic. We studied Type II CP (CPA) and Type I CP (CPB) with its long C-terminal extension (CTE) which could be highly immunogenic. We showed that the level of antibodies reactive to rCPA is low in both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. In contrast, when CPB and CTE were used as antigens, the level of total IgG (with IgG 2 superior to IgG 1) reached higher values in asymptomatic dogs than in dogs with VL. While the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) reactivity was significant when cultured in the presence of freezed/thawed (F/T) lysate, it remained low in presence of CP although always higher for PBMC recovered from asymptomatic dogs. We showed the importance of CPB and CTE in particular as a target of immune response and their potential use for serodiagnosis in asymptomatic dogs...|$|R
40|$|Asthma and allergy are a {{worldwide}} health problem {{and especially in}} industrialized countries their incidence has increased substantially. Allergic asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by a reversible allergen-specific airway obstruction, airway inflammation and non-specific airway hyper-reactivity. In adults, 9 - 15 % of asthma cases {{can be attributed to}} occupational exposures and this makes occupational asthma the most frequent work-related lung disease. Occupational asthma can be caused by high molecular weight (pollen, flour, enzymes, ) as well as low molecular weight (chemicals, metals, resins, ) agents. Diisocyanates are chemical agents, used in isolation material, varnishes, spray paints, rubbers, etc., that frequently cause occupational asthma. The research unit of Lung Toxicology has succeeded in developing a mouse model that reflects several characteristics of chemical-induced asthma. Two dermal sensitizations followed by a single airway challenge with toluene diisocyanate resultedin a specific early airway response, followed by an airway inflammationwith an influx of neutrophils and a non-specific airway hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, we found an increase in T-helper, T-cytotoxicand B-lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes as well as an increased in vitro production of the cytokines IL- 4, IFN-γ and an increase in total serum IgE. In this doctoral thesis we focused on: a/ Optimization of the mouse model b/ Validation of the mouse model c/ Unravel the mechanisms of chemical-induced asthma To optimize the mouse model, we attempted to obtain a chronic asthma modelby exposing the mice to repeated airway challenges. However,the multiple challenges did not result in a more chronic phenotype but induced instead a state of tolerance. Multiple intranasal instillations with toluene diisocyanate led to a full waning of the airway response and airway inflammation as well as a disappearance of immunologic parameters. Nevertheless, the humoral response was still increased after multiple challenges. Next, a further optimization was obtained by changing the challenge technique from intranasal instillation to oropharyngeal aspiration. Using the latter technique, wewere able to achieve a better exposure of the lower airways while bypassing the nose. Oropharyngeal aspiration appeared to be a goodalternative for intratracheal instillation without the drawbacks of thelatter. The use of this technique yielded, besides neutrophils, also an influx of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage. In alast step of the optimization we tested besides BALB/c mice, six other mouse strains in our mouse model. We concluded that BALB/c mice reproduce the characteristics of chemical-induced asthma most closely. Large differences could be found in bronchial reactivity, immunologic and humoral responses between the different mouse strains. Furthermore, no clear distinction can be made between more T-helper 1 or T-helper 2 prone mouse strains. The mouse model was validated by testing the potential dermal sensitization capacity and subsequent response to an airway challenge of toluene diamine and ammonium persulfate. We found that toluene diamine, produced when toluene diisocyanate reacts with water, is a weak dermal sensitizer and weak asthmogen and that there is no cross-reactivity between toluene diamine and toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> in our <b>asthma</b> model. Ammonium persulfate, a known cause of occupational asthma among hairdressers, appeared to be a moderate dermal sensitizer and to produce a robust response in our asthma model. These validation studies proved that our mouse model can be used to test less potent and even weak airway sensitizers. The mechanisms of chemical-induced asthma are still unclear. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of this disease we developed an adoptive transfer protocol focusing on cellular responsesand used this to investigate the antibody-independent role of B-lymphocytes in chemical-induced asthma. The transfer of 0. 5 x 106 lymphocytes obtained from auricular lymph nodes of toluene diisocyanate sensitizedmice was sufficient to produce an asthma-like response in naïve mice after an airway challenge with toluene diisocyanate. Adoptive transfer experiments with B-lymphocytes into wild type, B knock-out and SCID miceresulted in airway hyper-reactivity and airway inflammation upon challenge with toluene diisocyanate. These data suggest an important antibody-independent role for B-lymphocytes in chemical-induced asthma. The optimization and validation of our mouse model of chemical-induced asthma has led to a better model that, in the future, could be used to identify potential asthmogens and to understand the mechanisms of action. A possibly important role for B-lymphocytes can bring a new insight into the mechanisms of non-atopic asthma. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} airway disease, characterized by chronic airway inflammation, variable airway remodeling, reversible airway obstruction and non-specific airway hyperreactivity (AHR). The respiratory symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. In adults, 9 - 15 % of all asthma cases {{are attributable to}} exposure to agents on the workplace, called occupational asthma (OA). OA is therefore {{one of the most}} common forms of occupational lung disease in many industrialized countries. Based on the presence or absence of an asymptomatic latency period, OA can be divided into two phenotypes. First, immunological OA appears after a latency period of exposure (months to years) necessary for acquiring immune sensitization to the causal agent. This phenotype of OA encompasses OA induced by an immunoglobulin (Ig) E mediated mechanism (most high- and some low- molecular weight agents), and OA in which the IgE mechanism has not been consistently demonstrated (low molecular weight agents such as western red cedar, acrylates and isocyanates). Second, non-immunological OA, in which asthma occurs after an acute exposure to high concentrations of an irritant, without a latency period, termed irritant-induced <b>asthma.</b> <b>Diisocyanates</b> are reactive chemicals, used in the polyurethane industry for the manufacture of flexible and rigid foams, fibers, paints and varnishes. They are one of the most important causes of OA. Low airborne levels of diisocyanates, even below the established permissible exposure level, can trigger asthmatic reactions in individuals sensitized to diisocyanates. An important difference between protein-induced allergic asthma and chemical-induced asthma, is that the chemicals first need to bind to endogenous proteins before they become recognizable by the immune system resulting in a different, not yet fully delineated mechanism of action. In this doctoral thesis, we used an established acute mouse model of chemical-induced asthma. This model consists of a dermal sensitization phase followed by a single airway exposure. This acute exposure model results in AHR and airway inflammation that is mainly dominated by neutrophils in conjunction with the presence of eosinophils. This acute mouse model has been suitable to validate chemicals for their asthmatic potency and to study several key players in chemical-induced asthma. However, due to the short-term exposure time, there are some limitations in this model such as the absence of a robust lung inflammation and airway remodeling. Therefore, we developed a chronic and a sub-chronic mouse model of chemical-induced asthma. Study of the cross-reactivity between MDI and TDI In the first part of this thesis, we optimized the acute mouse model using 2, 4 -toluene diisocyanate in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, and validated the sensitization and asthmogenic potency of 4, 4 -methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Both TDI and MDI were potent sensitizers and asthmogens in the C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. However MDI was, compared to TDI, a somewhat weaker dermal sensitizer and asthmogen. Additionally, we investigated whether there is cross-reactivity between TDI and MDI. We studied the cross-reactivity between TDI and MDI by dermally sensitizing mice with TDI followed by an airway challenge with MDI and vice versa. In this acute model, with a single airway challenge, we did not observed cross-reactivity between TDI and MDI. Development of a chronic and sub-chronic mouse model and study the presence of dendritic cells Development of a chronic intranasal mouse model In the second part of this thesis, we attempted to obtain a severe chemical-induced asthmatic phenotype with pronounced lung inflammation and airway remodeling. Chronic intranasal exposure (daily intranasal instillation exposure – 5 days a week - for five consecutive weeks) resulted in a predominant T helper (Th 1) systemic immune response, without AHR nor recruitment of inflammatory and dendritic cells (DC). By adding prior dermal sensitization, intranasal exposures resulted in a predominant systemic Th 2 immune response accompanied with AHR. Still, the AHR was not accompanied with airway inflammation nor recruitment of DC in the lung, mimicking the clinically relevant paucigranulocytic phenotype of asthma. As a conclusion, dermal contact with TDI prior to long-term respiratory exposures determines the outcome of systemic immune sensitization and the presence of AHR. Development of a sub-chronic oropharyngeal mouse model Since we were unable to find airway inflammation in the chronic intranasal mouse model, the last part of this thesis focused on the development of a mouse model using an oropharyngeal instillation technique to expose the lower airways to TDI. Multiple oropharyngeal TDI exposures resulted in airway inflammation accompanied with DC recruitment to the lung, which is indicative of the initiation of an adaptive immune response in the lung. However, the type of inflammation is shaped by the route of exposure. Without skin exposure the inflammation is dominated by mainly neutrophils, which is indicative for irritant-induced inflammation, while prior skin sensitization with TDI resulted in an eosinophilic airway inflammation accompanied with AHR, which is indicative for an immune-mediated inflammatory phenotype of asthma. As a conclusion, DC are recruited to the lungs in the presence of inflammation, and pre-dermal contact with TDI determines the type of lung inflammation (eosinophilic versus neutrophilic) and the presence of AHR. status: publishe...|$|R
