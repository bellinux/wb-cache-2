SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling.</b> This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of an external field acting differently {{on the two}} constituents of a binary colloidal mixture performing Brownian dynamics is investigated by computer simulations and a simple theory. In our model, half of the particles (A particles) are pulled by an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> F (A) while the other half (B particles) are pulled by an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> F (B). If F (A) and F (B) are parallel and the field-free state is a mixed fluid, previous simulations (Dzubiella J et al 2002 Phys. Rev. E 65 021402) have shown a nonequilibrium pattern formation involving lanes of A or B particles only, which are sliding {{against each other in}} the direction of the <b>external</b> <b>forces.</b> In this paper, we generalize the situation both to nonparallel <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> and to field-free crystalline states. For nonparallel forces, lane formation is also observed but with an orientation tilted with respect to the <b>external</b> <b>forces.</b> If the field-free state is crystalline, a continuous increase of the parallel <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> yields a novel re-entrant freezing behaviour: the crystal first melts mechanically via the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> and then recrystallizes into demixed crystalline lanes sliding against each other. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} heterogeneous diffusion processes with the power-law {{dependence of the}} diffusion coefficient on the position and investigate the influence of <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> on the resulting anomalous diffusion. The heterogeneous diffusion processes can yield subdiffusion as well as superdiffusion, depending {{on the behavior of}} the diffusion coefficient. We assume that not only the diffusion coefficient but also the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> has a power-law dependence on the position. We obtain analytic expressions for the transition probability in two cases: when the power-law exponent in the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> is equal to 2 eta- 1, where 2 eta is the power-law exponent in the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position, and when the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> has a linear dependence on the position. We found that the power-law exponent in the dependence of the mean square displacement on time does not depend on the <b>external</b> <b>force,</b> this force changes only the anomalous diffusion coefficient. In addition, the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> having the power-law exponent different from 2 eta- 1 limits the time interval where the anomalous diffusion occurs.

Both theoretical analysis {{based on the}} kinetic model equation and numerical study are presented to demonstrate the dynamic effect of <b>external</b> <b>force</b> on the flow evolution, especially on the non-equilibrium heat flux. The current numerical experiment {{is based on the}} well-balanced unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), which presents accurate solutions in the whole flow regime from the continuum Navier-Stokes solution to the transition and free molecular ones. The heat conduction in the non-equilibrium regime due to the <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> term is quantitatively investigated. In the lid-driven cavity flow study, due to the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> field the density distribution inside cavity gets stratified and a multiscale non-equilibrium flow transport appears in a single gas dynamic system. With the increment of <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> term, the flow topological structure changes dramatically, and the temperature gradient, shearing stress, and <b>external</b> <b>force</b> play different roles in determination of the heat flux in different layers corresponding to different flow regime. Besides the non-Fourier's heat effect in the transition regime, such as the heat flux from cold to hot region in the absence of external field, the additional <b>external</b> <b>force</b> enhances the heat flux significantly along the forcing direction, which could trigger the gravity-thermal instability through the heat flow from the high potential cold region to the low potential hot region.
