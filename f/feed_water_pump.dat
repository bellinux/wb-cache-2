50|$|In the Three Mile Island disaster, a main <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> shut down, {{although}} {{the cause is}} not known. Without that pump, the steam generator wasn't able to remove heat from the reactor, so pressure in the reactor began to rise. The system automatically began to dump water from the reactor to reduce pressure, but the relief valve got stuck open when the automation told it to close. The control room indicated that the valve was closed. The staff, therefore, {{had no idea that}} they were dumping radioactive water out of one of their reactors. With the water being pumped out, there wasn't enough emergency cooling water and the staff was unaware that they were losing more by the minute. Without adequate cooling, one of the reactors began to melt. The pipes burst and about half the core melted during the accident. Unlike Chernobyl and other nuclear disasters, the containment house around the reactor held and the damage to the outside world was very minimal. Since the containment housing held, no radioactive particles were released into the atmosphere, like what happened in Fukushima. The release of radioactive water did damage and contaminate the local area, but it did not spread from there.|$|E
5000|$|In {{water tube}} boilers, {{the way the}} water is {{recirculated}} inside the boiler before becoming steam {{can be described as}} either natural circulation or forced circulation. In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam. What makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in. In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam {{to the top of the}} furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the forced circulation boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a forced circulation boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler ...|$|E

In this paper, the cost data of various units of thermal power plant in terms of power output capacity have been fitted using power law {{with the help of}} the data collected from a literature search. To have a realistic estimate of primary components or equipment, it is necessary to include the latest cost of these components. The cost analysis of the plant was carried out on the basis of total capital investment, operating cost and revenue. The total capital investment includes the total direct plant cost and total indirect plant cost. Total direct plant cost involves the cost of equipment (i.e. boiler, steam turbine, condenser, generator and auxiliary equipment including condensate extraction pump, <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump,</b> etc.) and other costs associated with piping, electrical, civil works, direct installation cost, auxiliary services, instrumentation and controls, and site preparation. The total indirect plant cost includes the cost of engineering and set-up. The net present value method was adopted for the present study. The work presented in this paper is an endeavour to study the influence of some of the important parameters on the lifetime costs of a coal-fired power plant. For this purpose, parametric study with and without escalation rates for a period of 35  years plant life was evaluated.

A water, steam and helium multi-phase cavity model is developed and implemented in the DSNP simulation system. The DSNP system is then used to simulate the primary and secondary circuit of a HTR-MODULE power plant. Comparisons of the model with experiments and with TIN 1 M calculations serve as validation of the simulation. The analysis of the primary circuit tries to answer the question how fast the water enters the reactor core. It was found that the maximum H$_{ 2 }$O concentration increase in the reactor core is smaller than 0. 3 kg/(m$^{ 3 }$s) The liquid water vaporization in the steam generator and H$_{ 2 }$O transport from the steam generator to the reactor core reduce the ingress velocity of the H$_{ 2 }$O into the reactor core.

Exposure to occupational noise is the pervasive physical agent in industries like power plants and may impact health and for safety status for people. Determination of the sources of noise in workplaces is important step in noise control plans. This study aimed to assess noise pollution and determine the main sources of noise in a power plant for.. Material and Method: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted {{on the ground floor of}} the turbine unit of a thermal power plant. Measurements was done based on the ISO- 9612 and ISO- 11200 standard using by the calibrated sound level meter model TES- 1389 on “A” frequency weighting and “Slow” mode for time response. Surfer V. 10 software was used for interpolation and noise maps producing.

40|$|In recent years, the {{simulation}} methods {{for the safety}} analysis of nuclear power plants have been continuously improved to perform realistic calculations. Therefore in VALCO work package 2 (WP 2), the usual application of coupled neutron-kinetic / thermal-hydraulic codes to VVER has been supplemented by systematic uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. A comprehensive uncertainty analysis has been carried out. The GRS uncertainty and sensitivity method based on the statistical code package SUSA {{was applied to the}} two transients studied earlier in SRR- 1 / 95 : A load drop of one turbo-generator in Loviisa- 1 (VVER- 440), and a switch-off of one <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> in Balakovo- 4 (VVER- 1000). The main steps of these analyses and the results obtained by applying different coupled code systems (SMABRE - HEXTRAN, ATHLET - DYN 3 D, ATHLET - KIKO 3 D, ATHLET -BIPR- 8) are described in this report. The application of this method is only based on variations of input parameter values. No internal code adjustments are needed. An essential result of the analysis using the GRS SUSA methodology is the identification of the input parameters, such as the secondary-circuit pressure, the control-assembly position (as a function of time), and the control-assembly efficiency, that most sensitively affect safety-relevant output parameters, like reactor power, coolant heat-up, and primary pressure. Uncertainty bands for these output parameters have been derived. The variation of potentially uncertain input parameter values as a consequence of uncertain knowledge can activate system actions causing quite different transient evolutions. This gives indications about possible plant conditions that might be reached from the initiating event assuming only small disturbances. In this way, the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis reveals the spectrum of possible transient evolutions. Deviations of SRR- 1 / 95 coupled code calculations from measurements also led to the objective to separate neutron kinetics from thermal-hydraulic feedback effects. Thus, in VALCO work package 3 (WP 3) stand-alone three-dimensional neutron-kinetic codes have been validated. Measurements carried out in an original-size VVER- 1000 mock-up (V- 1000 facility, Kurchatov Institute Moscow) were used for the validation of the codes DYN 3 D, HEXTRAN, KIKO 3 D and BIPR- 8, which are chiefly designed for VVER safety calculations. The significant neutron flux tilt measured in the V- 1000 core, which is caused only by radial-reflector asymmetries, was successfully modelled. A good agreement between calculated and measured steady-state powers has been achieved, for relative assembly powers and inner-assembly pin power distributions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The use {{of solar}} heat in {{conventional}} {{coal-fired power plants}} has been demonstrated to reduce the coal consumption of the plant. A reduction {{in the amount of}} coal that is burnt by the power plant, means that less greenhouse gases are emitted by the power plant. Hence, the plant has a smaller impact on global warming. Countries such as Australia and the USA have implemented this concept of adding solar heat to a coal-fired power plant. This study investigates if solar heat addition to Duvha Power Station in Mpumalanga, South Africa, is technically and economically feasible. Duvha Power Station {{is one of the largest}} coal-fired power stations in Eskom. Two solar heat integration options were examined in this study i. e. the use of solar heat to heat feed water or to produce superheated steam. A market assessment of concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies was performed to establish the maximum water/steam conditions (temperature and pressure) that can be produced by each CSP technology. The CSP technologies assessed were the parabolic trough collector (PTC), the linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) and the central receiver (CR). By using the results of the market assessment, a suitable CSP technology was selected for each integration option. The technical capabilities of each plant area of Duvha Power Station, such as the boiler, turbines, <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> etc., was also assessed by reviewing original equipment manufacturer (OEM) data sheets. The solar field size of each integration option was determined through an iterative method, such that none of the technical capabilities of the power station were exceeded once solar heat was added. The annual hourly heat output of each solar field was thereafter predicted by using the System Advisor Model (SAM). The annual hourly heat output of each solar field was then used with a thermodynamic model of Duvha Power Station(referred to as the Duvha Virtual Plant TM model),to calculate the hourly project benefits. The hourly benefits are coal savings, greenhouse gas emission reduction, solar electricity etc. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) of each integration option was calculated by using cost models provided in SAM. The benefits and costs of each integration option were used in an economic life-cycle assessment (LCA) model, to determine the most economically feasible integration option. It was found that the integration options that produced high-temperature steam have the highest integration effectiveness, such as the steam supply to the high-pressure turbine etc. The LCA revealed that the supply of steam, by using the LFR,to the highest pressure feedwater heater (HPH 6), is the most economical option. This is because the LFR technology has the lowest CAPEX and fixed OPEX cost amongst the 3 CSP technologies.

The <b>water</b> is <b>pumped</b> {{from the top of the}} {{steam generator}} down to the bottom and out. The tubes that are arranged in such a way that the combustion gasses pass around the tube subsequently heating the water. Essentially, the arrangement can be best described as having a large thin walled coil of pipe wrapping around the circumference of a vertical steel drum looping around and down until it reaches the bottom. As only some of the water may become steam, it is important to separate the two and send any water back through to absorb more heat. If this separation does not occur, the damage to the system could be costly. If steam goes through the generation tubes inside, the tubes may overheat and become weak, and if water is allowed down into the steam system, corrosion, water hammer, or other ill effects may occur. To combat this, after exiting the steam generator, the mixture is put through a centrifugal steam separator which does exactly that producing steam that is above ninety-nine percent dry saturated steam. If superheated steam is desired, an additional coil is run back through the steam generator. To maintain a constant level of water in the steam separator, the feed pump in conjunction with a leveling system is utilized. A great advantage to this system is that steam can be generated very quickly. However, the downside to this system is the complete dependence on a constant supply of <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> Without the constant supply, the system may be subject to a massive and expensive damage ...|$|R

Dabei wird das vollstaendige Versagen aller aktiven Sicherheitssysteme unterstellt mit dem Ziel, die Sicherheitsreserven der HTR-MODUL Auslegung auszuloten und eine katastrophenfreie Kerntechnik zu realisieren. Es wurde ein Mehrphasenmodell fuer eine wasser-, dampf- und heliumgefuellte Kaverne entwickelt und in das Simulationssystem DSNP eingebaut. DSNP wird dann benutzt, um den Primaer- und Sekundaerkreislauf eines HTR-MODUL-Kraftwerkes zu simulieren. Vergleiche dieses Modells mit Experimenten und dem Programmsystem TINTE dienten der Validierung der Neuentwicklung. Die Analyse des Primaerkreislaufs zeigt, wie schnell das Wasser in den Reaktorkern gelangen kann. Die Untersuchungen ergaben, dass der Konzentrationsanstieg des Wassers im Kern kleiner als 0. 3 kg/(m" 3 s) ist. Die Verdampfung des Wassers im Dampferzeuger und der Transport von dort zum Reaktorkern reduzieren die Eintrittsgeschwindigkeit des Wassers in den Kern sehr deutlich. Zur Beantwortung der Frage, wieviel Wasser maximal in den Primaerkreis gelangen kann, wurde die vollstaendige Kavitation der Speisewasserpumpen untersucht. Wenn der Sekundaerkreis hinreichend druckentlastet wird, bleiben die Speisewasserpumpen aufgrund der einsetzenden Kavitation von selbst stehen. Dadurch wird die vom Speisewasserbehaelter zum Dampferzeuger transportierte Wassermenge begrenzt. Eine ausfuehrliche Simulation des gesamten HTR-MODUL-Kraftwerkes zeigte dann, dass so das moegliche Wasserinventar im Primaerkreis auf 3000 kg begrenzt werden kann.

Comparisons of the model with experiments and with TINTE calculations serve as validation of the simulation. The analysis of the primary circuit tries to answer the question how fast the water enters the reactor core. It was found that the maximum H_ 2 O concentration increase in the reactor core is smaller than 0. 3 kg/(m" 3 s). The liquid water vaporization in the steam generator and H_ 2 O transport from the steam generator to the reactor core reduce the ingress velocity of the H_ 2 O into the reactor core. In order to answer the question how much water enters the primary circuit, the full cavitation of the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> is analyzed. It is found that if the secondary circuit is depressurized enough, the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> will be inherently stopped by the full cavitation. This limits the <b>water</b> to be <b>pumped</b> from the deaerator to the steam generator. A comprehensive simulation of the MODUL-HTR power plant then shows that the H_ 2 O inventory in the primary circuit can be limited to about 3000 kg. The nuclear reactivity increase caused by the water ingress leads to a fast power excursion, which, however, is inherently counterbalanced by negative feedback effects. Concerning the integrity of the fuel elements, the safety relevant temperature limit of 1600 C was not reached in any case. (orig.)

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{studying}} centrifugal pump’s variable speed drive’s advantages in Alfa Laval Aalborg’s steam boiler applications. Thesis {{consists of two}} main parts. First part examines requirements set for variable frequency drives in standards, regulations and classification societies’ rules. This part {{can be divided into}} two parts, requirements for industrial applications and requirements for use in marine applications. Second main part of the thesis is to compare different pump system configurations for Alfa Laval Aalborg’s steam system’s <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> system. This part consists of investment cost analysis for different pump system configurations and from operational cost calculations for these pumping systems. Investment cost analysis includes procurement costs of parts needed in the pumping systems and pump unit assembly costs. Operational cost analysis studies pump systems’ energy consumption and costs derived from the energy consumption. These two parts combined together form cost analysis for the system. Cost analysis is done for two different types of steam generation systems. First analysis is done for diesel power plant’s waste heat recovery system and second analysis is carried out for ship’s steam production system. The analyses are carried out separately because systems’ operation profiles are different and therefore operational cost analysis needs to be carried out separately. Cost analysis show how cost effective variable speed drive can be in this applications. Operational cost calculations are done according centrifugal pump theory. This theory is introduced in the thesis and is been used to explain why variable speed drive in centrifugal pump application is able to save significant amounts of energy compared to direct drive application...|$|R

5000|$|Kolindsund (The Sound of Kolind) is a 26.4 square {{kilometer}} [...] elongated drained lake on {{the peninsula}} Djursland in Denmark extending 25 kilometers inland to the west from the seaport Grenå by the Kattegat sea. The bottom of the drained lake is on average 2.5 meters below sea level. Today the area is rich farmland kept dry by means of two pumping stations. At each station a 240 HP pump is turned on as needed regulated by the water level in the canals that <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> to the <b>pumps.</b> The width of Kolindsund varies between 0.8 kilometers and 2.5 kilometers.|$|R
25|$|Following re-assembly, the {{locomotive}} was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog {{station on the}} Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|R
50|$|The main {{new feature}} was the boiler which {{formed the basis}} of later {{developments}} from 1930 onwards after the Doble company folded. Various other refinements were applied to individual cars such as a steam driven <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> Seven model Fs were made, one of which was owned by Abner Doble's wife. They were car numbers 30 to 35, and 39. One of these, number 35, was a chassis only and sold to Oscar Henschel in Germany. Henschel's car was used by Hermann Göring and believed destroyed during the war. The car bodies were otherwise sedans or phaetons. The last F car number 39 was owned by Warren Doble. Engine number 32 was fitted into a Buick.|$|R
