Though many of the old reserves are depleted, and the price of land for housing has pushed many of the rigs off the landscape, oil pumps can still be found to dot the city.|$|E

As a result, the top two candidates, center-left Nueva Mayoría coalition's Michelle Bachelet and center-right Alianza coalition's Evelyn Matthei, competed in a run-off election on 15 December 2013, which Bachelet won. This was Chile's sixth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All six have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.|$|E

25|$|Before his death, Arana {{had planned}} {{to run in the}} {{upcoming}} 1950 presidential elections. His death left Árbenz without any serious contenders in the elections (leading some, including the CIA and U.S. military intelligence, to speculate that Árbenz personally had him eliminated for this reason). Árbenz <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3 times as many votes as the runner-up, Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes. Fuentes claimed that electoral fraud benefited Árbenz; however scholars have pointed out that while fraud may possibly have given Árbenz some of his votes, it was not the reason that he won the election. In 1950s Guatemala, only literate men were able to vote by secret ballot; illiterate men and literate women voted by open ballot. Illiterate women were not enfranchised at all.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe was {{eventually}} dismissed seven runs {{short of a}} century, caught by wicket-keeper Dawood off Tim Bresnan's bowling, and Bresnan got another wicket when he trapped Mal Loye lbw. Bresnan and Deon Kruis were Yorkshire's best bowlers, sharing nine of the ten wickets, and starting with Sutcliffe's dismissal, Lancashire lost five wickets for 27 runs to Bresnan and Kruis. However, 146 from Andrew Symonds, and half-centuries from Dominic Cork and Warren Hegg gave Lancashire a 120-run lead. Yorkshire batted to stumps on day three without loss, and survived 89 overs {{on the fourth day}} with ease. Craig White, Anthony McGrath and Matthew Wood all made fifties for Yorkshire, while no Lancashire bowler <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one wicket. Yorkshire remained 2.5 points ahead of Lancashire in the Championship table, but were third following Essex' victory over Derbyshire.|$|E
25|$|In two of {{the general}} elections, in 1940 and 1968, they <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50%; however, both cases had special circumstances. In 1940 all {{established}} Swedish parties, except for the Communist Party, had a coalition government due to {{the pressures of the}} Second World War, and it can be speculated that it led to voters most likely wanting one party to be in majority to give a parliament that couldn't be hung. In 1944 the tides of the war had turned and the allied nations looked to win, giving voters more confidence in voting by preference and explaining the more normal electoral result of 46.6%. Also there might very well have been some resentment among parts of the public regarding how the Communist Party was held out of the government, and in 1944 they got 10.3%. In 1968 the established Communist Party, most likely due to bad press about the communist overtaking of Czechoslovakia, got a historically very bad result of 3% of the votes, while the Social Democrats enjoyed 50.1% and their own majority in parliament.|$|E

25|$|Former India A leg-spinner Yogesh Golwalkar {{took three}} wickets in each innings and helped Middlesex to {{dominance}} on points {{in his first}} first class game in England, though he had played two non-first class games for Essex Second XI in May. Kent had won the toss and batted first, struggling to 249 for 9 despite 94 from Darren Stevens, but Justin Kemp and Amjad Khan added 135 for the last wicket before Kemp was bowled by Jamie Dalrymple for 102. Middlesex still went past Kent's total of 384, however, amassing a lead as Ben Hutton and Owais Shah made centuries, and Kent's bowling was woefully unpenetrative. Only Kemp <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two wickets, and he got numbers eight, nine and ten in the batting order. Middlesex captain Hutton batted {{for more than six}} hours for a career-best 152, while Shah's 128 was his seventh Championship century of the season. Dalrymple and Ed Joyce added fifties as Middlesex made their way to 550 for 9 at stumps on day three. Golwalkar took three wickets on the final day, but it was not enough, as Kent made it to 192 for 7 to save the draw - Andrew Hall grinding out 26 in the last 51 minutes with Niall O'Brien before conditions stopped play.|$|E
25|$|The Videocon Tri-Series was a three-team One Day International cricket tournament {{taking place}} in Zimbabwe between the hosts Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand. It started on 24 August 2005 and ended with the final on 6 September 2005, which New Zealand won by six wickets. Zimbabwe ended the tournament without a victory against a team other than rock-bottom Bangladesh for 35 ODI matches, since November 2003. Their last series win against a team other than Bangladesh or Kenya was, intriguingly, against New Zealand, in the 2000–01 season. India are still without a tournament win since March 2004, coming off an 18-run defeat by Sri Lanka in {{the final of the}} 2005 Indian Oil Cup, while New Zealand were {{comprehensively}} defeated 5–0 by Australia at home in their last series before this tournament. Before that, however, they were undefeated in six tournaments. The Supersub rule, which means that a player can be substituted for another at any time, but once the player is off he can not return, was introduced for this tournament. The stand-out performances came from Indian Mohammad Kaif, who hit 277 runs and was made Man of the Series, but Yuvraj Singh, and New Zealanders Stephen Fleming and Lou Vincent also passed 200 runs. On the bowling side, Shane Bond took 11 wickets at an average of just 8.63, despite being rested for one match, and Indian seamers Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar also <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 wickets.|$|E
25|$|The main beaches on the Dieppe {{waterfront}} {{are almost}} a mile long. Following strafing of the defenses by aircraft, {{and a short}} bombardment by destroyers, aircraft laid a blanket of smoke on Dieppe Harbour. LCSs with heavy machine-guns and smoke mortars engaged targets ashore and provided a smoke-screen over the eastern headlands. The LCSs continued to engage targets all morning, but also suffered extensively from the defenders' fire. The first wave of LCAs touched down between 05:20 and 05:23. They carried The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry to Red Beach and The Essex Scottish Regiment to White Beach. Once the infantry left the armour-plated protection of the LCAs {{they were in a}} killing field. None of the preparatory fire had diminished the defense, and the new tank landing craft, designed to deliver tanks to accompany the assault infantry, were ten minutes late. As the smoke drifted off, the Canadians found themselves savagely pinned down. Their landing craft, LCAs and LCM(Mk. I)s, had orders to collect off the coast in the boat pool - an area covered in smoke. Adding to the tragedy, the floating reserve, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, were sent to reinforce the Essex Scottish, who had been incorrectly reported as making good progress. The Fusiliers were transported in LCP(L) Eureka boats made of seven-plywood; they provided no protection from bullets or shrapnel. The Fusiliers received fire all the way in to the beach, and only 125 of them made it back to England. On White Beach, LCAs landed 369 men of A Commando Royal Marines in withering fire - none <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few yards ashore.|$|E

500|$|The {{election}} {{was held on}} November 15, 1950, with Árbenz winning more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were largely free and fair {{with the exception of}} the disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. Árbenz <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three times as many votes as the runner-up, Ydígoras Fuentes. Fuentes claimed electoral fraud had benefited Árbenz, but scholars have pointed out that while fraud may possibly have given Árbenz some of his votes, it was not the reason that he won the election. Árbenz's promise of land reform played a large role in ensuring his victory. The election of Árbenz alarmed US State Department officials, who stated that Arana [...] "has always represented the only positive conservative element in the Arévalo administration" [...] and that his death would [...] "strengthen [...] materially", and that [...] "developments forecast sharp leftist trend within the government."

On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 or 25 percent.
