5000|$|Mature plum fruit {{may have}} a dusty-white waxy coating that gives them a <b>glaucous</b> <b>appearance.</b> This is an epicuticular wax coating and is known as [...] "wax bloom". Dried plum fruits are called dried plums or prunes, although, in American English, prunes are a {{distinct}} type of plum, and may have pre-dated the fruits now commonly known as plums.|$|E
50|$|The epicuticular {{wax coating}} on mature plum fruit {{gives them a}} <b>glaucous</b> <b>appearance.</b> Another {{familiar}} example {{is found in the}} common grape genus (Vitis vinifera). Some cacti have a glaucous coating on their stem(s). Glaucous coatings are hydrophobic so as to prevent wetting by rain. Their waxy character serves to hinder climbing of leaves, stem or fruit by insects. On fruits, glaucous coatings may function as a deterrent to climbing and feeding by small insects in favor of increased seed dispersal offered by larger animals such as mammals and birds.|$|E
40|$|We report eight new mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana {{possessing}} altered leaf morphology and epicuticular wax. These {{were isolated}} from a T-DNA-mutagenized population using a visual screen for altered leaf reflectance, i. e. increased glaucousness or glossiness. The mutants were placed into three distinct classes based on alterations in overall plant morphology: knobhead (knb), bicentifolia (bcf), and wax. The four knb mutants formed callus-like growths in the axillary {{region of the}} rosette leaves and apical meristem, the two bcf mutants produced hundreds of narrow leaves, and the two wax mutants had leaves and stems that were more glossy than wild type and organs that fused during early development. Leaves of knb and bcf were more glaucous and abnormally shaped than wild type. Epicuticular wax crystals over knb and bcf leaf surfaces (where none were present on wild type) likely contributed to their more <b>glaucous</b> <b>appearance.</b> In contrast, the glossy appearance of the wax mutants {{was associated with a}} reduced epicuticular wax load on both leaves and stems. One representative from each phenotypic class was selected for detailed analyses of epicuticular wax chemistry. All three lines, knb 1, bcf 1, and wax 1, had dramatic alterations in the total amounts and relative proportions of their leaf epicuticular wax constituents...|$|E
