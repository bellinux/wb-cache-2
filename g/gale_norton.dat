500|$|A {{separate}} controversy {{surrounds the}} use {{of water in the}} Upper Klamath Basin for irrigated agriculture, which was temporarily halted in 2001 to protect endangered salmon and lake fish during a severe drought. Vice President Dick Cheney personally intervened to ensure water to the agriculture industry rather than to environmental flow. In 2002, the federal government, under Interior Secretary <b>Gale</b> <b>Norton,</b> provided full water deliveries to irrigators as the drought continued; despite the fact that Klamath area tribes have treaty rights that predate the settlement of the farmers. Norton argued for a [...] "free market" [...] approach by allowing farmers to sell the water to the Native Americans downstream. That year, the Klamath River system had the largest fish die-off ever recorded. [...] The House Natural Resources Committee investigated Vice President Cheney for having released extra water to ranchers for possible political gain.|$|E
