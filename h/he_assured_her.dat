25|$|They {{carried on}} a {{significant}} correspondence, exchanging over 1,200 letters between 1877 and 1890. The details they shared were extraordinary for two people who never met. He was more open to her about {{much of his life}} and his creative processes than to any other person. Her feedback became so important to him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing. Von Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter with all the rest for posterity to find.|$|E

He lived in Money, Mississippi, {{a small town}} in the Delta that consisted of three stores, a school, a post office, a cotton gin, and a few hundred residents, [...] north of Greenwood. Before Emmett departed for the Delta, his mother cautioned him that Chicago and Mississippi were two different worlds, and he should know how to behave in front of whites in the South.

500|$|Pfeiffer lent {{her voice}} for the {{character}} of goddess of chaos Eris in [...] (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt {{as the voice of}} Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was [...] "too sexual," [...] then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him [...] "You know, you really can fire me.", but <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely {{out of the public eye}} to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film [...] (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.|$|E
500|$|In late July 1843 Balzac {{visited her}} in St. Petersburg, {{the first time}} they had seen one another in eight years. He was struck by Hańska's {{resilient}} beauty, but his condition had deteriorated over the years. Biographers agree that she was much less physically attracted to him at this time. Still they renewed their vows of love and planned to marry as soon as she won her lawsuit. In early October he returned to Paris. Soon afterwards, she wrote a story based on her own experience writing to Balzac for the first time. Unhappy with it, she threw it into the fire, but the French author begged her to rewrite it so he could adapt it. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that she would [...] "know something of the joys of authorship when you see how much of your elegant and delightful writing I have preserved". Her story became Modeste Mignon, Balzac's 1844 novel about a young woman who writes to her favorite poet.|$|E
500|$|The many famous {{students}} {{educated at}} the abbey included the noted abbess and princess Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, and Louise d'Esparbès de Lussan, {{the mistress of}} the Count of Artois, the future Charles X of France. Thomas Jefferson's daughters Martha and Mary were both educated at the Pentemont Abbey while he was Minister to France. [...] Their entry into the school {{was sponsored by the}} wife of the Marquis de Lafayette. [...] The future first lady Abigail Adams was shocked that Jefferson would send his girls to a Catholic school but <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that there were many Protestants at the abbey. [...] Conditions were austere for the students, despite the presence of three princesses, with no fires until the water froze and a prohibition on speaking outside of class and recreation. [...] Her time at the school led Martha, nicknamed Patsy, to write a letter to her father expressing her desire to become a nun. [...] Jefferson quickly removed his daughters from the care of the convent.|$|E

500|$|Strindberg wooed Bosse {{by sending}} her books about {{theosophy}} and the occult, {{by attempting to}} mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. [...] Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in Easter (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, {{turned out to be}} Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands on my shoulders, looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E

She was considered in Spain as a foreign Princess aiming at gaining a throne for her son. Arriving at Bayonne, Maria Luisa was greeted by her father with the words [...] "My daughter, our family has forever ceased to reign". Napoleon had forced both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to renounce the throne of Spain and {{in exchange for their}} renunciation of all claims, were promised a large pension and residence in Compiegne and Château de Chambord. Maria Luisa, who in vain tried to convince Napoleon to restore her to Tuscany or Parma, was offered a large income. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>her</b> that she would be much happier without the troubles of government, but Maria Luisa openly protested against the confiscation of her son's dominions.|$|E
