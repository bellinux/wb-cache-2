40|$|Genetic {{variability}} is {{the basis}} of plant breeding. In corn, a large and diverse genetic pool permits manipulation of different genotypes, but the genetic diversity of tropical germplasm has been little studied. With the objective of analyzing the amplitude of the genetic variability in 15 hybrids released in different periods by three different seed companies, phenotypic and molecular characterization was carried out in three environments and at two plant densities. The phenotypic assessment showed great similarity among the hybrids, suggesting that the breeding programs have developed genotypes with similar phenotypic traits. The dendogram of the molecular analysis showed clustering according with the different companies suggesting that each corn breeding program make use of different <b>germoplasms.</b> However, although the germplasm was different, it could be inferred that the selection pressure used by the breeders followed the same traits such as plant height, number of rows per ear and kernel weight among others analyzed in the present study, that contributed to the phenotypic uniformity of the genotype...|$|R

40|$|ITNel presente lavoro viene illustrata un’indagine preliminare volta all’individuazione di varietà intraspecifiche di Cucumis melo L., un ortaggio indicato con nomi differenti a seconda dei comprensori salentini e noto nei comuni baresi con il nome di carosello. In questi ultimi anni, l’interesse dei produttori ma, soprattutto dei commercianti, tende ad una denominazione unica, meloncella, derivante dalla sua affinità con il melone dolce, consumato come frutto assai dolce e dalla polpa gialla (o verde chiaro in alcune varietà). Sono state effettuate prospezioni territoriali che hanno permesso di conoscere contadini-custodi dai quali acquisire sementi di questo ortaggio così comune ma così diverso a seconda dei comuni interessati dalle indagini. Le sementi collezionate sono state utilizzate poi per la caratterizzazione morfometrica delle piante e dei frutti eduli (peponidi). In definitiva, il germoplasma reperito corrispondeva a ben 3 varietà di melone dolce e 13 di meloncelle (2 delle quali non hanno germinato); le 11 accessioni di meloncelle corrispondevano a 6 sub-varietà che differiscono per caratteri morfologici ma anche organolettici. ENIn {{the last}} years, demand for typical {{products}} and local varieties considerably increased, leading agricultural research institutes at detection and retrieval <b>germoplasm</b> {{to define the}} agricultural biodiversity in relevance area. Most {{of the characteristics of}} locally grown vegetable varieties do not match the food industry requirements. More over these varieties are old farmers' prerogative, who like to taste the flavor of a past time. The agricultural land abandon risks to induce these varieties to disappear quickly. This paper describes a preliminary investigation carried out to identify the inter-variety diversity of Cucumis melo, a vegetable exclusive of the Bari and Salento area (Apulia), which recently is affecting the market with its production also at national level. The present work tries to estimate how many and what varieties they still continue to be cultivated and preserved by farmers. Regional exploration have been carried out in order to find <b>germoplasm</b> of Cucumis melo in the different districts of Salento but, above all, {{to learn more about the}} farmers who are working to keep alive these varieties, renewing annually seed production with techniques environmentally preserving the rural context. The <b>germoplasm</b> collected has allowed us to initiate studies on the morphological characterization of varieties. Already from a morphological examination of the seeds, it was obvious that an incredible diversity of phenotypes and genotypes exist of the same vegetable. For each sample open field cultivation have been carried out to obtain the morphometric characterization of seeds, leaves, stems, flowers and fruit. Production parameters and the quality of fruits from each variety were also evaluated. Finally, the <b>germoplasm</b> found out corresponded to 3 different varieties of sweet melon and 13 meloncelle (2 of which didn’t germinated); the 11 varieties in production corresponded to 6 well distinct cultivars.

The embryogenic potencial of three explant (shoop top; leaf blade from in vitro plants; inflorecense bud) under differents iluminated conditions and six rates (0; 0. 56; 1. 12; 1. 68; 2. 24; 2. 81 µmol. l- 1). of two auxins (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacético acid and Dicamba) was tested. Evaluations after second subculture (60 day) were carried out. Stadistical differences within evaluated explants {{and rates of}} auxins were found. It was possible to select meristematic apice, 1. 12 mmol. l- 1 of 2, 4 -D as the best explant, rate and auxin for the establishment by the first time of the somatic embryogenesis of henequén (Agave fourcroydes Lem).

In the explored space, 20 - 37 % of the territory resulted excellent for olive cultivation. In the analysis of spatial density, the area of Albania has two major hearths: the Ionian and Adriatic Hearth. In general, 21 genotypes resulted synonyms of 7 standard cv, whereas 21 genotypes resulted homonymous. PCA between correlation matrices of all variables, classified 16 unrelated variables explaining > 95 % of total variance. PCoA indexes eigevectors positioned genotypes and their characters according to their degree of variability in negative or positive space. (Axes, x, y and z) ...|$|E

In this chapter, {{the state of the art}} of somatic embryogenesis in chestnut (an important economical tree species of the genus Castanea) is assessed and discussed. The factors affecting the induction (type of explant, growth conditions, mineral media, plant growth regulators), maintenance and multiplication of the embryogenic cultures (through repetitive embryogenesis) and the maturation and conversion into plants of somatic embryos are described. The latest results achieved on the application of the process on both genetic transformation and cryoconservation of chestnut embryogenic lines are also mentioned. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the genetic structure of A. aculeata (macaw palm) groups by analyzing individual polymorphism of different ITS regions. Study Design: Experimental design study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Forest Engineering (Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri/MG) and <b>Germoplasm</b> Bank of macaw (Universidade Federal de Viçosa/MG), between February 2014 and December 2015. Methodology: DNA extracted from 42 leaf samples of Macaw palm. Five universal oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for different internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA of Macaw (ITS 1, ITS 2, ITS 3, ITS 4, and ITS 5) used for PCR amplification. Results: Of 42 analyzed samples, 20 resulted in reproducible bands for primers ITS 1 and ITS 2, 21 for ITS 3 and ITS 4, 24 for ITS 2 and ITS 5, and 22 for ITS 4 and ITS 5. Samples were grouped based on these results. Conclusion: Therefore, {{it was possible to}} identify genetic differences among Macaw progenies based on the quality of ITS sequences...|$|E
