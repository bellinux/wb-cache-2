5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> {{following}} the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Patton {{was elected}} Governor over Republican Larry Forgy. The major {{achievement}} {{of his first}} term was overhauling higher education, including making the state's community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected to the Republican Party, giving Republicans a majority in that legislative house {{for the first time}} ever. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton's first term success faded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and a dire economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated in 2002 when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky's campaign finance laws and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.|$|E
25|$|Flanders {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{continental}} European areas to undergo the Industrial Revolution, in the 19th century. Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846–50). After World War II, Antwerp and Ghent experienced a fast expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area. Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.|$|E

500|$|The United States economy went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in {{the early}} 1920s and {{automobile}} sales decreased. Coupled with increasing competition, Haynes Automobile Company began running into debt problems. Haynes had to use [...] his personal savings to rescue the company in 1921 and pay off some outstanding accounts. A bond drive was launched to raise $1million to help fund the company through the period, but it fell significantly short of raising enough money. Haynes [...] was the primary purchaser of the bonds. Unlike the other large auto companies like Ford and General Motors, Haynes Auto {{did not have the}} widespread dealership agreements that were able to sustain their companies through the hard times; his company relied on customer's ordering directly from the factory. Haynes Auto sales quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6,000 cars sold in 1922. In 1923 sales dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 in 1924. The situation continued to be bleak for the company, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in October 1924. Haynes sought a merger with multiple other auto companies, including Henry Ford, but partners were not forthcoming and Haynes was forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925. He was held personally responsible for about $95,000 of the company's debt. In addition, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the company and a substantial amount in investment bonds. In total, the loss cost Haynes an estimated quarter of his net worth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} sixties, {{the rate of}} {{economic}} growth slowed down significantly. [...] In 1962, the growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate petered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> with no growth in 1967. The economic showdown forced Erhard's resignation in 1966 and he was replaced with Kurt Georg Kiesinger of the CDU. Kiesinger was to attract much controversy because in 1933 he had joined the National Socialist Legal Guild and NSDAP (membership in the former was {{necessary in order to}} practice law, but membership in the latter was entirely voluntary).|$|E
2500|$|Roubini met {{officials}} in China during spring 2009, {{and pointed out}} that many Chinese commentators blame American [...] "overborrowing and excess" [...] for dragging them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> However, he stated that [...] "even they realize that the very excess of American demand has created a market for Chinese exports." [...] He adds that although Chinese leaders [...] "would love to be less dependent on American customers and hate having so many of their nation’s foreign assets tied up in U.S. dollars," [...] they’re now [...] "more worried about keeping Chinese exporters in business[...] [...] [...] I don’t think even the Chinese authorities have fully internalized the contradictions of their position." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} the Rambler American began with the Nash Rambler, {{introduced}} in 1950. AMC President George Mason believed in small cars, and had introduced the Austin built/Nash designed Metropolitan in 1954. The Rambler line grew to a larger size (108") in 1956. With costs to produce the Metropolitan rising, [...] AMC decided to reintroduce {{a modified version of}} the 1955 Nash Rambler (the last 100" [...] wheelbase model). The domestically produced replacement let AMC control costs more closely. New AMC president George Romney also wanted to build momentum in AMC's challenge to the domestic Big Three automakers by adding a third car line. The introduction of the new low priced sub compact Rambler was ideal—America had just entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in 1958 as the car was introduced.|$|E
2500|$|By 2004, {{these cuts}} had reduced federal tax revenues, as a {{percentage}} of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely we were headed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high. [...] The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the federal budget showed an annual surplus of more than US$230 billion. Under Bush, the government returned to deficit spending. The annual deficit reached an absolute record of US$374 billion in 2003 and then a further record of $413 billion in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} the Japanese {{automakers}} contributed to their American counterparts falling <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in the late 1970s. Unions and lobbyists in both North America and Europe put pressure on their government to restrict imports. In 1981, Japan agreed to Voluntary Export Restraints in order to preempt protectionism measures that the US may have taken, where it be tariffs or import quotas. Consequently, Japanese companies responded by investing heavily in US production facilities, as they were {{not subject to the}} VER. Unlike the plants of domestic automakers, Japanese plants are non-unionized (save for NUMMI), so they have lower wage expenses and do not face the risk of strikes. [...] The VER was lifted in 1994 upon agreement of all members of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). [...] Establishing US production facilities was also a significant step in improving public relations, along with philanthropy, lobbying efforts, and sharing technology. Europe has still largely maintained its protectionism policies against Japanese cars, though their varies considerably.|$|E
