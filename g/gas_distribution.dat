5|$|Following deregulation, the {{consumer}} has {{a choice of}} energy supplier. Electricity is provided by CE Electric UK, trading as NEDL. Natural gas was (and still is) supplied by British <b>Gas.</b> <b>Distribution</b> and, as with electricity, transmission, {{is the responsibility of}} the National Grid, having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by OFGEM.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} energy supplier for {{electricity and gas}} is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure {{is the presence of}} a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, wired to the local sub-grid.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of learning two-dimensional spatial models of <b>gas</b> <b>distributions.</b> To build models of <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> {{that can be used}} to accurately predict the gas concentration at query locations is a challenging task due to the chaotic nature of gas dispersal. We formulate this task as a regression problem. To deal with the specific properties of <b>gas</b> <b>distributions,</b> we propose a sparse Gaussian process mixture model, which allows us to accurately represent the smooth background signal and the areas with patches of high concentrations. We furthermore integrate the sparsification of the training data into an EM procedure that we apply for learning the mixture components and the gating function. Our approach has been implemented and tested using datasets recorded with a real mobile robot equipped with an electronic nose. The experiments demonstrate that our technique is well-suited for predicting gas concentrations at new query locations and that it outperforms alternative and previously proposed methods in robotics...|$|R

5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network is also now all-island, with a {{pipeline}} linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply {{is coming from}} the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{narrowly}} {{saved from}} discovery by the rioting construction workers, who storm {{the plant and}} along with him are besieged inside the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> centre, where they pump oxygen into the completed pressure dome to poison the ammonids, however some of the workers succumb to propaganda from the plant controllers, who offer them {{the chance to see}} inside the dome. The guards kill them by blocking the pipe with their bodies. In anger, the remaining workers fire on the dome with a bazooka, igniting the hydrogen and subsequently destroying the entire plant, killing the ammonids and releasing ammonia gas into the surrounding area.|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{constraints}} {{or driving}} forces that determine steady disk <b>gas</b> radial <b>distributions</b> are discussed, and observed <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> in late-type disks and correlations with disk rotation curves are analyzed. Evidence for quasi-steady states with radial gas flow is examined, and gas consumption rates and stellar density profiles are discussed, as are models of steady states with radial flows and more extreme 'driven' disks. The {{results indicate that}} the radial structure of a gas-rich disk can be simply and consistently accounted for as an azimuthally averaged hydrodynamic steady state in a fixed gravitational potential...|$|R
40|$|Upward {{inclined}} gas-liquid flows {{are frequently}} {{encountered in the}} oil industry and data relating to the local <b>gas</b> volume fraction <b>distribution</b> and the local <b>gas</b> velocity <b>distribution</b> is important, for example, in pressure gradient prediction and in modeling oil well 'blowouts'. In this paper measurements are presented of the local <b>gas</b> volume fraction <b>distribution</b> and the local axial <b>gas</b> velocity <b>distribution</b> which were taken in bubbly air-water flows in an 80 mm diameter pipe which was inclined at angles of 0 °, 15 ° and 30 ° to the vertical. Qualitative arguments are presented to explain the influence of the liquid superficial velocity on the local <b>gas</b> volume fraction <b>distribution</b> in inclined flow and also to explain the very high axial gas velocities observed towards the upper side of the inclined pipe...|$|R

40|$|We are {{studying}} the optical, radio, and X-ray morphologies of interacting galaxies in which at least one member is also an active galaxy. Deformed <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> are seen in galaxies that also show optical evidence of tidal deformation, indicating significant gas redistribution in these interacting systems, thereby providing compelling evidence for a causal connection between tidal and nuclear activity in "interactive" galaxies...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} baryonic {{component of}} galaxy clusters is hot <b>gas</b> whose <b>distribution</b> is commonly probed through X-ray emission arising from thermal bremsstrahlung. The density profile thus obtained has been traditionally modeled with a beta-profile, a simple function {{with only three}} parameters. However, this model {{is known to be}} insufficient for characterizing the range of cluster <b>gas</b> <b>distributions,</b> and attempts to rectify this shortcoming typically introduce additional parameters to increase the fitting flexibility. We use cosmological and physical considerations to obtain a family of profiles for the gas with fewer parameters than the beta-model but which better accounts for observed gas profiles over wide radial intervals.

25|$|Natural gas {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the United States in 1626, when the French explorers found Native Americans setting gas on fire that leaked into Lake Erie. In 1816, the U.S. first lighted the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. Then in 1821, the first successful natural gas well was dug in Fredonia, New York, which allowed for the American natural <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> company to be built there in 1858. And then in 1836, the first city-owned natural <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> company was created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While during the 1800s, natural gas was used mainly for lighting streets and homes, the creation of pipelines in the 1900s allowed for extensive use of it in home appliances, manufacturing plants, and boilers.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen piping can {{in theory}} be avoided in {{distributed}} systems of hydrogen production, where hydrogen is routinely made on site using medium or small-sized generators which would produce enough hydrogen {{for personal use}} or perhaps a neighborhood.

We present new N- 2 /O- 2 measurements that markedly differ from previous {{measurements of the}} Dye- 3 ice core: the N- 2 /O- 2 ratio we observe is much closer to atmospheric. This has new implications for the interpretation of <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> in ice sheets and the reconstruction of past atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|We perform {{simulations}} {{for future}} Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observations of RX J 1713. 7 − 3946, a young supernova remnant (SNR) {{and one of}} the brightest sources ever discovered in very high energy (VHE) gamma rays. Special attention is paid to exploring possible spatial (anti) correlations of gamma rays with emission at other wavelengths, in particular X-rays and CO/H i emission. We present a series of simulated images of RX J 1713. 7 − 3946 for CTA based on a set of observationally motivated models for the gamma-ray emission. In these models, VHE gamma rays produced by high-energy electrons are assumed to trace the nonthermal X-ray emission observed by XMM-Newton, whereas those originating from relativistic protons delineate the local <b>gas</b> <b>distributions.</b> The local atomic and molecular <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> are deduced by the NANTEN team from CO and H i observations. Our primary goal is to show how one can distinguish the emission mechanism(s) of the gamma rays (i. e., hadronic versus leptonic, or a mixture of the two) through information provided by their spatial distribution, spectra, and time variation. This work is the first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the capabilities of CTA to achieve various proposed scientific goals by observing this important cosmic particle accelerator...|$|R

25|$|Gas pipes {{were first}} {{laid in the}} late 19th century, and gas stoves started to replace the older {{coal-fired}} stoves. Gas was more expensive than coal, though, and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealthier homes.

30|$|To {{determine}} appropriate {{gas control}} strategies and design optimal drainage boreholes, {{it is essential}} to understand the gas flow mechanisms and <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> in the goaf and the ventilation system. Gas flows in the LW goaf are complex and contain multiple components including methane, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, etc. These different components may come from different sources such as various overlying and underlying coal seams, gas bearing strata units, and worked goafs. Mining induced gas flows are a combined consequence of geomechanical changes and associated gas reservoir condition changes, mine ventilation, and gas drainage.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} ram-pressure effects by an intracluster wind on {{an inner}} disk of spiral galaxies by a hydrodynamical simulation. Even {{if the wind}} is mild and {{not strong enough to}} strip the gas disk, the ram pressure disturbs orbits of the inter-arm gas significantly. This results in asymmetric dense molecular arms in the inner few kpc region of a galaxy. This mechanism would explain the asymmetric CO <b>gas</b> <b>distributions</b> in the central regions often observed in Virgo spirals. Comment: To appear in PASJ. 7 pages, 3 gif figure...|$|R

25|$|In {{the rest}} of the world, natural gas is sold in {{gigajoule}} retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) are traded in metric tons or MMBTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> contracts are signed in cubic metres, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes (1,000kg). The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships, as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures.

25|$|Once Alberta's Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board began {{operating}} in 1938, the BA and Gas and Oil Products Limited plants {{had to change}} their operations significantly. Only Royalite had a market for its residue of gas stripped of liquids in the Canadian Western Natural <b>Gas</b> <b>distribution</b> system. The other two plants flared or burned off most of their residue gas until the board ruled that only wells connected to a market could be produced, stopping the practice. Since the rule applied only to wells that tapped the oil reservoir's overlying gas cap, the Hartell and Longview plants stayed in operation by processing solution gas, or gas dissolved in oil from the Valley's wells.|$|E
