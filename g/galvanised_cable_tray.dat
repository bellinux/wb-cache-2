40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>trays</b> {{are used}} in {{industry}} to order cable runs in distributed systems. With little extra effort, <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> can also be exploited to harden cables against external electromagnetic interference. Some recommendations in this regard are found both in literature and in standards. We critically examine the importance of <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> end-connections to enclosures {{as well as their}} midspan connections. Emphasis is placed on visualizing common-mode currents and magnetic fields, which have bearing on the best type of connection to be used. Results are derived from computational electromagnetic analysis and network analyzer measurements on two models in a screened room. From this study, it is possible to give clear recommendations on best connection practice. © 2011 IEEE. Articl...|$|R

5000|$|Each {{of these}} test {{procedures}} have very similar fire endurance regimes and heat transfer limitations. Differences include the hose-stream tests, which {{are unique to}} Canada and the United States, whereas Germany includes a very rigorous impact test during the fire for firewalls. Germany is unique in including heat induced expansion and collapse of ferrous <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> into account for firestops, resulting in the favouring of firestop mortars, which tend to hold the penetrating <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> in place, whereas [...] "softseals", typically made of rockwool and elastomeric toppings, have been demonstrated in testing by Otto Graf institute to be torn open and rendered inoperable when the <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> expands, pushes in and then collapses. Spin-offs from these basic tests cover closures, firestops and more. Furnace operations, thermocoupling and reporting requirements remain uniform within each country.|$|R
50|$|Cables can be {{securely}} fastened and organized, such as by using trunking, <b>cable</b> <b>trays,</b> <b>cable</b> ties or cable lacing. Continuous-flex or flexible cables used in moving applications within cable carriers can be secured using strain relief devices or cable ties.|$|R

They are especially useful in situations where changes to a wiring system are anticipated, since new cables can be installed by laying them in the tray, instead of pulling them through a pipe.|$|R

40|$|Sections of the Space Shuttle External Tank Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) and Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> are {{shielded}} from potentially damaging airloads with foam Protuberance Aerodynamic Load (PAL) Ramps. Flight standard design LO 2 and LH 2 <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> sections were tested {{with and without}} PAL Ramp models in the United States Air Force Arnold Engineering Development Center s (AEDC) 16 T transonic wind tunnel to obtain experimental data on the aeroelastic stability and response characteristics of the trays {{and as part of}} the larger effort to determine whether the PAL ramps can be safely modified or removed. Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations of the full-stack shuttle launch configuration were used to investigate the flow characeristics around and under the <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> without the protective PAL ramps and to define maximum crossflow Mach numbers and dynamic pressures experienced during launch. These crossflow conditions were used to establish wind tunnel test conditions which also included conservative margins. For all of the conditions and configurations tested, no aeroelastic instabilities or unacceptable dynamic response levels were encountered and no visible structural damage was experienced by any of the tested <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> sections. Based upon this aeroelastic characterization test, three potentially acceptable alternatives are available for the LO 2 <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> PAL Ramps: Mini-Ramps, Tray Fences, or No Ramps. All configurations were tested to maximum conditions, except the LH 2 trays at - 15 deg. crossflow angle. This exception is the only caveat preventing the proposal of acceptable alternative configurations for the LH 2 trays as well. Structural assessment of all tray loads and tray response measurements from launches following the Shuttle Return To Flight with the existing PAL Ramps will determine the acceptability of these PAL Ramp alternatives...|$|R

5000|$|Ferrous <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> expand {{with the}} {{increasing}} heat from accidental fire. This has been proven by the German Otto-Graf-Institut Test Report III.1-80999/Tei/tei [...] "Supplementary Test On The Topic Of Mechanical Force Acting On Cable Penetration Firestop Systems During The Fire Test", dated 23 October 1984, to dislodge [...] "soft" [...] firestops, such as those made of fibrous insulations with rubber coatings. This also applies to any silicone foam seals, but is easily remedied {{through the use of}} firestop mortars of sufficient compression strength and thickness, as shown above. Also, some building codes mandate that penetrants such as <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> are installed in such ways so as to avoid their contribution to the collapse of a firewall.|$|R
