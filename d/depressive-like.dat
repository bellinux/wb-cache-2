50|$|Chronic mild stress: The chronic mild stress (CMS) {{model is}} {{probably}} the most valid animal model of depression. It aims to model a chronic <b>depressive-like</b> state that develops gradually over time in response to stress, and they can provide more natural induction. CMS involves the exposure of animals to a series of mild and unpredictable stressors (periods of food and water deprivation, small temperature reductions, changes of cage mates, and other similar individually innocuous manipulations) during at least 2 weeks. The model has been reported to result in long lasting changes of behavioral, neurochemical, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrinological variables resembling reward functions including decreased intracranial self-stimulation, reflecting anhedonia that is reversed by chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment.|$|E

5000|$|Early life {{experiences}} {{and environmental factors}} may lead to epigenetic modification at specific gene loci, leading to altered neuronal plasticity, function, and subsequent behavior. Chromatin remodeling in rodent offspring and altered gene expression within the limbic brain regions that may contribute to depression, stress, and anxiety-related disorders in future generations. Variations in maternal care, such as maternal licking and grooming, indicates reduced HPA axis reactivity in subsequent generations. Such HPA axis modifications lead to decreased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood and increased glucocorticoid receptor levels leading to negative feedback on HPA reactivity and further behavioral modifications. Rodent models of maternal separation also reveal increased <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in offspring, decreased stress coping abilities, and changes in DNA methylation.|$|E
50|$|When mice {{are exposed}} to {{unpredictable}} chronic mild stress (UCMS), they start exhibiting symptoms reminiscent of major depressive disorder in humans. As it had been suggested that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis might underlie depression, Crusio and collaborators undertook a series of experiments investigating changes in behavior and neurogenesis in mice that had undergone UCMS. They showed dramatic changes in levels of aggression, anxiety, <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors, and learning, with a concomitant drop in neurogenesis. However, the results were strain- and sex-specific and there {{did not appear to}} be a clear-cut correlation between the different changes, so that they finally concluded that although their data do not disprove the idea that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis solely underlie the behavioral impairments observed in human psychiatric disorders such as depression, they do not provide support for this hypothesis either.|$|E
50|$|GABA ergic {{hypothesis}} {{for depression}} has been proposed. This hypothesis places the GABA {{system in a}} central role in the pathophysiology of depression and in addition to that clinical studies have shown that alprazolam and adinazolam have antidepressant activities in patients with major depressive disorder. Unfortunately we do not know which receptor subtype is responsible for the antidepressant activities. Studies in y2 knockout mice have shown that they display increased anxiety and <b>depressive-like</b> symptoms in despair based tests. The mice also had increased corticosterone concentration which is a symptom in major depression in humans. The y2 subunit is associated with α1-α6 subunits, which are all known α subunits, so these studies do not show which of the α subunits are related to the depressive like symptoms. Other studies with α2 knockout mice have displayed increased anxiety and depression-like symptoms in conflict based feeding tests and the fact that anxiety and depression are often linked seems to indicate that the α2 subunit might be a valid target for a GABAA antidepressant.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that fear can contribute to behavioral changes. One way this phenomenon has been studied is {{on the basis of}} the repeated stress model done by Camp RM et al.(among others). In this particular study, it was examined that the contribution fear conditioning may play a huge role in altering an animal's (Fischer rat's) behavior in a repeated stress paradigm. Behavioral changes that are commonly referred to as <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors resulted from this model of testing. After setting a control and a valid experimental design, Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment. After four days of stressor exposure, both exploratory behavior and social interaction were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment. The rats showed much decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in different contexts compared to control rats. To further make a correlation to the biochemistry (as mentioned below), chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure thus halting long term potentiation. Some physiological changes also occurred including the decrease in body weight gain and adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. Overall, the conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a repeated stress paradigm. This can be extended to correlate to other animals as well but with varying degrees of responses.|$|E
50|$|McClung et al. {{discuss the}} gene {{expression}} profiles of previously mentioned CREB and ΔFosB {{as they are}} involved in cocaine use. These transcription factors have been shown {{to play a role in}} the short-term and long-term adaptive changes in the brain. CREB has been implicated in learning, memory, and depression and enriched in cocaine users within the nucleus accumbens. CREB seems to upregulate many genes in its pathway within the reward regions of the brain and seems to reduce the rewarding effects of cocaine and leads to <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors instead. The gene expression changes by CREB are induced by short-term cocaine treatment and eventually go back to normal. They also focused on ΔFosB, which is in the family of FosB proteins. While most of these proteins have been implicated in short-term abuse gene expression changes, McClung et al. demonstrated that ΔFosB gene expression changes in the NAc were induced by short-term and long-term cocaine exposure. Short-term cocaine exposure lead to the same expression profiles of upregulated genes as CREB did creating the reduced rewarding effects seen. However, long-term exposure lead to a different expression profile leading to increased rewarding effects. They suggested that ΔFosB acts as a repressor and somehow interacts with the CREB pathway and indirectly leads to the same short-term effects seen, but over time, acts to upregulate genes within its own pathway leading to the increased rewarding effects. It is unknown how these two pathways interact, but they have shown that there is some overlap.|$|E
50|$|Through {{activation}} of the KOR, dynorphins, opioid peptides that are the endogenous ligands of the KOR and that can, in many regards, be figuratively thought of as functional inverses of the morphine-like, euphoric and stress-inhibiting endorphins, induce dysphoria and stress-like responses in both animals and humans, as well as psychotomimetic effects in humans, and {{are thought to be}} essential for the mediation of the dysphoric aspects of stress. In addition, dynorphins are believed to be critically involved in producing the changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that lead to the development of depressive and anxiety disorders, increased drug-seeking behavior, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In support of this, in knockout mice lacking the genes encoding the KOR and/or prodynorphin (the endogenous precursor of the dynorphins), many of the usual effects of exposure to chronic stress are completely absent, such as increased immobility in the forced swimming test (a widely employed assay of <b>depressive-like</b> behavior) and increased conditioned place preference for cocaine (a measure of the rewarding properties and addictive susceptibility to cocaine). Accordingly, KOR antagonists show robust efficacy in animal models of depression, anxiety, anhedonia, drug addiction, and other stress-related behavioral and physiological abnormalities. As such, there has been great interest in developing KOR antagonists for the treatment of these and other psychiatric conditions in humans. Progress has been limited until recently however, due to difficulty in finding selective KOR antagonists with suitable drug profiles (e.g., good pharmacokinetic parameters, short-acting (non-"inactivating") KOR inhibition, lack of toxicity, etc.) for clinical development and use in humans.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, Kieffer {{succeeded in}} [...] "first to clone and isolate {{the gene for}} an opioid {{receptor}} in the brain that {{plays a key role}} in alleviating pain, a puzzle which scientists around the world had been attempting to solve for the previous fifteen years. Her findings led the way to new treatments for fighting pain, addiction and depression". The gene she isolated encoded for an opioid receptor that can reduce pain, generate pleasure, and help cope with stress. The receptors can be activated by drugs, which can cause addictions. Better knowledge of the way that these receptors function can help scientists understand addictions, mood disorders, and mental illness. [...] “Mental illnesses are biological illnesses. The brain is an organ, certainly a highly complex and fascinating one, but like every other organ in the human body, it can be treated. - Brigitte Kieffer Her research discoveries have led to development of new analgesic medicines and new treatments for addiction. Opioid system disorders are involved in emotional problems such as anxiety and severe depression. Her research involves many studies regarding opiate addiction. In mice she has researched how the effects of heroin withdrawal can yield depressive behaviors. Her research has shown that after periods of heroin exposure, once mice become abstinent they exhibit <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors that persist weeks after heroin exposure was halted. This information helps explain the severity and chronicity of addiction in certain individuals. Dr. Kieffer's research also deals with how findings can be translated to humans. Study of brain opioid receptors that deal with depression and happiness are often a focus of her research. In many post-mortem studies of suicide victims it was discovered that mu (µ) opioid receptors (MOR) are present in higher density of the frontal and temporal cortex of the human brain when compared with controls of post-mortem studies of patients with no history of psychiatric disorder. This suggests that depression and suicide may be associated with higher MOR density. She tested this theory of MOR association with depressive behavior and the results in mice lead to the conclusion that MOR and depressive behavior are indeed related to one another.|$|E
40|$|Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} psychological diseases to threaten human health. “Cytokine theory of depression” suggests that cytokines may play an important role in depression, which provided a new perspective in the study the mechanism and the therapy of depressive symptoms. This view is supported by various findings. Administration of pro-inflammatory cytokine or lipoposaccharide in animal induces <b>depressive-like</b> behavior such as anhedonia and low locomotion, which is very similar to the behavioral symptoms of depression in humans. However, the earlier researches may only pay attention to the short-time behavior effects; the effects of long-time behavior changes have not been clearly reported. In addition, there are few reports about the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine or anti-inflammatory cytokine on the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by chronic stressors. To further understand the role of cytokines in depression, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the dose and time effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by lipoposaccharide on <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, sensitization effect of pro-inflammatory and blockage effect of anti-inflammatory on <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by chronic cold swimming stress. The behavioral observation was carried out using sacharin preference test, open field test and elevated-plus maze. The results indicated that: 1) The activated immunity induced by LPS i. p administration could induce significant <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, but these behaviors had no long-term effect; 2) The <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors induced by stress could be elicited earlier and kept longer by the activated immunity induced by LPS ip; 4) The chronic activated immunity induced by LPS icv administration could provoke significant <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, and the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors induced by stress could be enhanced by icv LPS, LPS and stress had certain interact-sensitization effect on <b>depressive-like</b> behavior； 5) Anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 10 icv reversed the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors induced by the stress. In conclusion, cytokines play an important role in the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Both peripheral and central administration of LPS induced a certain <b>depressive-like</b> behavior and enhanced stress-induced depressive behavior. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 icv could reverse the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors induced by the stress.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that stress causes {{a decrease of}} neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and antidepressant treatment in turn stimulates the cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus.

The article reviews the relationship of <b>depressive-like</b> behavior and neurogenesis in three animal models of depression with high validity: learned helplessness, chronic mild stress and chronic psychosocial stress of the tree shrew. All animal models provide evidence that stress which can lead to <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, in parallel causes a decrease of neurogenesis; vice versa, antidepressant treatment is able to revert not only behavioral changes but also to normalize neurogenesis. But the animal models argue against the notion that decreases of neurogenesis are the cause or the consequence of <b>depressive-like</b> behavior since <b>depressive-like</b> behavior can occur without impairments in neurogenesis and decreasing neurogenesis does not neccessarily lead to <b>depressive-like</b> behavior.

40|$|Although {{increasing}} evidence demonstrates that both chronic stressors and inflammatory immune activation contribute to pathophysiology and behavioral alterations associated with major depression, {{little is known}} about the interaction effect of central inflammatory immune activation and stress on depressivelike behavior. Our previous work has shown that 14 -day chronic forced swim stress induces significant <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. The present investigation assessed whether pro-inflammatory cytokine and anti-inflammatory cytokine challenges have differential interaction effect on <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by chronic forced swim stress in rats. The pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune challenges were achieved respectively by central administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a proinflammatory cytokine inducer, and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. It was found that either central LPS treatment alone or chronic forced swim stress alone significantly induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, including reduced body weight gain, reduced saccharin preference and reduced locomotor activity. However, there was no significant synergistic or additive effect of central LPS treatment and stress on <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. LPS treatment did not exacerbate the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by forced swim stress. Nevertheless, IL- 10 reversed <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by forced swim stress, a finding indicating that IL- 10 has antidepressant effect on behavioral depression induced by stress.

LPS 0. 8 mg/kg, ip, significantly induced sickness signs such as weight loss, decrease of water and food intake and <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in the tail suspension test. Nortriptyline (ip, 60 min prior the test) reversed the LPS-induced depressive states.

Systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is commonly used to study inflammation-associated behavioral changes in rodents.

We report that systemic administration of LPS induced astrocyte activation in transgenic GFAP-luc mice and increased immunoreactivity against the microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 in the dentate gyrus of wild-type mice.

It is critical to improve abnormal metabolic status as well as <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors in patients with long-term glucocorticoid therapy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors and metabolic abnormalities induced by chronic corticosterone injection. Male ICR mice were administrated corticosterone (40 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection for three weeks. Resveratrol (50 and 100 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) were given by oral gavage 30 min prior to corticosterone administration. The behavioral tests showed that resveratrol significantly reversed the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors induced by corticosterone, including the reduced sucrose preference and increased immobility time in the forced swimming test. Moreover, resveratrol also increased the secretion of insulin, reduced serum level of glucose and improved blood lipid profiles in corticosterone-treated mice without affecting normal mice. However, fluoxetine only reverse <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors, and pioglitazone only prevent the dyslipidemia induced by corticosterone. Furthermore, resveratrol and pioglitazone decreased serum level of glucagon and corticosterone.

40|$|Background : Inflammation {{associated}} with cancer and induced by cancer therapy is {{associated with}} clinical signs of sickness behavior that can culminate {{in the development of}} symptoms of depression. Intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide to mice induces <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Lipopolysaccharide-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior is mediated by activation of indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) that degrades tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway and produces kynurenine metabolites such as quinolinic acid that acts as a N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist. The present study was carried out to determine whether the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Methods : Mice were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine or saline immediately before administration of the cytokine inducer lipopolysaccharide or saline via the same route. Their behavior and bodyweight were monitored up to 28 h post-injection. <b>Depressive-like</b> behavior was measured by increased immobility in the forced swim test and decreased sucrose preference for a sucrose solution. Brain, liver and plasma were collected 6 h and 28 h after treatment to measure biomarkers of inflammation. Results : Lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of cytokine, IDO, tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) and heme oxygenase- 1 at the periphery and in the brain. This effect was not altered by ketamine pretreatment. Ketamine blocked the development of <b>depressive-like</b> behavior but had no effect on sickness behavior measured by body weight loss, reduced food intake and decreased motor activity. Conclusions : These data indicate that ketamine is able to abrogate inflammation-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior by antagonising the activating effects of kynurenine metabolites on NMDA receptors...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAgmatine {{has been}} {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} novel candidate to assist the conventional pharmacotherapy of depression. The acute restraint stress (ARS) is an unavoidable stress situation that may cause <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in rodents. In this study, we investigated the potential antidepressant-like effect of agmatine (10 mg/kg, administered acutely by oral route) in the forced swimming test (FST) in non-stressed mice, {{as well as its}} ability to abolish the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior and hippocampal antioxidant imbalance induced by ARS. Agmatine reduced the immobility time in the mouse FST (1 – 100 mg/kg) in non-stressed mice. ARS caused an increase in the immobility time in the FST, indicative of a <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, as well as hippocampal lipid peroxidation, and an increase in the activity of hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, reduced catalase (CAT) activity and increased SOD/CAT ratio, an index of pro-oxidative conditions. Agmatine was effective to abolish the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by ARS and to prevent the ARS-induced lipid peroxidation and changes in SOD, GR and CAT activities and in SOD/CAT activity ratio. Hippocampal levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not altered by any experimental condition. In conclusion, the present study shows that agmatine was able to abrogate the ARS-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior and the associated redox hippocampal imbalance observed in stressed restraint mice, suggesting that its antidepressant-like effect may be dependent on its ability to maintain the pro-/anti-oxidative homeostasis in the hippocampus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCircadian rhythm {{disruptions}} {{are often}} observed in depressed patients, {{and changes in}} the light/dark cycle promote <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in animal models. Prolonged exposure to constant light (LL) is known to lead to arrhythmicity of circadian locomotor activity and <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in rats. Interestingly, neonatal exposure to LL prevents both arrhythmicity and depressive behavior in adulthood. Arrhythmic rats under LL conditions that cohabitate with a rhythmic rat exhibit improvement in circadian rhythms. We tested whether such cohabitation also protects against LL-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Wistar rats were assigned to conditions of either neonatal constant light (neonatal-LL) on postnatal days 10 – 22 or a regular light/dark cycle (neonatal-LD). On day 45, the animals were assigned to three possible pair combinations. After a baseline sucrose preference test, half of the pairs were placed under LL conditions. Weekly sucrose preference tests were conducted to evaluate <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. The animals were isolated by an aluminum wall on the test day. At week 2 of LL, sucrose preference was reduced in neonatal-LD/neonatal-LD pairs of animals. At week 5, neonatal-LD/neonatal-LD pairs exhibited anhedonic-like behavior, but the pairs with at least one neonatal-LL rat did not. The LL cycle was returned to an LD cycle, and the neonatal-LD/neonatal-LD pairs exhibited a restoration of sucrose preference 2 weeks later. We conclude that social interaction can prevent <b>depressive-like</b> behavior induced by circadian rhythm disruption as long as one of the animals is more prone to present a strong rhythm...|$|E
30|$|In the FST, {{the time}} of immobility, {{indicating}} a <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, was higher in the CLP group compared with the control group on day 10, which is compatible with previous reports that used the CLP model. Two previous studies reported {{a significant increase in}} the immobility time in the CLP group compared with the sham group, 10  days after CLP procedure [5, 15]. In addition, a recent study that used a sucrose consumption test as a <b>depressive-like</b> state model reported that CLP induction caused anhedonia with the reduced sucrose intake compared with the sham group, 17  days after surgery [17]. We found no differences in {{the time of}} immobility between the groups on day 30 and 60 meaning that <b>depressive-like</b> state was resolved before 30  days in the CLP group. In a previous study, the CLP group was shown to have increased immobility time compared with the sham group on day 10 and day 30, but not on day 60 [8]. We showed that both IgG and IgGAM treatments decreased immobility time compared with the CLP group on day 10, which can be interpreted that both treatments reversed CLP-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors by day 10.|$|E
40|$|Depression is {{frequently}} associated with inflammation. Animal {{studies have shown}} that peripheral inflammation induces <b>depressive-like</b> behaviour, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A distinction between sickness- and <b>depressive-like</b> behaviour has been proposed. We hypothesize that the behavioural distinction is due to changes in the central production of immune mediators. As a model of peripheral inflammation, we administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally daily for 4 days in rats. The effect of LPS on sickness- and <b>depressive-like</b> behaviour was assessed. We examined protein levels and mRNA expression of cytokines and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and specific brain regions. Two hours post-LPS, the rats displayed sickness behaviour and cytokine levels were elevated in both serum and CSF. This was paralleled by specific alterations of mRNA transcription of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Twenty-four hours post-LPS the rats showed <b>depressive-like</b> behaviour and peripheral cytokine levels were back close to baseline. In contrast, the central transcription of IL- 1 β mRNA had increased even further, as well as IL- 1 β CSF levels. IL- 6 and TNF-α transcription was unaltered compared to controls. COX enzymes were downregulated in the hippocampus during sickness behaviour and unaltered during <b>depressive-like</b> behaviour. Our results show {{for the first time that}} a peripheral immune challenge induces a region specific transcription of cytokines and COX-enzymes in the brain, at time-points corresponding to behavioural sickness and depression. When the peripheral inflammation and sickness behaviour had ceased, a production of proinflammatory cytokines remained within the brain parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for over 60 years that social {{isolation}} of children and the young of some non-human primate species elicits agitated vocalizing and other active behavior, which eventually segues into a second, passive stage of <b>depressive-like</b> responding. How this transition occurs remains obscure. A leading hypothesis proposes that continued activation of the neural substrates underlying the vocalization response drives the onset of the passive stage. Guinea pigs also exhibit a 2 -stage, active/passive response during isolation, and much of the identification of neural structures underlying the separation vocalization was based on studies of electrical brain stimulation in guinea pigs. We, therefore, asked whether repeated electrical stimulation of brain sites subserving the isolation vocalization would increase later <b>depressive-like</b> responding in guinea pigs. In Experiments 1 and 2, female guinea pigs with stimulating electrodes placed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and periaqueductal gray, respectively, were tested over 10 daily, 30 -min trials. Stimulation of either site produced elevated levels of vocalizing, which diminished over repeated isolation trials. However, there was no increase in <b>depressive-like</b> responding either before or after subsequent trials, or during probe trials in which no stimulation was administered. In Experiment 3, stimulation of the BNST increased vocalizing during the first 30 -min of the 3 -h isolation period, but produced no increase in <b>depressive-like</b> behavior during the remainder of the trial. In sum, continued activation of brain sites underlying isolation vocalizations was not sufficient, in and of itself, to induce later <b>depressive-like</b> responding...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in {{psychiatric}} disorders {{has been the}} focus of great research attention in recent years. Paradoxically, the same is not true for anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we assessed the behavioral profile of animals with altered expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. We performed a battery of tests to assess anxiety, <b>depressive-like</b> and cognitive behaviors in mice overexpressing IL- 10 (PMT 10) and IL- 10 (-/-) animals; in the later mice we also tested the behavioral effect of IL- 10 administration. In the forced-swimming test, IL- 10 (-/-) females displayed increased <b>depressive-like</b> behavior; importantly, this phenotype was reverted by the injection of IL- 10. Moreover, mice overexpressing IL- 10 presented a decreased <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Despite the presence of a similar trend, male animals did not reach significant differences in <b>depressive-like</b> behavior. Assessment in the open-field showed that the absence of IL- 10 decreased the percentage of time spent in the center of the arena in both male and female mice, while male animals overexpressing IL- 10 revealed an opposite behavior. For both sexes, imbalance in IL- 10 levels did not affect spatial reference memory. In conclusion, variations in IL- 10 expression are associated with an altered <b>depressive-like</b> behavior, but do not influence cognitive performance. Interestingly, IL- 10 imbalance produced more profound behavioral changes in females than in male animals. This is in accordance with clinical data demonstrating an increased susceptibility of women to mood disorders, suggesting an interplay between anti-inflammatory cytokines and sexual steroids...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the intimate relationship between depression and immune disturbances. Aware of the efficacy limits of existing antidepressant drugs and the potential anti-inflammatory properties of propentofylline, we sought {{to evaluate the use}} of propentofylline as a depression treatment. We used a rat model of depression induced by repetitive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administrations. We have studied sickness behavior, by assessing daily body weight, open field behavior, and TNF-α plasmatic levels. Anxiety-like behavior (light-dark test), <b>depressive-like</b> behavior (forced swim test), plasmatic levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, depression biomarker), and central glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (an astrocyte biomarker) were also evaluated. LPS induced body weight loss, open field behavior impairments (decreased locomotion and rearing, and increased immobility), and increased TNF-α levels in rats, compared with control group. Thus, LPS induced sickness behavior. LPS also increased the immobility and reduced climbing in the forced swim test, when compared with the control group, i. e., LPS induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in rats. Propentofylline prevented sickness behavior after four days of consecutive treatment, as well as prevented the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior after five days of consecutive treatments. Propentofylline also prevented the increase in GFAP expression induced by LPS. Neither LPS nor propentofylline has influenced the anxiety and BDNF levels of rats. In conclusion, repetitive LPS administrations induced sickness behavior and <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in rats. Propentofylline prevented both sickness behavior and <b>depressive-like</b> behavior via neuroinflammatory pathway. The present findings may contribute to a better understanding and treatment of depression and associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{clinical}} trails {{reported that}} adjunctive cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 inhibition with celecoxib is beneficial in treating depression. However, another clinical study showed celecoxib {{did not have}} inhibitory effect of COX- 2 in human brain when given at a therapeutic dose. Therefore, whether celecoxib is exerting its influence through COX inhibition or by some other mechanism remains unclear. The present study further investigated the effect of celecoxib on COX- 2 expression, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2, a major COX- 2 -mediated inflammatory mediator) concentration and the <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors in rats. Celecoxib was administrated by oral gavage to naive rats (16 mg/kg) or stressed rats (2, 8, 16 mg/kg, respectively) for 21 days, or to stressed rats for a single dose (16 mg/kg). The results showed that 21 days chronic unpredictable stress induced <b>depressive-like</b> behaviors and increased the COX- 2 expression and PGE 2 concentration in rat brain. Chronic treatments with celecoxib alleviated the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior and reversed the levels of COX- 2 expression and PGE 2 concentration in stressed rat in a dose-dependent manner. Celecoxib also improved the emotional state and decreased COX- 2 expression and PGE 2 concentration in naive rats. In addition, a single dose of celecoxib treatment reversed COX- 2 expression and PGE 2 concentration, but didn't alter the <b>depressive-like</b> behavior in stressed rat. These results suggest that COX- 2 enzyme might {{play a key role}} in pathophysiology of depression. Furthermore, these data indicate that chronic celecoxib treatment reverse chronic unpredictable stress-induced <b>depressive-like</b> behavior might via reducing COX- 2 enzyme in brain, and the selective COX- 2 inhibitors could be developed as potential remedies for the management of depression.
