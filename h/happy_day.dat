25|$|H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading {{firm that}} {{operated}} from Apia, Samoa, caused controversy when it threatened {{to seize the}} entire island of Vaitupu unless a debt of $13,000 was repaid. The debt {{was the result of}} the failed operations of the Vaitupu Company, which had been established by Thomas William Williams, with part of the debt relating to the attempts to operate the trading schooner Vaitupulemele. The Vaitupuans continue to celebrate Te Aso Fiafia (<b>Happy</b> <b>Day)</b> on 25 November of each year.

25|$|Vaitupuans {{celebrate}} Te Aso Fiafia (<b>Happy</b> <b>Day)</b> on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 {{which was}} the date on which the final instalment of a debt of $13,000 was repaid to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, Samoa. Vaitupu history is that Thomas William Williams, the Ruge agent, pretended to do his customers a favour {{by allowing them to}} obtain goods on credit. In 1883 the debt of the Vaitupuans was $13,000 and H. M. Ruge and Company had threatened to seize the entire island unless the debt was repaid. Neemia, a Vaitupuan pastor living in Samoa, returned and organised working parties to collect coconuts and prepare copra to sell to pay off the debt, with Henry Nitz, the Webber & Co agent on Vaitupu, contributing money to meet the final payment. The Vaitupuans, with the help of their friends from Funafuti, repaid the debt by the due date. Seven thousand dollars was repaid by 1886 and the balance was paid on 25 November 1887.|$|E

Here he ran a coffee shop, whereas in <b>Happy</b> <b>Days,</b> he owned the diner. Morita would re-join the cast of <b>Happy</b> <b>Days</b> five years later, while his replacement on that series, Al Molinaro, would repeat Morita's career move at that time by joining another <b>Happy</b> <b>Days</b> spin-off, Joanie Loves Chachi.|$|R

Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, feeling as if she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take a picture with him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll see them. At the wedding, Roxy begins to break down and says she cannot give Ronnie away and runs out. Ronnie is unable to face Jack and runs off in tears, later revealing she wishes Roxy to move with them and will not accept any other outcome. Jack eventually accepts and they marry after Roxy gives her away. Later, the two sisters get drunk after a <b>happy</b> <b>day</b> and wander outside the hotel; precariously perched on the hotel roof, still drinking champagne, they discuss their time in the square and the start of a new era. Ronnie and Roxy find the hotel swimming pool, and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is unable to remove her wedding dress and sees Roxy motionless at the bottom of the pool. Ronnie jumps in to rescue her, but is weighed down by her wedding dress and drowns alongside her sister. The following morning, police find their bodies in the pool and inform Jack's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood), who then breaks the news to a devastated Jack. A few days later, Jack receives their wedding video and watches Ronnie saying how much she loves him, and is emotional watching it. Jack later visits her body in the chapel of rest a day before her and Roxy's funerals and says an emotional farewell to her.

500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, but obviously a <b>happy</b> <b>day</b> for me because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other."

500|$|Walpole {{returned}} to Petrograd in February 1916. He moved into Somov's flat, and his Anglo-Russian Propaganda Bureau began work. The following month {{he suffered a}} personal blow: he recorded in his diary for 13 March 1916, [...] "Thirty two to-day! Should have been a <b>happy</b> <b>day</b> but was completely clouded for me by reading in the papers of Henry James' death. This was a terrible shock to me." [...] Walpole remained at the bureau {{for the rest of}} 1916 and most of 1917, witnessing the February Revolution. He wrote an official report on events for the Foreign Office, and also absorbed ideas for his fiction. In addition to the first of his popular [...] "Jeremy" [...] novels, written in his spare time from the bureau, he began work on the second of his Russian-themed books, The Secret City. Sadleir writes that this novel and The Dark Forest [...] "take a high place among his works, on account of their intuitive understanding of an alien mentality and the vigour of their narrative power." [...] The book won the inaugural James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} official synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Tom Wilk is a poor country lad, living alone with his stepfather, who ill-treats him. Tom leaves his work one day to follow a circus parade. He is fascinated with {{the wonders of the}} parade and follows it to the circus grounds, around which he stays all morning, and is finally tempted by his great wish to see the show, to crawl under the tent. He is discovered by a circus guard, and ordered off the ground. A small girl, Lillie Lockwood, and her father come to the circus, and witness Tom's ejection. Urged by his daughter, Lillie's father buys Tom a ticket of admission, giving him his first <b>happy</b> <b>day.</b> In return, Tom gives Lillie, as a keepsake, his most treasured possession, his pocket knife. On returning home, Tom is severely chastised by his step-father, after which he decides to run away. He walks to a neighboring town, and is there engaged as an office boy by Gates, a lawyer. After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares he had loved her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar." ...|$|E

5000|$|Out of the Blue has engendered debate amongst some viewers {{concerning}} its precise {{relationship to}} <b>Happy</b> <b>Days.</b> The controversy {{arises from the}} fact that the first episode of the show was broadcast a little over one week prior to an episode of <b>Happy</b> <b>Days</b> featuring Jimmy Brogan as the character Random. Television observer and owner of Sitcoms Online, Todd Fuller, maintains that because [...] "Chachi Sells His Soul" [...] aired on September 18, 1979, Random's appearance on this <b>Happy</b> <b>Days</b> episode was a crossover. He goes on to postulate: [...] "The <b>Happy</b> <b>Days</b> episode was likely a promotional tool for Out of the Blue to make the character more known." ...|$|R

Hicks continued to write light, escapist comedies, such as The <b>Happy</b> <b>Day</b> (1916), Sleeping Partners (1917) and, after the war, satiric farces, such as Good Luck and Head Over Heels (1923) and adaptations of French farces (The Man in Dress Clothes).|$|E

[...] The politics of the Soviet Union did not allow him to work as a historian, so Meri found work as a dramatist in the Vanemuine, the oldest theatre of Estonia, and later on as a producer of radio plays in the Estonian broadcasting industry.

As musical director at the Empire Theatre, Jones wrote the ballets, The Bugle Call (1905) and Cinderella (1906), which was danced at Christmas-time. Later, back at the light-hearted Gaiety Theatre, with The Girl from Utah in 1913, and at Daly's Theatre, with The <b>Happy</b> <b>Day</b> in 1916, Jones achieved two last successes. [...] However, Jones, like his sometime collaborator Lionel Monckton, fell victim to changing musical fashions {{around the time of}} World War I, such as syncopated dance rhythms like ragtime, and retired from composition.|$|E
