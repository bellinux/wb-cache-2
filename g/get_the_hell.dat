Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe on a golf course, the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up to you. <b>Get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> off of the course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|E
500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E

At 09:05, German observers reported that WN-61 was lost, and that one machine gun was still firing from WN-62. 150 men, mostly from G/16, having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire, continued south to attack the WN-63 command post {{on the edge of}} Colleville. Meanwhile, E/16, led by Second Lieutenant John M. Spalding and Captain Robert L. Sheppard V, turned westward {{along the top of the}} bluffs, engaging in a two-hour battle for WN-64.

[...] During the group's sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional prank calls. The band demoed the album sufficiently so that it would be completely written and sequenced before they went to record. Hoping to clear his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong traveled to New York City alone for a few weeks, renting a small loft in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions in the basement of Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. He began socializing with songwriters Ryan Adams and Jesse Malin. Many songs from the album were written based on his time in Manhattan, including [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and [...] "Are We the Waiting".

When his business began to suffer because he did not belong to a group, Kane approached two members of <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels, Walter Stadnick and David “Wolf” Carroll, with hope that they could <b>get</b> him into <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels.

Kane was upset because he had worked with the gang for several years and was not even considered a hang around. Kane’s luck then changed. Kane was “recruited by David (Wolf) Carroll and Walter (Nurgent) Stadnick to preside over three chapters of an Ontario puppet gang called the Demon Keepers.” The plan did not work out because Carroll was a serious alcoholic and never had money to support the gang which meant they could not intimidate drug dealers in cities such as Ottawa, Cornwall and Toronto. Once Kane was arrested Stadnick shut down the Demon Keepers. After Kane was released from jail for his April 1994 weapons charges, he began to hate <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels.

2500|$|Facing a Dallas {{defense that}} had allowed its {{previous}} six opponents {{an average of}} less than ten points per game, the Buccaneers were in immediate trouble. Doug Williams was sacked on the game's very first play. Field position was a problem, with the Buccaneers' first-half drives starting {{at an average of}} the 19-yard line. Tampa Bay was only able to advance beyond midfield four times during the entire game, and Williams was pressured into mistakes by a constant Dallas pass rush. The ground game was held to only 2 yards in the second half, with James Owens starting at running back in place of the injured Jerry Eckwood.

Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt.

As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top turnbuckle, sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a rake on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. Mike Chioda, the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme. Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter {{to break out of the}} hold. At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, [...] "Ring the bell!" [...] McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, [...] "Ring the fucking bell!" [...] Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall. Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion. Michaels was ordered by McMahon to [...] "pick up the damn belt and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of here!"

Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage.
