O'Hara noted that whenever her mother left the house, men would leave their houses just so they could catch a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in the street. O'Hara's siblings were Peggy, the oldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot, and Jimmy. Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, becoming a Sister of Charity.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door to catch a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules {{at the top of}} his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{starred in}} three movies in 1941, the first being The Great Lie, {{opposite}} George Brent. It was a refreshingly different role for Davis, as {{she played a}} kind, sympathetic character. Brent tickled Davis during many of the film's scenes, which allowed the audience, used to Davis' strong-willed character, a rare <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> succumbing to giggles and squirms.|$|E

500|$|Since Elsa is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} child {{at the beginning of the}} film, animators wanted the first <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> powers to reflect her innocent and fanciful state of mind at the time. This included giving her first snowflakes a simple design. Her snow and ice patterns later become more intricate and complex when she is an adult. Co-effects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, [...] "When Elsa finally lets go and really starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, we wanted the ice and snow that she make to get across the idea that Elsa has now grown up and become this beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams in [...] "What Do You Think? The X-Files, Liminality, and Gender Pleasure", [...] "Humbug" [...] {{is about}} [...] "difference, sex, and looking". Regarding The X-Files as a whole, {{they say that}} the {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully is non-sexual and [...] "quasi-marital". Although sharing a degree of intimacy that allows them to share each other's space, they avoid a sexual or objectifying gaze: [...] "They look into each other's eyes and argue ideas, rather than gazing at each other's bodies." [...] This status quo is challenged in this episode as the objectifying gaze is highlighted and deconstructed, although not between the partners themselves. According to Wilcox and Williams, a key scene involves Agent Scully and Lanny. When Lanny goes to wake Scully in her trailer one morning, he catches a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts; she inadvertently exposes herself as she in turn catches sight of Lanny's uncovered parasitic twin; [...] "each gaze involves the objectification of difference". This objectification is emphasized by the fact that Scully's body is not normally revealed in this way.|$|E
500|$|Golder {{identified}} [...] "Esther’s scarily casual death" [...] {{as one of}} the gripping {{points of}} what he felt to be an underwhelming finale. The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and saddening shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was sad because the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something to go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E

60|$|The {{street that}} night {{had all the}} enchantment of Granada to me. The girl's voice rippled with a music {{like that of the}} {{fountain}} Lindarazza, and when I caught <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sweet, serious face beneath her hat-rim, I dreaded our parting. The nearer to her gate we drew the more tremulous my voice became, and the more uncertain my step.|$|R
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I caught a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> through the door. Sitting {{on top of the}} piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
500|$|Crystal Bell of MTV {{wrote that}} the ballad [...] "gives Ariel a purpose, reveals her deepest desire — to be where the people are — and shows us a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> strengths, vulnerabilities, and {{individual}} quirks", while establishing Ariel as an outsider. Writing for The Atlantic, Akash Nikolas agreed that as the film's [...] "I Want" [...] song, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] follows Disney's trend of establishing the main character as an outcast [...] "set apart from society by some innate desire" [...] as Ariel literally longs to be belong to a different world. Film critic Theresa Basile identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song that belongs to an adventurer who wants to explore new environments. Zaron Burnett III, writing for Thought Catalog, described the selection as a ballad in which [...] "a curious young woman ... who doesn’t fully understand the world she longs {{to be a part}} of, bravely dreams of how she can move into a new world, and reject the limitations of her father’s world (read: patriarchy)", identifying Ariel as [...] "a young feminist." [...] Meanwhile, the New York Daily News film critic Kathleen Carroll identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "typically plaintive solo" [...] that helps establish Ariel as a Broadway ingenue. Distinguished from earlier [...] "wish songs" [...] that discuss searching for [...] "happiness in everyday life", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is about longing to abandon normalcy in favor of seeking happiness elsewhere. Comparing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] from Cinderella, Entertainment Weekly writer Esther Zuckerman observed that the song proves how different Ariel is from Disney princesses by whom she was preceded. While Cinderella's [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] is a passive song performed in third person, Ariel's number [...] "is brimming with agency" [...] to demonstrate the character's thirst for knowledge. Zuckerman credits Ashman's lyrics with providing Ariel with a personality, something she believes Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959) lacked, while giving Ariel a motive that is not romance-oriented. Additionally, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is delivered directly to the camera as opposed to an audience of woodland animals; Ariel appears as though she is speaking directly to young girls who are watching the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Misconceptions {{examines}} modern assumptions surrounding {{pregnancy and}} childbirth. Most {{of the book}} is told through the prism of Wolf's personal experience of her first pregnancy. She describes the [...] "vacuous impassivity" [...] of the ultrasound technician who gives her the first <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> new baby. Wolf both laments her C-section and examines why the procedure is commonplace in the United States, and advocates a return to more personal approaches to childbirth such as midwifery. The second half of the book catalogs a series of anecdotes about life after giving birth, focusing in particular on inequalities that arise in men and women's approaches and adjustments to child care.|$|E

Oh, Agnes, sister of my boyhood, if I had known then, what I knew long afterwards--! ...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as it}} {{was late}} enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs. Plymdale, Mr. Ned's mother, and entered with pretty {{congratulations}} into the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale's maternal view was, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.|$|R

Rencounters of not more than a minute's duration, frequently repeated, will build up mutual interest, even an intimacy, in a lonely place. Theirs grew as imperceptibly as the tree-twigs budded. There never was a particular moment at which {{it could be said}} they became friends; yet a delicate understanding now existed between two who in the winter had been strangers.|$|R
2500|$|After Louis' execution, Marie Antoinette's fate {{became a}} central {{question}} of the National Convention. While some advocated her death, others proposed exchanging her for French prisoners of war or for a ransom from the Holy Roman Emperor. Thomas Paine advocated exile to America. In April 1793, during the Reign of Terror, a Committee of Public Safety dominated by Robespierre was formed, and men such as Jacques Hébert began to call for Marie-Antoinette's trial. By the end of May, the Girondins had been chased from power. Calls were also made to [...] "retrain" [...] the eight-year old Louis XVII, to make him pliant to revolutionary ideas. To carry this out, Louis Charles was separated from his mother on 3 July after a heartwrenching struggle during which his mother fought in vain to retain her son, who was handed over to Antoine Simon, a cobbler and representative of the Paris Commune. Until her removal from the Temple, Marie Antoinette spent hours trying to catch a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son, who, within weeks, {{had been made to}} turn against her, accusing his mother of wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Dowager Sophie Amalie died in February 1685. On {{the morning}} of 19 May 1685 Leonora Christina was {{informed}} that a royal order had been issued by Chancellor Frederick von Ahlfeldt (he who had reluctantly escorted her into the Tower) for her release. But she refused the guard's offer to unlock her cell until, at 10 o'clock that night, denied a final private audience with the Queen and fetched by Sophie Amalie Lindenov, the daughter of her long-dead sister Elisabeth Augusta Lindenov, the destitute Countess left the Blue Tower forever {{under cover of darkness}} and a veil, denying even a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face to the curious crowd that had gathered in the courtyard (the Queen and her ladies watched from the palace balcony). For them Leonora Christina had already entered into legend [...] a royal adventuress who had been first regaled then held captive by the kings of England, Sweden and Denmark. She was sixty-three years old, and had spent twenty-one years, nine months and eleven days in the Tower. She lived her last years quietly on the grounds of Maribo Monastery, where she occupied her time editing her prison notebooks.|$|E

60|$|Allen was {{convinced}} at last {{that he was}} designedly given up, and so far from trying to meet his faithless lady, dejectedly refused all society where he could fall in with her, and only wandered about the parks to feed his melancholy with distant <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> on horseback, while Armine and Barbara, who held Elvira very cheap, were wicked enough to laugh at him between themselves and term him the forsaken merman.|$|R
60|$|He soon {{advanced}} abreast <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> {{and could}} get <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> profile against the roadstead lights. It was dignified, arresting, {{that of a}} very Juno. Nothing more classical had he ever seen. She walked at a swinging pace, yet with such ease and power that there was but little difference in their rate of speed for several minutes; and during this time he regarded and conjectured. However, {{he was about to}} pass her by when she suddenly turned and addressed him.|$|R
60|$|There was a tone in the girl's voice {{which sent}} a little thrill through the man.

A short passage led from the stage to the green-room door, which was wide open, and at the corner of this passage the young man had paused {{from time to time in}} his walk, gazing with earnest admiration at the dainty outline of the young girl's head, with its wig of powdered curls that seemed scarcely whiter than the creamy brilliance <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skin.|$|R

These are the figures one mostly sees at Saratoga; there is very little youth of the present day there, but the youth of the past abounds, with the belated yellow hair and the purple moustaches, which gave a notion of greater wickedness in a former generation.|$|R
