30|$|The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) {{documented}} many of {{the myths}} about using the visible appearance of damage to identify arson (Boudreau et al. 1977). Arson investigators were surveyed about how they investigate fires and cited interpretation of “burn indicators” as the most common method of establishing arson. Some of these indicators used were alligatoring, crazing of <b>glass,</b> <b>depth</b> of char, lines of demarcation, sagged furniture springs and spalled concrete. The LEAA report, after listing the indicators, identified that these indicators have received little or no scientific testing and that “there {{appears to be no}} published material in the scientific literature to substantiate their validity” (Boudreau et al. 1977). Despite the lack of validity and this caution, the training and textbooks within the profession during this time used these indicators as a means to link an observation to the speed of the fire and ultimately to the conclusion of fire cause.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{technique}} is developed to determine temperature profiles in hot glass melts, using intensity measurements performed at various wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. To that end an analytical model is developed which describes the internal energy transfer in a glass layer and the spectral intensity emerging from the glass layer. The so calculated spectral intensity is confronted with a measured spectral intensity to reconstruct the temperature profile in the glass layer. Because the temperature reconstruction from the measured spectral intensity is an ill-posed inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization and the L-curve method are used to determine a meaningful temperature distribution in the glass layer. In order to investigate {{the usefulness of the}} temperature reconstruction method an experimental setup is built. Measurements are performed for various temperature gradients, glass depths and glass types. The temperature difference over the <b>glass</b> <b>depth</b> measured by a thermocouple minus that measured by the optical method is, on average, of the order of 2 K...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of several microporous virus-adsorbent media for reliably detecting {{low levels of}} poliovirus from 380 and 1, 900 liters of drinking water by use of the tentative standard method was investigated. The virus-adsorbent media tested were (i) nitrocellulose membrane filters, (ii) epoxy-fiber glass-asbestos filters, (iii) yarn-wound fiber <b>glass</b> <b>depth</b> filters, and (iv) epoxy-fiber glass filter tubes. Virus was adsorbed to the filter media at pH 3. 5 and eluted with glycine buffer, pH 11. 5. The results from 44 samples demonstrated that poliovirus was detected with a 95 % reliability at mean virus input levels of 3 to 7 plaque-forming units/ 380 liters when 1, 900 liters of water was sampled. At mean virus input levels of less than 1 to 2 plaque-forming units/ 380 liters, the detection reliability was 66 % in 76 samples when 1, 900 liters of water was sampled. No significant difference in virus detection sensitivity was observed among the various virus adsorbent media tested. Overall virus recovery efficiency ranged from 28 to 42 %, with a grand average of 35 %. Members of the coxsackievirus groups A and B, echovirus, and adenovirus were also detected when 380 and 1, 900 liters of water were sampled.

40|$|The {{need for}} a Combustion and Melting Research Facility focused on the {{solution}} of glass manufacturing problems common to all segments of the glass industry was given high priority in the earliest version of the Glass Industry Technology Roadmap (Eisenhauer et al., 1997). Visteon Glass Systems and, later, PPG Industries proposed to meet this requirement, {{in partnership with the}} DOE/OIT Glass Program and Sandia National Laboratories, by designing and building a research furnace equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostics in the DOE Combustion Research Facility located at the Sandia site in Livermore, CA. Input on the configuration and objectives of the facility was sought from the entire industry by a variety of routes: (1) through a survey distributed to industry leaders by GMIC, (2) by conducting an open workshop following the OIT Glass Industry Project Review in September 1999, (3) from discussions with numerous glass engineers, scientists, and executives, and (4) during visits to glass manufacturing plants and research centers. The recommendations from industry were that the melting tank be made large enough to reproduce the essential processes and features of industrial furnaces yet flexible enough to be operated in as many as possible of the configurations found in industry as well as in ways never before attempted in practice. Realization of these objectives, while still providing access to the glass bath and combustion space for optical diagnostics and measurements using conventional probes, was the principal challenge {{in the development of the}} tank furnace design. The present report describes a facility having the requirements identified as important by members of the glass industry and equipped to do the work that the industry recommended should be the focus of research. The intent is that the laboratory would be available to U. S. glass manufacturers for collaboration with Sandia scientists and engineers on both precompetitive basic research and the solution of proprietary glass production problems. As a consequence of the substantial increase in scale and scope of the initial furnace concept in response to industry recommendations, constraints on funding of industrial programs by DOE, and reorientation of the Department's priorities, the OIT Glass Program is unable to provide the support for construction of such a facility. However, it is the present investigators' hope that a group of industry partners will emerge to carry the project forward, taking advantage of the detailed furnace design presented in this report. The engineering, including complete construction drawings, bill of materials, and equipment specifications, is complete. The project is ready to begin construction as soon as the quotations are updated. The design of the research melter closely follows the most advanced industrial practice, firing by natural gas with oxygen. The melting area is 13 ft x 6 ft, with a <b>glass</b> <b>depth</b> of 3 ft and an average height in the combustion space of 3 ft. The maximum pull rate is 25 tons/day, ranging from 100 % batch to 100 % cullet, continuously fed, with variable batch composition, particle size distribution, and raft configuration. The tank is equipped with bubblers to control glass circulation. The furnace can be fired in three modes: (1) using a single large burner mounted on the front wall, (2) by six burners in a staggered/opposed arrangement, three in each breast wall, and (3) by down-fired burners mounted in the crown in any combination with the front wall or breast-wall-mounted burners. Horizontal slots are provided between the tank blocks and tuck stones and between the breast wall and skewback blocks, running the entire length of the furnace on both sides, to permit access to the combustion space and the surface of the glass for optical measurements and sampling probes. Vertical slots in the breast walls provide additional access for measurements and sampling. The furnace and tank are to be fully instrumented with standard measuring equipment, such as flow meters, thermocouples, continuous gas composition analyzers, optical pyrometers, and a video camera. The output from the instruments is to be continuously recorded and simultaneously made available to other researchers via the Internet. A unique aspect of the research facility would be its access to the expertise in optical measurements in flames and high temperature reacting flows residing in the Sandia Combustion Research Facility. Development of new techniques for monitoring and control of glass melting would be a major focus of the work. The lab would be equipped with conventional and laser light sources and detectors for optical measurements of gas temperature, velocity, and gaseous species and, using new techniques to be developed in the Research Facility itself, glass temperature and glass composition...|$|E

40|$|Higher-order {{disparity}} selectivity {{has been}} demonstrated in the lower bank of the rostral superior temporal sulcus (STS), called TEs (Janssen et al., 2000), and in {{a small part of}} the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) (Srivastava et al., 2009). Compared to the TEs neurons, AIP neurons were less sensitive to disparity discontinuities. Monkey fMRI-studies have revealed a strong activation in AIP to 3 D-shapes (Durand et al., 2007). However, fMRI-activations in the inferior temporal cortex (IT) (recorded at 1. 5 T with a single loop coil, Joly et al., 2007) were weak (due to reduced signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) and more posteriorly located than the TES region of single-cell studies. We scanned two macaque monkeys in a 3 T Siemens MR scanner with an 8 -channel phased-array coil (higher SNR) to visualize higher-order disparity sensitivity and to identify differences between IT and AIP in sensitivity to disparity discontinuities. We presented stereo random-dot stimuli in four different depth conditions using a block design: smoothly curved concave and convex surfaces (second-order disparity), linear and discrete approximations of these surfaces, and flat surfaces at different disparities (zero-order disparity). For every depth condition a control condition with no disparity was presented. The stimuli were displayed through red/green anaglyph <b>glasses.</b> <b>Depth</b> structure sensitivity was assessed by the interaction between the factors binocular disparity (disparity vs. no-disparity control condition) and depth order (zero-order disparity vs. second-order disparity). AIP and an adjoining portion of LIP were strongly activated by depth structure (Joly et al., 2009; Durand et al., 2007). Furthermore depth-structure sensitivity was also found in CIP, F 5, V 3, V 4 t/TEO and the lower bank of the STS in IT. In agreement with Joly et al. (2007), the activations in IT were located more posteriorly than the TEs region (Janssen et al., 2000). We assessed the sensitivity for disparity discontinuities by computing the interaction between the factors binocular disparity (disparity vs. no-disparity) and smoothness (smoothly curved vs. linear approximation, and smoothly curved vs. discrete approximation). AIP and a small region in IT were significantly more activated by smooth surfaces compared to discrete approximations, whereas earlier visual areas (CIP, V 4 t/TEO and V 3) did not show any differential activation. No significant differences were observed for the contrast smooth vs. linear approximations. These results indicate that the network of cortical areas involved in the processing of disparity-defined 3 D shape may be more extensive than previously described. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the darkening of sodium and {{potassium}} silicate glasses by a low pressure mercury discharge, using electron spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Initial changes in glass exposed to a mercury discharge are twofold: (i) mercury from the discharge penetrates very rapidly into the <b>glass</b> to <b>depths</b> of the order of 1 nm. (ii) Alkali ions migrate more slowly away from the surface in a photoelectric field that is caused mainly by trapping of photoelectrons. However, mercury entering the glass does not replace alkali ions. Rather, the mercury penetrates into voids in the glass network that are sufficiently close to the surface. From this "surface reservoir " mercury migrates lowly deeper into the glass. This migration is slower in mixed than in single alkali glasses. We assume that mer-cury migrates as ions in a photoelectric field, assisted by photoelectrons. Ultimately the mercury ions are reduced by photoelectrons to atoms that agglomerate into droplets of metallic mercury reponsible for glass darkening. A mercury dis-charge provides not only(i) mercury ions and (excited) atoms entering the glass and(ii) photons, creating aphotoelectric field in the glass. The discharge also provides (iii) low energy electrons flooding the glass. The latter greatly enhance the strength of the photoelectric field in the glass by recombination with photoholes in the glass near the surface. As regards the effect on the darkening of the glass composition, not nly the overall composition is considered (e. g., conductivity, molar volume, shear modulus), but also superficial changes in the composition...|$|R

The influence of translational velocity and pulse energy on the cross-sectional shape and integrity of the written tracks is reported. Tracks tend to be narrower as the pulse energy is lowered or translational velocity decreased. Above 22. 9 nJ, pulse energy, tracks tend to crack.

These glasses normally form nano-glass-ceramics on heat treatment just above the glass transformation temperature (Tg).

For a suspension of flocculent particles it was almost impossible to predict removal without measuring the settling properties of each individual suspension. There is no single universal property of a settling tank with which removal is correlated.

RESULTS: Of the 90 students, 6 (6. 6 %) and 26 (29. 2 %) experienced pain and discomfort, respectively, during cavity preparation, more often in large than in small cavities (p = 0. 003) and in cavities extending into the inner third than in the middle and outer third of dentine (p < 0. 0001). Only 1 student reported postoperative sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The ART approach to treat dental cavities was well accepted by this group of secondary school students. Only a few reported pain during cavity instrumentation, and this was more prevalent in large cavities and in cavities with the floor close to the pulp...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of demineralized freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and bioactive glass by clinically and radiographically in periodontal intrabony defects for a period of 12 months. Materials and Methods: Ten systemically healthy patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, with radiographic evidence of at least a pair of contralateral vertical osseous defects were included in this study. Defect on one-side is treated with DFDBA and the other side with bioactive glass. Clinical and radiographic measurements were made at baseline 6 month and 12 month after the surgery. Results: Compared to baseline, the 12 month results indicated that both treatment modalities resulted in significant changes in all clinical parameters (gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL) and radiographic parameters (bone fill); P < 0. 001 FNx 01). However, sites treated with DFDBA exhibited statistically significantly more changes compared to the bioactive <b>glass</b> in probing <b>depth</b> reduction (2. 5 ± 0. 1 mm vs. 1. 8 ± 0. 1 mm) CAL gain 2. 4 ± 0. 1 mm versus 1. 7 ± 0. 2 mm; (P < 0. 001 FNx 01). At 12 months, sites treated with bioactive glass exhibited 56. 99 % bone fill and 64. 76 % bone fill for DFDBA sites, which is statistically significant (P < 0. 05 FNx 01). Conclusion: After 12 months, there was a significant difference between the two materials with sites grafted with DFDBA showing better reduction in probing pocket depth, gain in CAL and a greater percentage of bone fill when compared to that of bioactive glass...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} powder {{blasting}} as {{a technique to}} structure brittle materials like glass using an erosion resistant mask. The study of the erosion rate shows that the erosion of glass is maximum at a normal incidence of the powder beam while the erosion rate of metals and elastomers is minimum. A metallic contact mask is very resistant, easy to use, but its resolution as defined by its manufacturing process (laser ablation) is limited. The resolution of the mask depends on {{the thickness of the}} metal piece. However due to the stress generated by the powder blasting technnique, the metal mask used must have an important thickness (about 0, 5 mm), which limits the resolution (50 μm). The photolithographic masking method we developed allows to increase the resolution. We have demonstrated that the erosion resistance of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an elastomer very frequently used in microsystems realisation is excellent, and that the use of a photosensitve epoxy resist like SU 8 allows to define high-resolution structures. The replication quality is good as the majority of structures defined in PDMS have the same size compared to the features defined by the SU 8. In our process, the SU 8 is patterned into a mould structure that is filled with PDMS. The SU 8, has a similar erosion behavior as glass and is quickly removed by powder blasting. The resolution of the process determined by the particle size; we have used particles with 10 μm diameter to explore the ultimate limits of powder blasting. The study of the etching by powder blasting shows that the etching rate changes with the width of the channel and the etching time. Furthermore, dimensions of channels or hole structures change during powder blasting, they are increased by the underetching effect. This underetching depends on the depth of the channels and can induce changes in resolution. The erosion mask resistance is function of the thickness of the mask, of the etching time and of the applied pressure. We typically have chosen a PDMS mask thickness of 50 μm. When the applied pressure of the powder jet increases, the PDMS erosion is more important. When an energetic particle impacts on the PDMS, the glass underneath the mask can be damaged and the resolution of the structures is decreased. Experimentally, this PDMS/SU 8 mask is resistant and efficient for an applied pressure up to 200 kPa and for a <b>glass</b> erosion <b>depth</b> of 300 μm for large channels. The minimum feature size is 20 μm, but this depends also on the shape; for example triangular holes are only well defined for a minimum dimension of 60 μm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Soda-Lime {{glass is}} a very hard and brittle {{material}} which is commonly used as window panels and many other common applications. Due to its low fracture toughness {{it is very difficult}} to machine and obtain good surface finish under nornal cutting conditions. Hence, machining has to be done in ways to avoid brittle fracture on the finished machined surface. Such machining is only possible under ductile mode machining conditions when the removal of material is performed in the plastic state. However, ductile mode machining requires that during machining the temperature generated in the cutting zone in the working temperature range of glass to avoid crack formation during machining. This makes all types of machining of glass an extremely challenging affair, given the current state and mode of mechanical machining. This research paper elucidates the results of an experimental study for determination of critical depth of cut as a function of cutting parameters in high speed end milling of soda-lime <b>glass.</b> The critical <b>depth</b> is defined as the depth of cut at which crack formation the material is initiated for a given high speed attachment. In determining the critical depth as well as the ductile brittle transition depth, machining was performed on a tapered surface. Vibration signals from an accelerometer in time domain (amplitude vs. time display) and the surface characteristics were used in identifying the critical depth of cut. The new method has been found to be useful in online determination of the critical depth, as well as the brittle-ductile transition depth, for generating crack-free surfaces with good surface finish in high speed end milling of soda lime glass...|$|R
30|$|No {{sufficient}} data were found regarding well failures in geothermal wells of the Menegai geothermal field. The main challenges experienced during drilling of high-temperature wells {{in that area}} were incidents of stuck pipe between well depths of 2100  m and 2200  m, where magma was encountered. Drilling of the MW- 01 well was performed with partial and total circulation losses. The drill string got stuck {{at the end of}} drilling at 2206  m (Makuk 2013; Mbia 2014). During drilling the MW- 03 well, the similar situation occurred at depths of 1187 and 2112  m. The well MW- 04 yielded cuttings of freshly quenched volcanic <b>glass</b> at a <b>depth</b> of 2080  m. Drilling close to this magma resulted in problems such as stuck pipe at 2117  m and the drill bit damages, due to extremely high temperatures. After unsuccessful fishing operations, around 20  m of bottom hole assembly, composed of a drill bit, sub, stabilizer, and two drill collars was abandoned inside the well. The completion was carried out with a slotted liner above the ‘fish’. At final depth, rather low permeability values were encountered. Only intermittent and partial losses were experienced at the deepest well sections and no serious circulation loss problems were encountered (Mbia 2014). The MW- 06 well (also called MW- 05) yielded freshly quenched volcanic glassy cuttings at a depth of 2172  m. Drilling in the close vicinity to magma resulted in challenges such as stuck pipe at 2203  m. Similarly, as in MW- 04, the bottom hole assembly with the length of 21  m, composed of a drill bit, sub and two drill collars was left in the wellbore and the borehole was completed with a slotted liner above the ‘fish’ (Makuk 2013; Mibei 2012).|$|R

40|$|Volume {{rendering}} is a {{well known}} technique for visualizing volumetric data, and is commonly used {{in many areas of}} science. In four dimensional cardiac ultrasound (3 D + time), volume rendering is used to present the user {{with a view of the}} three dimensional structures of the human heart in real-time. However, ultrasound suffers from imaging artifacts including high gray-level variance and dropouts. This makes it challenging to generate high quality volume renderings. This thesis has focused on how to auto-optimize volume renderings by locally applying adaptive opacity transfer functions and dynamical anatomical cropping, based on segmentation results. In addition, stereoscopic visualization through newly available technology for the gaming marked has been investigated and evaluated. Locally applied adaptive opacity transfer functions (LOTF) has for the first time been tested out. The method is based on estimating the opacity function parameters, like the slope position and steepness locally from the volume data. Both a method using per ray edge detection, based on a transition criterion, and a method estimating the per ray mean and standard deviation (statistical thresholding surface) has been proposed and investigated. To regularize the LOTF calculations, methods incorporating segmentation results has also been designed and tested. Auto-optimized methods for dynamical cropping defined by model based segmentation has been proposed. This gives a new way of cropping ultrasound volume renderings. Two approaches has been investigated, one that applies volume depth peeling (hard segmentation crop), and one that applies a novel local opacity weighting scheme for creation of a soft border between included and excluded data (soft segmentation crop). Stereoscopic renderings of ultrasound based on liquid shutter glasses technology has been tested out and evaluated. Standard tests for fine depth perception and tailored test for depth encoding has been applied. A stereoscopic setup gives the opportunity for different ways of rendering ultrasound data. The method proposed here applies a high transparency rendering scheme in combination with stereoscopic visualization. The setup also makes depth encoding in stereo available. Among the proposed auto-optimization methods the LOTF based on the statistical thresholding surface shows the most potential. The method removes low level echoes from the rendering, making it bright and sharp. At the same time it also preserves structures of interest. The method also shows good results when we restrict the estimation to segmentation results. In fact, the expert users reported this method to perform better than the global OTF in some cases. There has been found no statistical difference between the anaglyph and liquid shutter glasses stereoscopic techniques when it comes to fine depth perception. Also the introduction of depth encoding in stereo showed no statistically significant improvement compared to a grayscale rendering. However, experts on image quality favored the liquid shutter <b>glasses</b> technique with <b>depth</b> encoding included, compared to an anaglyph grayscale rendering. The reason for this, may be the result of other parameters than the tested depth perception. Among these we have pure aesthetics, less ghosting and eye strain...|$|R
