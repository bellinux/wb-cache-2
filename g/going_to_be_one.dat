The International {{was part}} of a triple header which also {{included}} the Melanesian Cup, between Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. The game was an absolute thriller with the lead alternating between the teams and the biggest margin throughout the match was only 6 points. However, there was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> winner in the see-saw affair and it was Samoa who upended Mate Ma'a Tonga to win the Polynesian Cup by 18–16.|$|E
25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, {{the story of a}} Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E

Phil Harrison, writing for The Guardian, characterised the episode as [...] "a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them". Possibilities for macabre developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's [...] "pills" [...] are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list—as revealed in his [...] "David Brentish" [...] speech—has no sinister purpose.

A few days later, however, the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his family: [...] "When you have a season as a freshman like he did, the NBA, they like them young," [...] Trey's father, Benji Burke said.

Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) bought [...] in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C, management of Everglades National Park or the Department of the Interior. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from The Miami Herald {{the day it was}} announced. The DCPA bulldozed the land it had bought, and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined; the location chosen was [...] north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: [...] "This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the great population centers of America.

[...] Journalist J.C. Maçek III of Spectrum Culture wrote [...] "The truth is {{that it might be}} easy to dismiss Slayer after almost 35 years as a nostalgic metal act. This would be a travesty and a mistake. Slayer not only has something new to say on Repentless, but a new way to say it." [...] AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three out of five stars, calling Repentless [...] "a retro, workmanlike effort from a band determined to soldier on, and that's fine. There are hardcore devotees who never want their favorite bands to change; this is for them. But again, given all that's transpired since 2009, Slayer get points for even pulling this off." [...] The Guardian stated that [...] "Slayer have always been a model of consistency and a band that fans of vicious, vein-bursting heavy metal can rely on." [...] Kim Kelly, writing in Spin was less enthusiastic, calling the album [...] "middling" [...] and stating that it [...] "mostly falls flat." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> hell of a player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", {{as well as being}} able to unlock defences.

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show.

The story's climax, resulting in Chrissie's exit from Walford, was such a considerable moment for the show that BBC bosses took the highly unusual step of keeping the [...] "manner of her departure" [...] a [...] "complete mystery even to the soap's [...] producers", with reports claiming that [...] "no less than four separate storylines [...] to be filmed for her departure from EastEnders". Commenting at the time to NOW, Oberman said, [...] "I think Chrissie deserves to get away with murder. She was heavily provoked. I'd love to see her make it to Argentina... run a beach bar with a young Latin lover by her side."

[...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You know exactly who you are'."

500|$|How far Hogarth sympathised with Pope is questionable. The {{original}} bill mocked him, but it featured in an image that, at the least, poked {{fun at the}} poor poet who was the subject. Hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for Pope or that he placed Pope's image above his head as a model to which to aspire. In the second image, which shows Pope and Curll locked in battle, {{it is not clear}} who has the upper hand, {{and by the time the}} print was issued the direct reference to Pope had been removed completely. Ronald Paulson, the preeminent modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that Hogarth would have viewed Pope, through his Roman Catholicism, as having been implicitly tied to the continental influences that Hogarth despised, and would have seen Pope's refusal to accept the patronage of the great men of the time, while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping the rewards they had to offer, as hypocritical. Pope was part of the circle that included William Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who had displaced Hogarth's father-in-law James Thornhill from commissions, and Hogarth also had ties to Lewis Theobald, a possible target of the satire, through illustrations he had produced for Theobald's Perseus and Andromeda, and through his subscription to Theobald's edition of the works of Shakespeare. Paulson suggests that the real [...] "villain" [...] of The Distrest Poet may be Pope, unseen but representing the successful [...] "Great Poet" [...] whom the deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate, rather than the distressed poet himself. [...] Hogarth had featured Pope picking John Gay's pocket in the foreground of Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme, an early print he had produced on the theme of the South Sea Bubble (both Pope and Gay had invested money in the scheme). At the same time, within the satire of the painting, the poet who is distressed is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of Pope's dunces.|$|E
