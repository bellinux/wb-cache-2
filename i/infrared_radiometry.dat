40|$|This paper {{describes}} microwave-source time-resolved <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometry</b> (MW-TRIR) as {{a method}} for the detection and characterization of microwave absorption by conductive fibers and other absorbing regions in dielectric materials. Due to recent technical developments in the speed, detector array size, and sensitivity of infrared focalplane arrays, time-resolved <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometry</b> has evolved into an important NDE tool which allows fast area inspection at high spatial resolution. While much prior work {{has focused on the}} detection of structural defects or disbonds in a variety of materials [1, 2], the increasing importance of composite materials requires new approaches to inspection which allow characterization of local material properties. Defects in such materials may have little thermal contrast compared to the matrix material and may be invisible using conventional <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometry</b> methods. However, where the embedding material is a weak microwave absorber, localized microwave absorbing regions can be detected easily. There are three different classes of absorption processes: (1) dielectric loss (e. g. water), (2) magnetic loss, and (3) Joule heating (e. g. electromagnetic radiation interaction with conducting fibers) ...|$|E

40|$|Among {{diffusion}} methods, photothermal radiometry (PTR) has {{the ability}} to penetrate and yield information about an opaque medium well beyond the range of conventional optical imaging. Owing to this ability, pulsed-laser PTR has been extensively used in turbid media such as biological tissues to study the sub-surface deposition of laser radiation, a task which may be difficult or impossible for conventional optical methods due to excessive scattering and absorption. In this work, the optical and thermal properties of tissue-like materials are observed using frequency-domain <b>infrared</b> photothermal <b>radiometry.</b> An approximate three-dimensional heat conduction formulation with the use of one-dimensional optical diffusion is developed to derive a turbid frequency-domain PTR model. The agreement in the absorption and transport scattering coefficients of model phantoms is investigated.

40|$|In this work, {{the optical}} and thermal {{properties}} of tissuelike materials are measured by using frequency-domain <b>infrared</b> photothermal <b>radiometry.</b> This technique is {{better suited for}} quantitative multiparameter optical measurements than the widely used pulsed-laser photothermal radiometry (PPTR) because {{of the availability of}} two independent signal channels, amplitude and phase, and the superior signal-to-noise ratio provided by synchronous lock-in detection. A rigorous three-dimensional (3 -D) thermal-wave formulation with a 3 -D diffuse and coherent photon-density-wave source is applied to data from model phantoms. The combined theoretical, experimental, and computational methodology shows good promise with regard to its analytical ability to measure optical properties of turbid media uniquely, as compared with PPTR, which exhibits uniqueness problems. From data sets obtained by using calibrated test phantoms, the reduced optical scattering and absorption coefficients were found to be within 20 % and 10 %, respectively, of the values independently derived by using Mie theory and spectrophotometric measurements. © 2001 Optical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Infrared</b> (IR) <b>radiometry</b> {{technology}} {{is an important}} method for characterizing the IR signature of targets, such as aircrafts or rockets. However, the received signal of targets could be reduced {{by a combination of}} atmospheric molecule absorption and aerosol scattering. Therefore, atmospheric correction is a requisite step for obtaining the real radiance of targets. Conventionally, the atmospheric transmittance and the air path radiance are calculated by an atmospheric radiative transfer calculation software. In this paper, an improved IR radiometric method based on constant reference correction of atmospheric attenuation is proposed. The basic principle and procedure of this method are introduced, and then the linear model of high-speed calibration in consideration of the integration time is employed and confirmed, which is then applicable in various complex conditions. To eliminate stochastic errors, radiometric experiments were conducted for multiple integration times. Finally, several experiments were performed on a mid-wave IR system with Φ 600 mm aperture. The radiometry results indicate that the radiation inversion precision of the novel method is 4. 78 – 4. 89 %, while the precision of the conventional method is 10. 86 – 13. 81 %...|$|R
