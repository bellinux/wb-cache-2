500|$|Breyfogle's {{characterization}} of Anarky has shifted on occasion, {{with him at}} times referring to Anarky as a villain, {{and at other times}} as a hero. In his 1998 introductory essay composed for , Breyfogle characterized Anarky as not being a villain, but rather a [...] "misunderstood hero", and continued [...] "he's a philosophical action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere 'crime-fighter' status into the realm of incisive social commentary." [...] A year later, Breyfogle conceded that Anarky was [...] "technically" [...] a villain, but insisted [...] "I don't consider him a villain..." [...] Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: [...] "Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character.

500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill.

500|$|Burton became {{attached}} as director, while producer Denise Di Novi {{and writer}} Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of {{his plans to}} direct Catwoman or an adaptation of [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, [...] "Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened {{may not have been}} my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fun-for-the-whole-family script." [...] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry.|$|E

Morgenthau said, [...] "We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, {{while at the same time}} respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme." [...] Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, [...] "The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look." [...] Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, [...] "It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You do a lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages.

500|$|The {{creation}} {{of such a}} pronounced structural imbalance so {{early on in the}} game implies that Black aims to counterattack rather than equalize.

500|$|After Jinnah died, {{his sister}} Fatima {{asked the court}} to execute Jinnah's will under Shia Islamic law. This {{subsequently}} became the part of the argument in Pakistan about Jinnah's religious affiliation. Vali Nasr says Jinnah [...] "was an Ismaili by birth and a Twelver Shia by confession, though not a religiously observant man." [...] In a 1970 legal challenge, Hussain Ali Ganji Walji claimed Jinnah had converted to Sunni Islam. Witness Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada stated in court that Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam in 1901 when his sisters married Sunnis. In 1970, Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah's joint affidavit that Jinnah was Shia was rejected. But in 1976 the court rejected Walji's claim that Jinnah was Sunni; effectively accepting him as a Shia. In 1984 a high court bench reversed the 1976 verdict and maintained that [...] "the Quaid was <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Shia", which suggested that Jinnah was Sunni. According to the journalist Khaled Ahmed, Jinnah publicly had a non-sectarian stance and [...] "was at pains to gather the Muslims of India under the banner of a general Muslim faith and not under a divisive sectarian identity." [...] Liaquat H. Merchant, Jinnah's grandnephew, writes that [...] "the Quaid was not a Shia; he was also not a Sunni, he was simply a Muslim". An eminent lawyer who practised in the Bombay High Court until 1940 testified that Jinnah used to pray as an orthodox Sunni. According to Akbar Ahmed, Jinnah became a firm Sunni Muslim {{by the end of his}} life.|$|E

2500|$|Donskoy {{concluded}} {{the creature was}} non-human {{on the basis of}} its weight, and especially its gait, which Donskoy judged would be difficult, if not impossible, for a human to replicate. He inferred the film's subject was weighty from the ponderous momentum he observed in the movements of its arms and legs, in the sagging of the knee as weight came onto it, and in the flatness of the foot. Its gait he considered non-artificial because it was confident and unwavering, [...] "neatly expressive," [...] and well-coordinated—and yet non-human because its arm motion and glide resembled a cross-country skier's.

2500|$|In the Graeco-Roman world, {{practitioners}} of magic {{were known as}} magi (singular magus), a [...] "foreign" [...] title of Persian priests.

2500|$|FairVote {{has been}} accused of having a liberal bias. Scott James of The New York Times {{referred}} to FairVote as a [...] "left-wing group" [...] whose members [...] "have relentlessly berated people who have raised concerns." [...] Other writers claim that many FairVote policies, such as RCV, are popular in [...] "liberal enclaves" [...] and supported by [...] "populist groups" [...] such as Common Cause, a liberal advocacy organization, and thus give the group a liberal tilt. Louis Jacobson, a writer for Roll Call, argues that any group supporting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact will be perceived as liberal-leaning because of Democratic frustration with the Electoral College after the 2000 Presidential Election. But Rob Richie, FairVote's executive director, has said, [...] " [...] is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Democratic stalking horse." [...] In addition, FairVote points to John Anderson, one of their founders and a current member of the Board of Directors, who ran for President as an Independent in 1980.

50|$|To sum up: The {{focus on}} {{cultural}} institutions sphere demands {{a synthesis of}} cultural, sociological, organizational, and economic methods of analysis and interpretation to create a multi-perspective approach to the relevant issues. However, culture and cultural practices are <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> object that may be observed and described from a distant, “scientific” point of view. Cultural issues are matters of public interest and are interwoven with personal and collective identities {{as well as with}} normative and political positions.

30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the aforementioned reports, both HGT as well as hybridization might {{be responsible for the}} topology of phylogenetic trees and the puzzling position of some species. Reconstruction of evolutionary history in genera strongly affected by reticulation and polyploidization is <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> easy task. Importantly, Cyrtochilum and Odontoglossum species inhabit similar geographical regions and plant communities, i.e. Andean humid montane and premontane forests, often growing together, which facilitates gene/genome transfer. The Andes are a well-known centre of biodiversity, where the process of speciation can take place freely as a result of various geographic conditions (cf. Bates et al. 2008; Richter et al. 2009), and ecological factors. Of course, it could be one of many other explanations for the observed topology of the Cyrtochilum phylogenetic tree.|$|R
