The old city of Sana'a in Yemen has stained glass windows in its tall buildings.|$|E

[...] The party tried to revitalize the Premier's image through publicity movies, though efforts were mixed. [...] In one, which was pulled after a single showing, Strom appeared scowling in his living room, urging Albertans to lower their expectations of government. [...] Another, produced by Tommy Banks and showing Strom <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>settings</b> talking about the province's changing face, was more successful.|$|E
