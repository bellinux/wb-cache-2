25|$|<b>Greywater</b> systems reuse drained {{wash water}} to flush toilets or to water lawns and gardens. <b>Greywater</b> systems can halve the water use of most {{residential}} buildings; however, they require {{the purchase of}} a sump, <b>greywater</b> pressurization pump, and secondary plumbing. Some builders are installing waterless urinals and even composting toilets that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the reuse of <b>greywater,</b> Jordan’s Ministry of Water {{promotes}} {{this alternative}} source {{especially in the}} agricultural sector, but also in hotels, government premises and on the individual household level. The most important motivation for using <b>greywater</b> - next to saving freshwater - is to cut down water bills.|$|E
25|$|Flush toilets {{could be}} {{modified}} to use less water or reuse <b>greywater.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{comparison}} between UDDTs and septic tank-based sanitation systems is not as straightforward as {{the comparison}} with pit latrines as a septic system also treats <b>greywater.</b> However, the relatively high costs of septic systems, particularly mound-type septic systems can be partially mitigated or, if {{used in conjunction with}} an onsite <b>greywater</b> system, eliminated altogether by installing UDDTs in place of flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Greywater</b> {{could be}} source-separated from the blackwater from toilets thus {{simplifying}} its treatment and {{providing opportunities for}} reuse.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, non-potable {{forms of}} {{wastewater}} generated by humans may {{be referred to}} as <b>greywater,</b> which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and blackwater, which generally contains sewage and other forms of waste which require further treatment in order to be made reusable. <b>Greywater</b> composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment (sinks, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.|$|E
25|$|Users seek {{to lower}} or {{eliminate}} the need for a septic tank to reduce their environmental footprint (particularly when the UDDT is used in conjunction with an on-site <b>greywater</b> treatment system).|$|E
25|$|Flush toilets may, if plumbed for it, use <b>greywater</b> (water {{previously}} {{used for}} washing dishes, laundry and bathing) for flushing rather than potable water (drinking water). Heads (on ships) are typically flushed with seawater.|$|E
25|$|Some water {{demanding}} activities do {{not require}} high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused {{with little or no}} treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where toilets can be flushed using <b>greywater</b> from baths and showers with little or no treatment.|$|E
25|$|Another variant is the pour-{{flush toilet}} (often {{a type of}} pit latrine). This type of flush toilet has no cistern, but is flushed {{manually}} with a few litres of a small bucket. This type of low-cost toilet is common in many Asian countries. It can use as little as 2–3 litres, and this can be <b>greywater</b> or rainwater.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the main}} health risk for potable use of {{reclaimed}} {{water is the}} potential for pharmaceutical and other household chemicals or their derivatives (Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants) to persist in this water. This would be less of a concern if human excreta was kept out of sewage by using dry toilets or systems that treat blackwater separately from <b>greywater.</b>|$|E
25|$|Microgeneration can be {{integrated}} {{as part of a}} self-sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems (permaculture and agroecosystem), rainwater harvesting, composting toilets or even complete <b>greywater</b> treatment systems. Domestic microgeneration technologies include: photovoltaic solar systems, small-scale wind turbines, micro combined heat and power installations, biodiesel and biogas.|$|E
25|$|Some home sewage {{treatment}} systems use biological treatment, usually beds {{of plants and}} aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert <b>greywater</b> and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water {{can be used to}} flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large aquarium.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the CIRS, UBC's new Student Union Building, which opened in summer 2015, was also {{designed}} to adhere to the most stringent sustainability requirements. It achieves the LEED Platinum standard – with features that include triple glazing, solar-powered cooling, solar water heaters, radiant heating and cooling in floors, green roof technology, water efficient landscaping that uses <b>greywater,</b> natural air ventilation, and a composting facility that processes up to 30 tonnes of organic waste each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparison}} of UDDTs with sewer-based sanitation systems (sewerage and wastewater treatment plants) {{is not as}} straightforward as the comparison with pit latrines as a sewer does not only deal with excreta management like a UDDT does, but it also transports <b>greywater,</b> municipal wastewater, stormwater and industrial wastewater. However, the installation of UDDTs in all households connected to a common sewer would result in vastly reduced volumes of water, nutrients and organic matter that arrive at the associated wastewater treatment plant.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to flush}} toilets {{connected}} to sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants, UDDTs are usually less expensive. However, to enable accurate comparisons of costs, {{this needs to}} be assessed on a case-by-case basis because the sewer system and treatment plant also transports and treats <b>greywater</b> whereas the UDDT does not. This means that the two systems provide a different level of service to the user. An example calculation for such a cost comparison exists for the case of Lima, Peru.|$|E
25|$|A {{green roof}} or living roof is a {{roof of a}} {{building}} that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Container gardens on roofs, where plants are maintained in pots, are not {{generally considered to be}} true green roofs, although this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat <b>greywater.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to large-scale solutions {{there are also}} several community-based approaches aiming at a more sustainable use of Jordan’s water resources. An important fosterer of these small-scale community-based approaches is the “Community Based Initiatives for Water Demand Management Project” (CBIWD), a project organised by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in cooperation with Mercy Corps, the Jordan River Foundation and the Royal Scientific Society which is supported by USAID. The CBIWD supports a variety of project types, among them e.g. rainwater harvesting and <b>greywater</b> reuse projects.|$|E
25|$|Since 1994, {{there is}} a {{significant}} move towards using less water for flushing flush toilets. This has resulted in the emergence of low flush toilet designs and local or national standards on water consumption for flushing. In addition, some people modify their existing high flush toilet to use less water by placing a brick or water bottle into the toilet's water tank. Other modifications are often done on the water system itself (such as by using <b>greywater),</b> or a system that pollutes the water less; hence more efficient use of the water is accomplished.|$|E
25|$|Transmission of {{pathogenic}} E. coli often occurs via fecal–oral transmission. Common {{routes of}} transmission include: unhygienic food preparation, farm contamination due to manure fertilization, irrigation of crops with contaminated <b>greywater</b> or raw sewage, feral pigs on cropland, or direct consumption of sewage-contaminated water. Dairy and beef cattle are primary reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7, {{and they can}} carry it asymptomatically and shed it in their feces. Food products associated with E. coli outbreaks include , raw ground beef, raw seed sprouts or spinach, raw milk, unpasteurized juice, unpasteurized cheese and foods contaminated by infected food workers via fecal–oral route.|$|E
25|$|Typically in {{developed}} countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though {{only a small}} proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other typical uses include washing, toilets, and irrigation. <b>Greywater</b> may {{also be used for}} toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks. Water may also be unacceptable due to levels of toxins or suspended solids. Reduction of waterborne diseases and development of safe water resources is a major public health goal in developing countries. Bottled water is sold for public consumption {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} made other {{infrastructure}} {{improvements to the}} downtown. In January 2012, a new edition of the Carlisle Street Parking Garage opened. It was built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards and was certified for its environmentally friendly features, including a green roof, preferred carpool and hybrid vehicle parking, <b>greywater</b> collection, permeable interlocking brick pavement, and several bike racks for users. A mixed-use development, the structure was planned for retail space at street level on Carlisle Street, {{in order to promote}} activity and business on the street. The project cost $27.9million, with funding split three ways between the federal, provincial and municipal governments.|$|E
25|$|Women {{preferred}} canal {{water to}} groundwater because canal water was softer {{and was not}} brackish. The surroundings of standpipes were dirty and the residents did not feel responsible to maintain them, seeing this as a responsibility of the government. Shallow wells were contaminated. There was no sewerage and no system to dispose <b>greywater.</b> Household latrines were used primarily by women. Men used sanitary facilities at mosques or defecated in canals. Children defecated openly in the streets or fields. Emptying of latrines was done by donkey carts or trucks which empty their load into canals. As a result of conditions like these infant mortality remained high despite the government's provision of water through standpipes.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} water used by {{conventional}} flush toilets usually makes up {{a significant portion of}} personal daily water usage. However, modern low flush toilet designs allow the use of much less water per flush. Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant {{amount of water}} over conventional units. The flush handle on these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. In some places, users are encouraged not to flush after urination. Flush toilets can be plumbed to use <b>greywater</b> (previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) rather than potable water (drinking water). Some modern toilets pressurize the water in the tank, which initiates flushing action with less water usage.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne's {{air quality}} is {{generally}} good and has improved significantly since the 1980s. Like many urban environments, the city faces significant environmental issues, {{many of them}} relating to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl {{and the demand for}} infrastructure and services. One such issue is the impact of drought on water supply. Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors on Melbourne's water supplies. During the Millennium drought, the Bracks Government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, <b>greywater</b> systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water saving and reuse initiatives. However, as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant, and the so-called North-South Pipeline from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria's north to Melbourne. Neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during 2010, and therefore both have been criticised as 'white elephants'.|$|E
25|$|Reducing water {{consumption}} and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of {{water consumption}} {{is that in}} many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout {{the life of a}} building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and <b>greywater</b> for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.|$|E
