(Or, {{in the case of the}} dog, just, well, murder her.) Without her, though, the show wouldn't be half as interesting. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes to accepting responsibility for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 7, 2008, {{during his}} press engagements to {{announce}} his reelection campaign, King made remarks about U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and his middle name [...] "Hussein", saying:I don't want to disparage anyone because of their race, their ethnicity, their name—whatever their religion their father might have been, I'll <b>just</b> say this: <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the optics of a Barack Obama potentially getting elected President of the United States - I mean, what does this look like {{to the rest of}} the world? What does it look like to the world of Islam? I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the al-Qaida, the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11.|$|R
40|$|Do {{you know}} that feeling? That feeling <b>when</b> the music <b>you</b> are {{listening}} to a concert or a new record and it <b>just</b> seems right? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> that’s it! That’s what music should sound like! When the music seems to touch your soul or mirror it, or…. something. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> feel that, nothing else seems to exist and you are purely experiencing the music. My thesis work explores {{the way in which}} we try to capture this ephemeral moment of pure experience in order to keep it with us to revisit at our leisure. This, however, is a futile endeavor. No matter how many photos you take, records you collect, or days of music on your iPod, that initial feeling, that visceral experience, cannot be replicated. In this work I use both materials that evoke this idea of the ephemeral (transparent plastic and glass) and materials are ephemeral themselves (water and wax) to convey the inability to capture music and the feelings it evokes in us. I have also chosen to add elements to the space, such as a wooden floor, stage lights, and fabric panels, to suggest a performance stage or sound studio and to further this connection to the music which the work was inspired by...|$|R
40|$|We were {{impressed}} by the paper of Demetter et al, which reports the accuracy of local pathologists' assessment of the grade of a rectal cancer specimen compared with a central panel of experts [1]. In the UK, the outcome measure for colorectal cancer used {{in the public domain}} is the 30 -day and 90 -day mortality rate. These figures represent the outcome of the patient following surgery, yet are influenced by the efforts of many members of the multi-disciplinary team and beyond, but identify only the operating surgeon [2]. Over the last decade several pathologists have reported the value of the specimen grade following rectal cancer surgery and this paper confirms the accuracy of the histopathologist in assessing the surgical ability to perform a total mesorectal excision [3]. Yet, this paper reminds us that pathologists have always been able to recognise good surgery as exemplified by the wise words of Cuthbert Dukes who in answer to a question posed at a meeting in New York in 1957 said "I should not chose the operation, but I should choose the surgeon who was to do it, and I should choose him with very great care. Then I should say to him, 'Do the operation <b>just</b> <b>when</b> and where <b>you</b> <b>think</b> is best, but please promise to go to bed the night before and get up in good time and have a good breakfast!' It would be a relief also to be assured that the operation would not be filmed or televised!" [4]. This leads us to the question, whether pathologists have always known who were the best surgeons and if so should they be informing the public? This article is protected by copyright.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E

At first, this dark amber spirit reads as light and sweet, from its distinct ripe apple and hazelnut notes to the light-bodied feel. But <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it's {{going to be a}} lightweight, there's surprising oomph on the finish, dry leather and clove notes that balance it out. This sippable whiskey would be great for whiskey sours and other cocktails. 93 points." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you have caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E

'Tis fighting in which there is little glory, and many hard knocks to be obtained; but it is a good school for war.
