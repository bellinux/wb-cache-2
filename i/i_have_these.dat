500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E
2500|$|There, Taylor started {{applying}} to colleges but soon descended into depression; his grades collapsed, he slept 20 hours each day, {{and he felt}} part of a [...] "life that [...] unable to lead." [...] In late 1965 he committed himself to the renowned McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, where he was treated with Thorazine and where the organized days began {{to give him a}} sense of time and structure. As the Vietnam War escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative. Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated Arlington School. He would later view his nine-month stay at McLean as [...] "a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve," [...] and both his brother Livingston and sister Kate would later be patients and students there as well. As for his mental health struggles, Taylor would think of them as innate and say: [...] "It's an inseparable part of my personality that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> feelings." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>these</b> ten years. Very often, {{night after}} night, my clothes will be {{wringing}} wet. There won't be a dry thread in my night-clothes and the sheets {{will be so}} that Mammy has to hang them up to dry! Eva doesn't sweat anything like that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> for you,' he continued. 'Your man Green {{was passing}} my grandmother's {{on his way}} back from Warborne, where he had been, he says, for any letters that had come for you by the evening post. As he stayed to assist the other men I told him I would go on to your house with the letters he had brought. Of course I did not tell him I should see you here.' ...|$|E

5000|$|As a child, Theron had {{suffered}} from jaundice {{and due to}} antibiotics her teeth had rotted away {{and had to be}} removed.

6000|$|A classmate named Stewart Snyder, a {{competent}} bulky {{young man in}} a gray flannel shirt, a rusty black bow tie, and the green-and-purple class cap, grumbled to her as they walked behind the others in the muck of the South St. Paul stockyards, [...] "These college chumps make me tired.

6000|$|... 'Well, as for that,' {{said the}} Count, 'I {{think there is}} {{something}} great in being ruined for one's friends. If I were as rich as I might have been, I would not spend much on myself. My wants are few; a fine house, fine carriages, fine horses, a complete wardrobe, the best opera-box, the first cook, and pocket-money; that is all I require. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these,</b> and I get on pretty well; but if I had a princely fortune I would make every good fellow I know quite happy.' ...|$|E
60|$|To {{make some}} amends, mes chères Mesdames, for {{dragging}} you {{on to this}} second sheet; and to relieve a little the tiresomeness of my unstudied and uncorrectible prose, I shall transcribe you some of my late poetic bagatelles; though <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>these</b> eight or ten months, done very little that way. One day, in a hermitage {{on the banks of}} Nith, belonging to a gentleman in my neighbourhood, who is so good as give me a key at pleasure, I wrote as follows; supposing myself the sequestered, venerable inhabitant of the lonely mansion.|$|E

The only one grain of comfort <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>these</b> many weeks,' he said, always {{speaking}} passionately, and, when most emphatic, repeating that former action of his hands, which was like flinging his heart's blood down before her in drops upon the pavement-stones; 'the only one grain of comfort <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>these</b> many weeks is, that I never did. For if <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> {{and if the}} same spell had come upon me for my ruin, I know <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> broken that tie asunder {{as if it had}} been thread.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Miss Heath was {{stopping}} {{in the home}} of a friend--a rather handsome house, in the midst of thick shrubbery; and they found her wrapped in a blanket and sitting on the porch in a steamer-chair, with Ben reading to her. They were both instant and cordial in their demands that the Captain alight and come in, and Ben went down the walk to get him, while Alice, with envious, wistful eyes answered the glowing girl: [...] "Oh no, I don't think the ride did me any harm. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> little back-sets now and then. I'm glad you came." ...|$|E
6000|$|Only in {{spirited}} engagements {{with his}} wife did these turbulent fears rise to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't understand why {{he did not want}} to [...] "drop in at the Littlefields'" [...] for the evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one to whom he could talk. [...] "Good Lord, Tinka is the only real friend <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>these</b> days," [...] he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with her all evening.|$|E

[...] When Proyas visited London to cast for the film, {{he met with}} O'Brien and found him suitable for the role.|$|R

You had better not say much - in fact, you had better be very careful not to say {{anything}} - about what your parents died of, or they might not like to take you in. Behave well, and I'll put you to school; O, yes! I'll put you to school, though I'm not obligated to do it.

60|$|Proud as {{they all}} {{certainly}} were, it was not pride, but dread, which kept them thus apart from their neighbors. The family had suffered for generations past from the horrible affliction of hereditary insanity, {{and the members of}} it shrank from exposing their calamity to others, as they must have exposed it if they had mingled with the busy little world around them. There is a frightful story of a crime committed in past times by two of the Monktons, near relatives, from which the first appearance of the insanity was always supposed to date, but it is needless for me to shock any one by repeating it. It is enough to say that at intervals almost every form of madness appeared in the family, monomania being the most frequent manifestation of the affliction among them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> particulars, and one or two yet to be related, from my father.|$|E
6000|$|... --when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> twelve ready, should I not {{do better}} {{to try to get}} a {{publisher}} for them, call them A Book of Stories and put a good dedicatory letter at the fore end of them. I should get less coin than by going into magazines perhaps; but I should also get more notice, should I not? and so, do better for myself in the long run. Now, should I not? Besides a book with boards is a book with boards, even if it bain't a very fat one and has no references to Ammianus Marcellinus and German critics at the foot of the pages. On all this, I shall want your serious advice. I am sure I shall stand or fall by the stories; and you'll think so too, when you see those poor excrescences the two John Knox and Women games. However, judge for yourself and be prudent on my behalf, like a good soul.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>these</b> pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to}} put together. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>these</b> sections, and <b>I</b> knew what order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|R
