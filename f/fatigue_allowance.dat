50|$|The <b>fatigue</b> <b>allowance</b> is {{intended}} to cover {{the time that the}} worker should be given to overcome fatigue due to work related stress and conditions. There are three factors that cause fatigue :(1) physical factor like standing and use of force (2) mental and cognitive factor like mental strain and eye strain (3) environmental and work factor like poor lighting, noise and heat.|$|E
40|$|In November 1953 a {{research}} project was started at the College of Aeronautics to study Work Study rating, rest and <b>fatigue</b> <b>allowances.</b> This project {{has been carried out}} under the sponsorship of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research with counterpart funds made avail¬able through the Conditional Aid Scheme. At the commencement of this project it was agreed that our special concern would be rest allowances and that we would consider rating only in so far as it became a necessary part of our study of rest allowances. This report is not intended to present results covering the whole of our investigations. The work carried out by. J. A, C. Williams who was any colleague in research until April, 1956 has been presented in previous reports and these are referred to in our list of references. Mr Williams has been especially concerned with the problem of heat stress and with the determination of a rational basis for Compensating Rest Allowances in relation to known heat loads. While this report cannot be regarded therefore as comprehensive it is hoped that for the general reader it will, however, cover sufficiently wide ground to justify some of the general conclusions that are reached {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fatigue}} design of steel {{catenary}} risers, {{there are concerns}} regarding the fatigue damage to girth welds from low stresses, below the constant amplitude fatigue limit, in the loading spectrum and the validity of Miner’s cumulative damage rule. These funda-mental issues were addressed in a recent joint-industrial project (JIP). A key feature was development of the resonance fatigue testing rigs {{to enable them to}} test full-scale pipes under variable amplitude loading. Such tests were performed under a loading spectrum representative of that experienced by some risers, with many tests lasting over 100 mil-lion cycles to investigate the fatigue damage due to small stresses as well as the validity of Miner’s rule. However, the resonance rigs are only capable of producing spectrum loading by gradually increasing or decreasing the applied load whereas more “spiky” random load sequences may be relevant in practice. Therefore, the program also included fatigue tests in conventional testing machines on strip specimens cut from pipes to com-pare the two types of loading sequence. This paper presents the results of these tests, con-clusions drawn, and recommendations for changes to current fatigue design guidance for girth welded pipes regarding the definition of the <b>fatigue</b> limit, <b>allowance</b> for the damag-ing effect of low stresses, and the validity of Miner’s rule.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} {{with examples of}} the productivity, the staffing required, the resultant productivity, and costs that can be obtained for hospital units that are subject to random work demands such as laboratory, radiology, physical therapy, and nuclear medicine. The methodology assumes that the hospital has a labor productivity system that produces the RVUs or earned hours of work accomplished daily by shift. Factors considered are {{the distribution of the}} capabilities of the work force, the <b>fatigue</b> and delay <b>allowances</b> of the work standards, the quality of the work standards, the maximum amount of overtime that people will be asked to work, staffing policies such as constant or different staffing levels for each day of the week, and worker selection processes. Predicted results are compared with present practice, which indicates that substantial cost reductions can occur {{with the use of the}} methodology...|$|R
