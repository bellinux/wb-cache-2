40|$|This {{paper is}} not for {{reproduction}} without permission of the author. In the context of globalization and risk management, knowledge and the virtual are key concepts that are poorly understood by decision makers and social theorists. This article refutes the OECD’s presumption that knowledge is an <b>intangible,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset,</b> by showing the importance of context, scale and the ‘virtuality ’ of knowledge in risk-management, communication, and knowledge management The article examines factors which maintain knowledge in a more fluid state. I begin with {{an examination of the}} rise of the notion of the ‘knowledge-based economy ’ and assumptions about the nature of knowledge as information- as a ‘thing ’ which can be accumulated and commodified as an asset This is followed by a discussion of the virtuality of knowledge, as opposed to actuality. Methods such as figure-ground are noted as possible approaches to the contexts of knowledge use. 1 THE CHANGING STATUS OF KNOWLEDGE Overwhelmed with information, we face a crisis of knowledge. Knowing and know-how, the strategic skill of manipulating information, is ironically in short supply.

40|$|A {{recommendation}} from the {{revision of the}} System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993 is to include R&D as an <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset.</b> This reflects the increasing role of knowledge in the economy. The definition of an asset within the National Accounts is to deliver benefit to the owner {{for more than a}} year; a characteristic that R&D and other non technical activities often demonstrate. The result on the production account of capitalising intangible investments is to increase the level of GDP whilst providing more detailed data on the sources of productivity growth. Net wealth is increased as stocks of intangible assets are recorded in the balance sheet; as these stocks are used up they provide capital services to the asset owner. Therefore in order to ‘capitalise’ intangible investment within a national accounts framework it is necessary not only to estimate the levels of stock but also {{the rate at which the}} stocks depreciate and become obsolete over time. That is, to estimate their service lives. The purposes of this study are: - to seek answers on asset lives, using a framework developed by the OECD; - to test whether companies can provide data on non-technical innovation activities, in addition to data provided on conventional R&D...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give some {{suggestions}} on the treatment of intangible assets in national accounting.

40|$|The {{accounting}} for <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> is, in many cases, a straightforward exercise, but it isn’t always {{so when it}} comes to the issue of <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and recognizing such assets on the balance sheet. IAS 38, In¬tan¬gi¬ble Assets, outlines the accounting re¬quire¬ments for in¬tan¬gi¬ble assets, which are non-mon¬e¬tary assets which are without physical substance and iden¬ti¬fi¬able (either being separable or arising from con¬trac¬tual or other legal rights). In¬tan¬gi¬ble assets meeting the relevant recog¬ni¬tion criteria are initially measured at cost, sub¬se¬quently measured at cost or using the reval¬u¬a¬tion model, and amortized on a sys¬tem¬atic basis over their useful lives (unless the asset has an in¬def¬i¬nite useful life, in which case it is not amortized). In today’s emerging economy of knowledge, even some banks have concluded that “soft” assets (like computer programming know-how and information infrastructure) can be a better credit risk than “hard” assets (like buildings). But how should the “soft assets” be valued? There are arguments that balance sheets ignore certain intangibles, but the reporting issues of trying to recognize them are, in my mind, insurmountable. It appears that the assets that really count are the ones accountants can’t count yet. This paper focuses on the nature, recognition and treatment of intangible assets, according the requirements International Financial reporting Standards.

40|$|In Romania {{there are}} several tens of billions lei in {{tangible}} assets {{in various stages of}} implementation and that are more or less subject to funding according to random criteria usually strictly related to political and electoral reasons. The big number of financial <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> generates considerable damage to the business environment which in such a critical period of the economic crisis has been its own cause – lack of cash. Certainly, the process may be difficult and in needs of professional solutions with regard to the complex and precise identification, the present value of these assets, the analysis of the opportunity to maintain or propose valuation, the resources that could be made circulate in the economic environment. Business can be stimulated by supporting robust investments and can be challenged by sale, lease or rental of in progress tangible assets that if completed, they would produce added value and would lead to a real value of public patrimony. Domestic and international economic conditions are conducive to such an approach while the Government and local authorities are required to carry out, in a concerted effort, a financial audit of all the <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and, {{on the basis of its}} findings, to adopt the most appropriate measures. Public investment resources within the existing budgetary constraints will hardly be available, but the return to the potential internal resources, available even in the State or local authority patrimony, could generate the necessary additional resources. The audit could support the use of these resources obtained once in investment areas of paramount importance for Romania and would supplement the existing resources.

40|$|With its Single Market Act (2012), the European Commission has {{identified}} twelve principal levers to boost growth, competitiveness and social progress. Two {{of them are}} intellectual property and financing of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SME), which the Commission considers to have the potential to give a new impetus to the Single Market. Intellectual property is a key element of the innovation policy of the enterprises. However, innovations and effective protection of intellectual property appear to be amongst the most serious problems of Bulgarian small and medium-sized enterprises. A research of the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, conducted this year in July, reveals that 53 % of the companies do not invest in innovations; Bulgaria holds the 93 rd place in the Global Competitiveness Index 2011 - 2012 among 139 countries and the 92 nd place in the Best Countries for Business 2012 ranking among 134 countries. Of considerable importance for the management of innovation activities of SMEs is the cognizance of the essence and scope of intellectual property accounting items, respectively intangible assets. Some of the prerequisites for the proper accounting treatment of this specific resource group are: good cognizance of the quality characteristics of separate groups of intangible assets; the development of classification and recognition criteria; the regulation of measurement bases; the regulation of accounting and disclosure requirements. In the light of the problematic issues outlined above, an effort was made in this paper to present some theoretical, practical and applied aspects with regard to: ? the potential and the role of intellectual property as a key element for the sustainable economic growth and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises; ? the identification of essential characteristics, scope and structure of the intellectual property of small and medium-sized enterprises for accounting purposes.

40|$|Recent {{international}} {{attempts to}} draft an accounting standard (IAS 38) which establishes {{the most widely}} acceptable treatment for intangible assets have sparked debate among standard setters, practising accountants and media analysts. Contentious issues include differing treatment for internally and externally generated <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> and the requirement {{for the existence of}} a ready market for the exchange of intangible assets. A further question has been identified, that of whether the ‘right to do something’, as in permission to act, is in itself an intangible asset and if so how should it be treated. An example of this is resource consents issued under the Resource Management Act 1991. The aim of this research was to investigate the nature of resource consents as intangible assets according to ICANZ disclosure and recognition standards and to determine the level of disclosure practised by companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Disclosure of resource consent details as non-financial information would provide a significant proportion of the benefits involved in disclosing this class of asset while limiting the costs involved in the production of the information. We conclude that the details of resource consents held should be disclosed in the annual report as additional non-financial information, or as a separate schedule of resource consents held in the notes to the financial statements as per FRS 1. This view is not addressed by the requirements of IAS 38 or ED 87 as this 'class of intangible assets' is not discussed at all. However, {{it can be argued that}} the omission of resource consents and other similar intangibles is contrary to the spirit of the true and fair view requirement of the Financial Reporting Act and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to analyse the factors motivating firms to follow a conservative (or low-leverage) financial policy over several years. We carry out a study on a sample of 1, 396 Spanish firms in the period 1993 - 2001. Using logit regression and various difference of means analyses, we test {{the influence of a}} number of variables associated with the pecking order theory, optimal capital structure theory and information asymmetries. Our findings show that conservative firms have a capital structure determined by the cash flows generated and their investment in tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> in accordance therefore with the pecking order theory. The findings do not provide support either for the optimal capital structure theory or for the role of information asymmetries, since in the majority of cases the results are not significant and/or contrary to what is predicted.

40|$|Share {{issues are}} a {{significant}} source of finance for non-financial corporations in Belgium. Between 1995 and 2005, they represented around 32 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations. Share issues are therefore the second most important source of finance, the first being non-bank credit, which accounts for 51 p. c. of the total. Share issues are a much more important source of funding than bank credit and issues of fixed-income securities. Unquoted shares represent the major part of this, namely 27 p. c., mainly because of the high level of foreign direct investment. Quoted shares represented only 5 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations during the period 1995 - 2005. An empirical analysis of the determinants of the capital structure highlights the fact that quoted companies having more <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> are more inclined to opt for equity financing. Conversely, other factors, such as the company’s debt level, size and internal resources have a negative influence on equity financing. The timing of the use of this type of financing depends partly on macroeconomic factors such as real and financial investments of the corporations. The cost of capital may also be regarded as a key determinant of the use of equity financing over time. Substantial issues were recorded during the period 1999 - 2001 and from mid 2005 onwards. These developments coincided with either a cost of capital well below its long-run average or a movement in the cost of capital which was more favourable than the price of alternative sources of finance. The recent government measure aimed at allowing the deduction of notional interest charges could also give a substantial boost to new share issues. capital structure, corporate finance, equities...|$|R
