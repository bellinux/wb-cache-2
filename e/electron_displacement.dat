In this context, individual electron spins {{have been identified as}} versatile quantum information carriers to interconnect different nodes of a spin-based semiconductor quantum circuit. Despite important experimental efforts to control the <b>electron</b> <b>displacement</b> over long distances, keeping the electron spin coherence after transfer remained up to now elusive. Here we demonstrate that individual electron spins can be displaced coherently over a distance of 5 micrometers. This displacement is realized on a closed path made of three tunnel-coupled lateral quantum dots. Using fast quantum dot control, the electrons tunnel from one dot to another at a speed approaching 100 m/s. We find that the spin coherence length is 8 times longer than expected from the electron spin coherence without displacement. Such an enhanced spin coherence points at a process similar to motional narrowing observed in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments 6. The demonstrated coherent displacement will enable long-range interaction between distant spin-qubits and will open the route towards non-abelian and holonomic manipulation of a single electron spin.

40|$|Light is {{composed}} of an electromagnetic field that can interact with the elementary charges in matter, whose response can in turn influence {{the behavior of the}} other light waves. When light passes through any material its electric field induces changes in the polarization of the material´s molecules. In “linear” materials the degree of <b>electron</b> <b>displacement,</b> characterized by the linear polarizability, is proportional to the strength of the applied electric field. The distinguishing characteristic of nonlinear optical colorants is that their polarization response to optical waves depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field strength. This can result in the emission of new radiation fields which are altered in phase, frequency, polarization or amplitude relative to the incident optical radiation. Many of these effects are sensitive to specific characteristics of the local optical properties and interfaces. Multi-photonic absorption can also result in electronic excitations that for a given incident light beam are more strongly localized in space than those resulting from linear absorption processes.

40|$|Transporting {{ensembles}} {{of electrons}} over long distances without losing their spin polarization {{is an important}} benchmark for spintronic devices. It requires usually to inject and to probe spin polarized electrons in conduction channels using ferromagnetic contacts or optical excitation. Parallel to this development, an important effort has been dedicated to the control of nanocircuits at the single electron level. The detection and the coherent manipulation of the spin of a single electron trapped in a quantum dot are now well established. Combined with the recent control of the displacement of individual electrons between two distant quantum dots, these achievements permit to envision the realization of spintronic protocols at the single electron level. Here, we demonstrate that spin information carried by one or two electrons can be transferred between two quantum dots separated by a distance of 4 micrometers with a classical fidelity of 65 %. We show that it is presently limited by spin flips occurring during the transfer procedure prior to and after the <b>electron</b> <b>displacement.</b> Being able to encode and control information in the spin degree of freedom of a single electron while being transferred over distances of a few microns on nanosecond timescales paves the way towards "quantum spintronics" devices where large scale spin-based quantum information processing could be implemented.

A few {{observations of the}} damage structures in cellularly decomposed Cu-Ti were also made. Results show that (a) metastable quenched solid solution Cu- 2 wt percent Co alloys, or the same alloys aged to produce coherent Co- rich zones, do not differ greatly from elemental Cu in their behavior under 1 MeV electron irradiation. When the same alloys are aged to form longer incoherent precipitate prior to HVEM irradiation, suppression of the early small loop stage of damage occurs but voids are nucleated in both cases; (b) metastable modulated microstructures in quenched or low temperature aged Cu- 4 wt percent Ti alloys completely surpressed void nucleation up to fluences {{on the order of}} 50 dpa. The very fine scale microstructural changes that occurred during irradiation in the modulated Cu- 4 wt percent Ti alloys were not resolved in detail, but it appears that the basic difference between Cu- 4 wt percent Ti and Cu- 2 wt percent Co was a much larger point defect sink density in the former, resulting in suppression of void nucleation. Since only one irradiation temperature was investigated, namely approximately 300 $sup 0 $C, these conclusions cannot be taken as a general statement concerning the merits of modulated structures with respect to radiation damage, but the results are encouraging.

40|$|A metal {{nanoparticle}} can {{be considered}} as consisting of a base of positive ion cores and a sea of free electrons. When the free electrons are displaced, for example, by an incident electric field, a restoring force acts on the electrons. The electrons may then oscillate back and forth until equilibrium is reached. This oscillation occurs at the natural frequency, or eigenfrequency, of the system. By matching the driving frequency with this frequency, the amplitude (the maximum <b>electron</b> <b>displacement)</b> can be made large - the system is in resonance. This resonance mode is a plasmon. The separation of charge on that small length scale will result in a large field {{in the vicinity of the}} nanoparticle. This large field, often oscillating at optical frequencies, on the spatial scale of nanometers, has many potential applications, such as high-resolution microscopy, photo-voltaics, light emission and coherent control. Because of the interest in manipulating light on the nanoscale, particles having their resonances in the optical domain are often used. The collective electron oscillation, when resonantly excited, therefore occurs on the femtosecond timescale. Due to this ultrashort timescale, the dynamics are difficult to follow in time. The spatial confinement of the oscillation to the nanometer scale makes it challenging to also image them. This thesis explores ways of studying the ultrafast dynamics of plasmons spatially and temporally, simultaneously. Two types of experiments are discussed. The first is autocorrelation experiments where the induced and enhanced field is autocorrelated with itself. For one of these experiments, bowtie nanoantennas were manufactured, using the focused ion beam technique.

Various processes occurring in the penetration of highly charged ions through solids is still attracting attention of various areas as atomic collision physics and dynamical chaology [2, 3]. Chaotic nature of the projectile electron scattering process in the motion of highly charged ions in the solid makes this system an interesting object both classical and quantum chaology. The interaction of the fast {{charged particle}}s with an electron gas causes a coherent <b>electron</b> <b>displacement.</b> This feature of a strongly anisotrophic distribution of the dynamical screening charge dates back to Bohr [6], who referred to this phenomenon as "wake " behind the charged particle. An explicit expression for the wake was first given by Neufelf and Ritchie [7 - 9]. The "wake " shows a series of domains with alternately enhanced and depleted electron density relative to the mean density of the medium. Accordingly, the electrostatic potential ("wake potential") exhibits in addition to a monotonic decay as a function of distance an oscillatory feature: domains of enhancement create regions of negative electric potential, whereas density depletion gives rise to a positive potential [4]. In this work we investigate the chaotization problem by solving the relativistic Hamiltonian equation of motion which include two types of relativistic motion: the relativistic motion of heavy ion and relativistic motion of ion's electrons. The phase-space portrait of the considered system is plotted. Thus the system to be considered is electron moving in the field of two potentials: the Coulomb potential V 0 and dynamical screening potential V 1 produced by the displaced electron density.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a systematic characterization of pure hydrogen capacitively coupled discharges, produced {{in a parallel}} plate cylindrical setup. A two-dimensional, time-dependent fluid model is {{used to describe the}} production, transport, and destruction of electrons and positive ions H+,H 2 +, and H 3 +, at different frequencies(13. 56 - 60 MHz), pressures (0. 2 - 8 Torr), rf applied voltages (50 - 450 V) and geometric dimensions (1. 6 - 12. 8 cm radii and 1. 6 - 6. 4 cm interelectrode distances). A good agreement is found between calculation results and experimental measurements for the coupled electrical power, the plasma potential, and the self-bias potential, at various frequencies and rf applied voltages. However, the model generally underestimates the electron density with respect to its measured values. The paper discusses different space-time events, such as the development of double-ionization structures or the occurrence of field inversion and field reversal phenomena. The dependencies on pressure and frequency of the time-average electric field distribution are analyzed and related to the <b>electron</b> <b>displacement</b> within space-charge sheaths. This study is later used to understand the variations of the hydrogen dissociation rate, with changes in discharge operating conditions. The influence of reactor dimensions on the spatial profiles of the plasma potential, the rf electric field, the electron density, and the electron mean energy are analyzed in terms of discharge symmetry. An investigation of the space-time averaged rf electric field variations, with changes in the applied voltage, pressure, and geometric dimensions is carried out. These variations are shown to follow a universal similarity curve, if an adequate normalization is used when plotting the rf electric field as a function of pressure. This innovative representation of rf discharges allows a univocal definition of a reactor working point, for given operating conditions. Portugal.
