50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is a device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light. The beam may be carried over free space, or propagated through an optical waveguide (optical fibre). Depending on the parameter of a light beam which is manipulated, modulators may be categorized into amplitude modulators, phase modulators, polarization modulators etc. Often the easiest way to obtain modulation of intensity of a light beam, is to modulate the current driving the light source, e.g. a laser diode. This sort of modulation is called <b>direct</b> <b>modulation,</b> as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason light modulators are, e.g. in fiber optic communications, called external light modulators.|$|E
50|$|MPST is {{expressed}} {{in a number of}} tissues, including kidney, liver, lung,heart, muscle, spleen and brain. H2S is produced from l-cysteine by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and MPST. l-cysteine-dependent production of H2S by MPST is a two-step reaction. In the first step, cysteine aminotransferase converts l-cysteine along with α-ketoglutarate into 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP). Subsequently, MPST converts 3-MP into H2S. MPST catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from mercaptopyruvate to sulfur acceptors like cyanides or thiol compounds. Thus it is also considered to participate in cysteine degradation. MPST generates H2S in coronary artery, mediating its effects through <b>direct</b> <b>modulation</b> of NO, namely vasodilation. This has important implications for H2S-based therapy in healthy and diseased coronary arteries.|$|E
50|$|The first {{movement}} is in traditional sonata-allegro form. The first subject, a long, lyrical cantabile line in D minor, is stated sotto voce by the violin with the piano providing a simple accompaniment; off-beats {{in the right}} hand provide a quietly agitated character. Immediately after the violin's closing cadence ends the first statement of the first subject, the subject is {{taken up by the}} piano, subito forte and with a virtuosic, heroic character; now it is the violin's turn to provide an accompaniment, again in syncopated rhythm. The second subject, a romantic, expressive melody in F major, is then stated by the piano alone, and repeated by the violin with a simple arpeggiated piano accompaniment. Next comes the development section: the violin plays a variant of the first subject elaborated with bariolage bowing, while the piano again provides the accompaniment in the right hand. Of particular interest in this section is the pedal point on the dominant (A) which the pianist sustains in the left hand for the entire duration of the development section. The recapitulation begins with the violin restating the first subject as in the beginning but an octave lower, the piano plays an elaborated version of the original accompanying figure. After the final cadence of the subject, three sudden unison chords announce, subito forte, an unexpected <b>direct</b> <b>modulation</b> into F-sharp minor. In the ensuing section, of virtuosic and symphonic character, violin and piano toss back and forth fragments of the original theme. After a <b>direct</b> <b>modulation</b> back to D minor, the recapitulation resumes its course, and then the second subject is restated in D major. Once more back into D minor and the first subject makes one more appearance in the violin, in the original octave, accompanied by the original figure in the piano. There is a brief sotto voce return to the elaborated material of the development section which then passes through a series of modulations. One final sostenuto statement of the first subject across three octaves leads to a cadence in D major, which leads directly into the second movement.|$|E
