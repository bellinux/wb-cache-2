5|$|Despite being {{regarded}} {{by many as}} highly prestigious, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> having an album nominated for or winning the Mercury Prize could be a curse on a career in music.|$|E
5|$|In astrobiology, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{discrete}} vanadium accumulations on Mars {{could be}} a potential microbial biosignature, when {{used in conjunction with}} Raman spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Ottawa {{speakers}} {{were among}} the groups that used the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, a syllabic writing system derived from a European-based alphabetic orthography, but supporting evidence is weak.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Schongauer's pupil Urbain Huter (1471–1501) {{may have}} been one of the authors but without any solid evidence.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as an {{antitumour}} agent, {{due to its}} {{suppression of}} FGF2.|$|R
2500|$|In 1925, Sax Rohmer's Yellow Shadows was {{published}} which featured a Chinese villain {{by the name}} of [...] "Burma Chang", which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>was</b> based on Brilliant Chang.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as {{the cause}} of a case of meningoencephalitis in a dog.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the data}} leak could cost {{the law firm}} up to £500,000 in fines for {{breaching}} British Data Protection Laws.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the giant}} or {{waterfall}} swiftlet, Hydrochous gigas, which cannot echolocate, may be descended from an echolocating ancestor.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{original}} function of lactation (milk production) {{was to keep}} eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{based on}} {{localization}} studies that IFT proteins also function outside of cilia.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{the legend}} <b>was</b> resurrected in the 19th century to frighten freed slaves.|$|R

5|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{refers to a}} womanizing man. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the lyrics address Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the criminal trial}} {{could be used as}} a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Due to the English Water Spaniel's colours {{of liver}} (tan) and white, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the breed {{may have been}} the source of the colours now found in the modern English Springer Spaniel and Welsh Springer Spaniel breeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> the {{feathered}} dinosaur Microraptor glided, {{and perhaps}} even flew, on four wings, which were held in a biplane-like arrangement. This {{was made possible by}} the presence of flight feathers on both the forelimbs and hindlimbs of Microraptor, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> the earliest flying ancestors of birds may have possessed this morphology, with the monoplane arrangement of modern birds evolving later.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{the square}} on the charioteer's chest is a {{representation}} of the earth tattva.|$|R

5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} make them capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Channel 4's Time Team {{undertook}} excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed {{evidence of}} a medieval hall {{to the east of}} the castle; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the hall was used as a dining area.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> by some {{scholars}} {{that the modern}} popular garden gnome is a descendant of Priapus.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> by {{scholars}} that the [...] "gifts" [...] were medicinal rather than precious material for tribute.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> by Comyns Beaumont {{that the}} Orphic mysteries {{may have had}} their origins with the Cabeiri.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> a {{proportionality}} analysis better safeguards equality {{compared to}} the American three-tiered scrutiny approach. The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{life could}} {{exist in the}} lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with {{acetylene}} instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> on some lines {{variable}} gauge axles would achieve significant time savings {{in comparison to}} bogie exchange. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either retrofitting or replacement of existing bogies.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{by early}} 20th century Armenologists that Armani is the {{earliest}} {{form of the}} name Armenia.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{to build}} {{football}} helmets with accelerometers {{in order to}} measure the impact of head collisions.|$|R
