2500|$|<b>Eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> is {{the removal}} of one or both eyestalks from a crustacean. It is {{routinely}} practiced on female prawns in almost every marine shrimp maturation or reproduction facility in the world, both research and commercial. The aim of ablation is to stimulate the female shrimp to develop mature ovaries and spawn. [...] In Macrobrachium americanum, prawns treated with lignocaine (a local anaesthetic in mammals), showed less rubbing, flicking and sheltering than those without the anaesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted theory of why eye ablation reduces this inhibition {{is that a}} gonad inhibitory hormone (GIH) is produced in the neurosecretory complexes in the eyestalk. This hormone occurs in nature in the non-breeding season and is absent or present only in low concentrations during the breeding season. The reluctance of most shrimp to routinely develop mature ovaries in captivity {{is a function of}} elevated levels of GIH, and <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> lowers the high haemolymph titer of GIH. The effect of <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> is not on a single hormone such as GIH, but rather affects several physiological processes. Besides the GIH evidence, another hypothesis suggests that <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> also reduces light intensity and thereby induces ovarian maturation. In the banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, syn. Penaeus merguiensis), dim light favours ovarian maturation and spawning. [...] The exact mechanism of <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> on the ovarian maturation is not conclusive.|$|E
50|$|Most captive {{conditions}} for shrimp cause inhibitions in females that {{prevent them from}} developing mature ovaries. Even in conditions where a given species will develop ovaries and spawn in captivity, use of <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> increases total egg production and increases the percentage of females in a given population that participate in reproduction. Once females {{have been subjected to}} <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation,</b> complete ovarian development often ensues within as little as 3 to 10 days.|$|E
40|$|Examinations {{were carried}} out with the <b>eyestalks</b> <b>ablation</b> and under 2 {{different}} feed conditions to clarify a physiological relationship of the PAS-cells, treated previously, with the gonad or the midgut gland of the prawn, Penaeus japonicas B [...] The 4 indexes such as, the GSI (gonadosomatic index), the MSI (midgut gland-somatic index), the MR (dry-wet ratio of the midgut gland) and the quantity of the PAS-positive substance in the PAS-cells were calculated on each specimen respectively, and were compared each other after the experiments. Under the normal feed condition, the distinct increase of the GSI {{was caused by the}} <b>eyestalks</b> <b>ablation</b> with 20 days keeping. Its highest value was 7. 3 %, and the values of the non-operated were 0. 2 %. The increase of the GSI was observed, too, in the operated ones under the few feed. It suggests that the eyestalks inflict a very powerful suppression to the gonadal maturation. Under the few feed, the MSI and the MR showed, both in the operated and the non-operated, the decreasing tendencies according to days. Their normal values were MSI= 3 - 4 % and MR= 0. 2 - 0. 3 ．It suggests that the nutritional substances in the midgut gland would be consumed rather than the other body constituents. On the otherhand, the substance in the PAS-cells showed no quantitative variation according to the above operations. It seems, therefore, that the PAS-cells have no direct relationship with the weight of the gonad or of the midgut gland. ...|$|R
40|$|Examinations {{were carried}} out to clarify the {{physiological}} relationship of the heart beat and the scaphognathite ventilation with the PAS-cells, located on the ventro-posterior of the supraoesophageal ganglion of the prawn, Penaeus japonicas B [...] For {{the heart and the}} scaphognathite the frequencies of each beat were counted at regular intervals (1, 3, 6 and 10 hrs.) after <b>eyestalks</b> <b>ablation.</b> After counting, the ganglions were fixed histologically and the PAS-positive granules in the cells were calculated quantitatively by transcription method as previously. Generally the ranges of the required times for 100 beats within 10 hrs. after the operation were 8 ~ 60 sec. and 10 ~ 69 sec. to the heart and the scaphognathite respectively (water temp. 22. 5 ~ 26. 0 °C). As a result, no correlation was observed between the quantity of the substance and the changes of both activities. Therefore it seems that the PAS-cells have no physiological role on the heart beat or the ventilation. ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{hatcheries}} in {{the developing}} countries still depend on wild seed, maturation can be induced by <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> technique where eyestalks of females are unilaterally ablated to stimulate endocrine activity. The ablated females spawn after 4 days, with a peak observed at days 5-6. However it is expensive to raise spawners in captivity and ablated shrimps result in less hardy fry with low survival rate. Even though the fecundity of the ablated females may not differ significantly, the hatch rates of ablated females {{was found to be}} markedly less (37.8% to 58.1%) than that of unablated females (69.2%). It is also found that wild females are more fecund per unit weight than ablated females. However quantitatively the number of spawns, eggs and nauplii produced by ablated females is ten, eight and six times respectively that of unablated females.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of the {{capacity}} for invertebrates to experience nociception and pain has been widely studied in crustaceans. In the crab Neohelice granulata, electric shocks delivered via small holes in the carapace elicited a defensive threat display. Injection of morphine reduced the crabs' sensitivity to the shock in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect declining with increasing duration between morphine injection and shock. Naloxone injection inhibited the effects of morphine, as is seen in vertebrates. Morphine also had inhibitory effects on the escape tail-flick response to electric shock in the mantis shrimp, Squilla mantis, that was reversed by naloxone, indicating that the effect is found in crustacean groups other than decapods. When the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide were applied to the antennae of grass prawns, Penaeus monodon, {{there was an increase}} in rubbing and grooming of the treated areas which was not seen if they had previously been treated with a local anaesthetic, benzocaine, however, the benzocaine did not eliminate the level of rubbing seen in response to mechanical stimulation with forceps. There was no effect of benzocaine on the general locomotion of the prawns, so the reduction in rubbing and grooming was not simply due to inactivity of the animal.

In addition to reproduction, other physiological and metabolic processes are affected by removal of the X-organ sinus gland complex located in the eyestalk. In this study, the effect of unilateral and bilateral <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> on the concentration of several hemolymph metabolites and phenoloxidase system in female and male shrimp was investigated. As a consequence of reducing or suppressing moltinhibiting hormone (MIH) production, the duration of the molting cycle was significantly shorter in eyestalkablated shrimp: bilaterally (10 days), unilaterally (17 days), and shrimp that were not ablated (24 days). Mortality was significantly higher in unilaterally (35 %) and bilaterally (68 %) ablated shrimp than in untreated shrimp (2 %), probably caused by impairment of several physiological functions mediated by hormones from the eyestalk and direct injury of the nervous system. Males and females were affected differently by <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> in terms of concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, and protein in hemolymph. Glucose and lactate levels were lower in bilaterally ablated shrimp, as expected by the role of crustacean hyperglycemic hormona in glucose metabolism.

Prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities were significantly lower in bilaterally, but not in unilaterally ablated shrimp.

40|$|Penaeid prawns M. dobsoni of two {{different}} size ranges were ablated both unilaterally (UEA) and bilaterally (BEA) and subjected to individual study. The UEA prawns consumed almost {{the same amount of}} food as the control prawns in the size group, 35 - 40 mm. but consumed about 57. 8 % more food than the control prawns in the larger size group, 48 - 53 mm. Growth was estimated as length and weight changes and significant variation was observed. The moult rate and dry moult weight showed marked differences. Average intermoult period increases with second ablation. Dry weight of moult in every suc-ceeding moult was found to decrease irrespective of the level of ablation. Unilateral <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> resulted in increase in dry weight whereas bilateral <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> reduced the dry weight of moult and this decrease in the rate increased after each subsequent moult.

Both wild-caught and pond-reared females repeatedly spawned after <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation.</b> On average, each wild-caught female spawned 2. 94 times while each pond-reared female spawned only 1. 09 times. The spawning induction rate, egg hatching rate, {{and the number of}} eggs per spawning were significantly greater in wild-caught females than in pond-reared females. However, the egg size was not significantly different between wild-caught and pond-reared females. Four shrimp sizes (60, 80, 100 and 120 (+/- 1. 0) g) were tested in this study and body weight significantly affected ovarian induction in pond-reared females but not in wild-caught females.

40|$|Ovarian {{maturation}} in crustaceans is temporally {{orchestrated by}} two processes: oogenesis and vitellogenesis. The peptide hormone vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH), {{by far the}} most potent negative regulator of crustacean reproduction known, critically modulates crustacean ovarian maturation by suppressing vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis. In this study, cDNA encoding VIH was cloned from the eyestalk of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, a highly significant commercial culture species. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that L. vannamei VIH (lvVIH) can be classified {{as a member of the}} type II crustacean hyperglycemic hormone family. Northern blot and RT-PCR results reveal that both the brain and eyestalk were the major sources for lvVIH mRNA expression. In in vitro experiments on primary culture of shrimp hepatopancreatic cells, it was confirmed that some endogenous inhibitory factors existed in L. vannamei hemolymph, brain, and eyestalk that suppressed hepatopancreatic VTG gene expression. Purified recombinant lvVIH protein was effective in inhibiting VTG mRNA expression in both in vitro primary hepatopancreatic cell culture and in vivo injection experiments. Injection of recombinant VIH could also reverse ovarian growth induced by <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation.</b> Furthermore, unilateral <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> reduced the mRNA level of lvVIH in the brain but not in the remaining contralateral eyestalk.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{understand}} the regulation mechanism of <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> {{on the activities}} of hepatopancreas, Illumina RNA-Seq and digital gene expression (DGE) analyses were performed to investigate the transcriptome of the eyestalk, Y-organ, and hepatopancreas of E. sinensis and to identify the genes associated with the hepatopancreas metabolism that are differentially expressed under <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> conditions. RESULTS: A total of 58, 582 unigenes were constructed from 157, 168 contigs with SOAPdenovo. A BlastX search against the NCBI Nr database identified 21, 678 unigenes with an E-value higher than 10 ⁻⁵. Using the BLAST 2 Go and BlastAll software programs, 6, 883 unigenes (11. 75 % of the total) were annotated to the Gene Ontology (GO) database, 7, 386 (12. 6 %) unigenes were classified into 25 Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COGs), 16, 200 (27. 7 %) unigenes were assigned to 242 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and 1, 846 unigenes were matched to "metabolism pathways". The DGE analysis revealed that 1, 416 unigenes were significantly differentially expressed in the hepatopancreas, of which 890 unigenes were up-regulated and 526 unigenes were down-regulated. Of the differentially expressed genes, 382 unigenes were annotated and 63 were classified into metabolism pathways. The results of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of four unigenes related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistent with those obtained from the DGE analysis, which demonstrates that the sequencing data were satisfactory for further gene expression analyses.

The eggs released by a spawner without <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> were raised upto juveniles through rearing in the hatchery, nursery cement tanks and in earthern ponds. The hatching rate and subsequent survival rate from nauplius- 1 to PL- 1 was 92. 3 and 53. 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>eyestalk</b> <b>ablation</b> and eyestalk extract {{injection}} on oxygen consumption of Ocypode macrocera were studied on 30 specimens {{over a period}} of 10 -days. Statistical analysis of the results show significant differences between stalked and destalked animals as well as stalked and eyestalk extract injected ones. Oxygen consumed in destalked animals was higher than in stalked ones, whereas oxygen consumed by eyestalk extract injected animals was lesser than stalked ones. The differences were discussed on the hormonal basis...|$|E
