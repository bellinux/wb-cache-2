50|$|Three {{years after}} her husband died, Emily Spengler (Faith Ford), a 2nd grade teacher in the small Washington town of South Woodbourne is {{preparing}} {{for the arrival of}} her daughter, Heather (Emma Lahana), who is attending school at Boston College. When she comes to find out that her daughter wishes to do other things for Christmas, she calls her friend, Faith Kerrigan (Gabrielle Miller), for advice. Faith is a divorced event planner based in San Francisco. Meanwhile, in Boston, Charles Johnson (Tom Cavanagh), an English professor and writer is working on the <b>finishing</b> <b>draft</b> for his latest novel. He is struggling to finish his book after missing several deadlines, and so his brother, Ray Johnson (Gil Bellows), who is the owner of a software security company, suggests he get away and find some place to concentrate on his writing. Meanwhile, in Washington, Emily decides to surprise her daughter in Boston, although she is unaware that her daughter has already made plans to go with her boyfriend, Jason (Andrew Francis), to Phoenix, Arizona and stay at the home of his grandparents.|$|E
40|$|Historically, cholera {{outbreaks}} {{have been}} linked to V. cholerae O 1 serogroup strains or its derivatives of the O 37 and O 139 serogroups. A genomic study on the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak strains highlighted the putative role of non O 1 /non-O 139 V. cholerae in causing cholera and the lack of genomic sequences of such strains from around the world. Here we address these gaps by scanning a global collection of V. cholerae strains as a first step towards understanding the population genetic diversity and epidemic potential of non O 1 /non-O 139 strains. Whole Genome Mapping (Optical Mapping) based bar coding produces a high resolution, ordered restriction map, depicting a complete view of the unique chromosomal architecture of an organism. To assess the genomic diversity of non-O 1 /non-O 139 V. cholerae, we applied a Whole Genome Mapping strategy on a well-defined and geographically and temporally diverse strain collection, the Sakazaki serogroup type strains. Whole Genome Map data on 91 of the 206 serogroup type strains support the hypothesis that V. cholerae has an unprecedented genetic and genomic structural diversity. Interestingly, we discovered chromosomal fusions in two unusual strains that possess a single chromosome instead of the two chromosomes usually found in V. cholerae. We also found pervasive chromosomal rearrangements such as duplications and indels in many strains. The majority of Vibrio genome sequences currently in public databases are unfinished draft sequences. The Whole Genome Mapping approach presented here enables rapid screening of large strain collections to capture genomic complexities {{that would not have been}} otherwise revealed by unfinished draft genome sequencing and thus aids in assembling and <b>finishing</b> <b>draft</b> sequences of complex genomes. Furthermore, Whole Genome Mapping allows for prediction of novel V. cholerae non-O 1 /non-O 139 strains that may have the potential to cause future cholera outbreaks...|$|E

60|$|The <b>finished</b> <b>draft,</b> Mathilda, still shows Mary Shelley's faults as a writer: verbosity, loose plotting, {{somewhat}} stereotyped and extravagant characterization. The reader must be {{tolerant of}} its heroine's overwhelming lamentations. But she is, after all, {{in the great}} tradition of romantic heroines: she compares her own weeping to that of Boccaccio's Ghismonda over the heart of Guiscardo. If the reader can accept Mathilda on her own terms, he will find not only biographical interest in her story but also intrinsic merits: a feeling for character and situation and phrasing that is often vigorous and precise.|$|R

50|$|Though {{the film}} has been noted for its semi-humorous screenplay, it was adapted from a more {{straightforward}} novel by Gary Brandner which {{was first published in}} 1977. After drafts by Jack Conrad (the original director who left following difficulties with the studio) and Terence H. Winkless proved unsatisfactory, director Joe Dante hired John Sayles to completely rewrite the script. The two had collaborated before on Dante's 1978 film Piranha. Sayles rewrote the script with the same self-aware, satirical tone that he gave Piranha, and his <b>finished</b> <b>draft</b> bears only a vague resemblance to Brandner's book.
