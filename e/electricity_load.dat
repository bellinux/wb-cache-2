500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS {{study is}} that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times of}} the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between <b>electricity</b> <b>load</b> management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} hybrid {{approach}} for the modeling and the short-term forecasting of <b>electricity</b> <b>loads.</b> Two {{building blocks of}} our approach are (1) modeling the overall trend and seasonality by fitting a generalized additive model to the weekly averages of the load and (2) modeling the dependence structure across consecutive daily loads via curve linear regression. For the latter, a new methodology is proposed for linear regression with both curve response and curve regressors. The key idea behind the proposed methodology is dimension reduction based on a singular value decomposition in a Hilbert space, which reduces the curve regression problem to several ordinary (i. e., scalar) linear regression problems. We illustrate the hybrid method using French <b>electricity</b> <b>loads</b> between 1996 and 2009, on which we also compare our method with other available models including the Électricité de France operational model.

2500|$|Most {{emission}} analysis use average emissions rates across regions {{instead of}} marginal generation {{at different times}} of the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009, and used the specifications for the Chevrolet Volt (all-electric range of [...] ). The analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the Upper Midwest compared to the Western U.S., and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others. Applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles, the NBER researchers found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between <b>electricity</b> <b>load</b> management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand. This pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the liberalisation of the electricity markets in Europe, market players have to continuously adapt their future supply to match their customers' demands. This poses the challenge of obtaining a predictive model that accurately describes <b>electricity</b> <b>loads,</b> current in this thesis. Kernel machines are considered to be {{the state of the art}} of supervised learning methods. A Bayesian-framework based kernel-machine is extended to represent data in a way that is sparse in feature space and smooth in output space. It is argued that this leads to a higher degree of generalisation. Kernel machines can be tailored to better suit one's demands; electricity-demand-specific representations are designed for day types and for emphasising twilight periods. A multi-component setup is proposed to increase the orthogonality between input variables. For wind-power production forecasting, data from several weather stations is combined to refine the coarse resolution of wind-speed measurements. To put theory into practice, the kernel-machine library has been developed. It offers its users efficiency and flexibility. All proposed representations are implemented and tested for their embeddability in a real-world environment. The multi-component structureis filled with calendar, trend, temperature, radiation, and wind components. These components enable the electricity demands to be unravelled; several new explicit facts are discovered, such as the influence of Sinterklaas and a cloudburst.
