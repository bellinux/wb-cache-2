The mural depicts a variety of technological and societal themes (such as the discoveries made possible by microscopes and telescopes) and was controversial for its inclusion of Lenin and a Soviet May Day parade. The Rockefellers were not happy with the painting and the incomplete work was eventually destroyed and painted over. Rivera recreated <b>it</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1934. On {{the north side of the}} third floor are David Alfaro Siqueiros' three-part La Nueva Democracía (New Democracy) and Rivera's four-part Carnaval de la Vida Mexicana (Carnival of Mexican Life); to the east is José Clemente Orozco's La Katharsis (Catharsis), depicting the conflict between humankind's 'social' and 'natural' aspects.|$|E
500|$|A [...] fastball {{from the}} Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 2016, struck Holliday {{on the right}} thumb, {{fracturing}} it. [...] The Cardinals placed him on the DL. [...] Presented with the option to either allow the thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end. [...] He encountered multiple delays in recovery. [...] Having been informed {{in the final days}} of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against Pittsburgh. [...] He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 20th of the season. [...] Holliday released a statement: [...] "While I'm disappointed this could be <b>it</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis, I understand that it might be time to move on." [...] While his batting average had dropped to a career-low [...]246, Holliday was optimistic about a rebound. [...] Because he produced the third-highest exit velocity at [...] of all hitters with at least 100 batted balls in 2016, he concluded that to [...] "have my misses be more in the air than on the ground, my numbers could really get back toward where they have been my whole career." ...|$|E

In his second season, he scored 11 goals and began to garner attention throughout the league. Mallorca President Mateo Alemany said of his style of play, [...] "I doubt if there is any other player in the world who would please the fans more at this moment." [...] Eto'o himself commented on his rise to stardom, [...] "I like <b>it</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Mallorca; I have always been well looked after, the fans appreciate me and I also have a contract that runs until 2007." [...] He returned the fans' appreciation when he donated €30,000 in meals to travelling Mallorca supporters who made the journey to the Copa del Rey final against Recreativo de Huelva in 2003.
