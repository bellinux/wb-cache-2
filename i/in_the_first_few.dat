5|$|Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} in newborn infants with breathing difficulties is difficult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks. However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, blood tests and x-rays {{may be used}} to confirm {{bronchopulmonary dysplasia}}. In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E

5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} the {{primordial}} Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{tens of millions of}} years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.|$|E
50|$|Econometrica was {{established}} in 1933. Its first editor was Ragnar Frisch, recipient of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969, who served as an editor from 1933 to 1954. Although Econometrica is currently published entirely <b>in</b> English, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> issues also contained scientific articles written in French.|$|R
50|$|Camp on San Pedro River and Camp Wright, 1865. The Fort was re-constructed {{starting}} <b>in</b> 1865. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{months of}} construction was {{undertaken by the}} 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry commanded by Colonel Thomas F.

50|$|Directions to Servants is a satirical and humorous {{essay by}} Jonathan Swift. Swift {{is known to}} have been working on it in 1731, though it was not {{published}} until after his death <b>in</b> 1745. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> chapters are much more developed than the later ones, and it appears that the work was unfinished and uncorrected at Swift's death.|$|R
5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led {{to the death of}} innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> cases, marginally) better times {{than the best}} time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), {{so it is a}} good place for beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days. Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest suspension bridge (Punakha Suspension Bridge) and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter {{than he would have}} liked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the figure}} to the right, the enzyme {{produces}} E* rapidly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{seconds of the}} reaction. The rate then slows as steady state is reached. This rapid burst phase of the reaction measures a single turnover of the enzyme. Consequently, the amount of product released in this burst, shown as the intercept on the y-axis of the graph, also gives the amount of functional enzyme which {{is present in the}} assay.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles {{that would be}} of interest to accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{decades of}} the twentieth century, American {{paleontologist}} E. C. Case authored many studies on Dimetrodon and described several new species. He received funding from the Carnegie Institution for his study of many Dimetrodon specimens in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and several other museums. Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not been thoroughly described, as Cope was known for erecting new species on the basis of only a few bone fragments.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the Allen {{brothers}} and high economic interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town, <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years of Houston's existence were plagued by yellow fever epidemics, flooding, searing heat, inadequate infrastructure, and crime. Houston suffered from woefully inadequate city services; the Allens failed to accommodate transit, water service, sewerage, road paving, trash service, or gas service in their plans. As a result, <b>in</b> 1839 <b>the</b> Texas Capitol was moved to Austin.|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{weeks of}} 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn {{made it difficult}} for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{years after}} publication, German readers widely {{assumed that the}} real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
