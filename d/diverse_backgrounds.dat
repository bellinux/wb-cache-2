5|$|Figures for troops {{involved}} in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They {{should be treated}} with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army {{was a combination of}} warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000-50,000. Along with the core of an estimated 8,000 Libyans, there were 8,000 Iberians, 16,000 Gauls (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and around 5,500 Gaetulian infantry. Hannibal's cavalry also came from <b>diverse</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had around 8,000 skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers and mixed-nationality spearmen. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.|$|E

Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of cognitive function in individuals of culturally and linguistically <b>diverse</b> <b>background</b> poses considerable {{challenges for the}} psychologist, particularly when English proficiency is limited. This study explored the effects of <b>diverse</b> cultural <b>background</b> and non-Western educational background on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third edition (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III) performances in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury within an outpatient rehabilitation setting. Participants were aged 16 – 65 years and met careful selection criteria. IQ, index and age-scaled subtest scores were compared across three groups: (a) English-speaking background (n = 130), (b) culturally and linguistically <b>diverse</b> <b>background</b> and education completed in English (n = 33), and (c) culturally and linguistically <b>diverse</b> <b>background</b> and non-English education (n = 33). Cultural backgrounds included people of Asian, European, Middle Eastern, African and Oceania origin. Results were that the English-educated culturally and linguistically diverse group performed lower than the English-speaking background group on some verbal WAIS-III measures; effect sizes were small-moderate. The non-English-educated culturally and linguistically diverse group performed lower than both groups on several WAIS-III and one WMS-III measure, with large effect sizes. Clinical implications included the need for caution in interpreting test scores to avoid diagnostic errors {{and the need for}} further development of valid assessment tools. 11 page(s...|$|R
