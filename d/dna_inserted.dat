40|$|With current plant {{transformation}} methods (Agrobacterium, biolistics and protoplast fusion), {{insertion of}} DNA into the genome occurs randomly {{and in many}} instances at multiple sites. Associated position effects, copy number differences and multigene interactions can make gene expression experiments difficult to interpret and plant phenotypes less predictable. An alternative approach to random integration of large DNA fragments into plants is to utilize one of several site-specific recombination (SSR) systems, such as Cre/lox. Cre {{has been shown in}} numerous instances to mediate lox site-specific recombination in animal and plant cells. By incor­porating the Cre/lox SSR system into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector, a more precise evaluation of large <b>DNA</b> <b>inserts</b> for genetic complementation should be possible. Site-specific insertion of DNA into predefined sites in the genome may eliminate unwanted ‘position effects’ caused by the random integration of exogenously introduced DNA. In an effort to make the Cre/lox system an effective tool for site-directed integration of large DNAs, we constructed and tested a new vector potentially capable of integrating large <b>DNA</b> <b>inserts</b> into plant and fungal genomes.

Especially in the USA, protein-based detection is used for the construct-specific approach.|$|E
50|$|Before {{analyzing}} target genome {{structural aberration}} and copy number variation (CNV) with ESP, the target genome is usually amplified and conserved with artificial chromosome construction. The classic strategy {{to construct an}} artificial chromosome is bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Basically, the target chromosome is randomly digested and inserted into plasmids which are transformed and cloned in bacteria. The size of fragments inserted is 150-350 kb. Another commonly used artificial chromosome is fosmid.

A novel plasmid has been engineered to convert virtually any DNA sequence, or combination of sequences, into an artificial transposon; hence, custom transposons containing any desired feature can be easily designed and constructed. Such transposons are then efficiently inserted into plasmid targets, in vitro, using the integrase activity present in yeast Ty 1 virus-like particles. A single in vitro integration reaction, which resembles a simple restriction digestion in the complexity of the reaction, gives rise to thousands of recoverable insertion events within DNA target molecules; this frequency approaches one insertion per phosphodiester bond in typical plasmids. Importantly, transposon insertions are recovered from all regions of <b>DNA</b> <b>inserts</b> carried on plasmid targets, indicating that integration is a random or nearly-random process.
