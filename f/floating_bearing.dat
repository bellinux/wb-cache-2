A significant impact to the audible tonal noise spectrum {{results from the}} vibratory motions of fast-rotating turbocharger rotor systems in multiple hydrodynamic bearings such as <b>floating</b> <b>bearing</b> rings. Particularly, the study of self-excited non-linear vibrations of the rotor-bearing systems is crucial for the understanding, prevention or reduction of the noise and, consequently, for a sustainable engine acoustics development. This work presents an efficient modeling approach for the investigation, optimization, and design improvement of complex turbocharger rotors in hydrodynamic journal bearings, including <b>floating</b> <b>bearing</b> rings with circular and non-circular bearing geometries. The capability of tonal non-synchronous vibration prevention using non-circular bearing shapes is demonstrated with dynamic run-up simulations of the presented model.

40|$|Piezoceramic-metal-compounds use a {{metallic}} load transmitting layer, a cover sheet and an integrated piezoceramic fibre module to extent the functionality of structural parts for adaptronic applications. The piezoceramic module is deformed by the surrounding metallic sheets during the part production. Within the process, a lubricated <b>floating</b> <b>bearing,</b> implemented by usage of a liquid adhesive, reduces the module stresses drastically to a non-critical level {{compared with the}} case of a completely tied module. The adhesive fully cures after the shaping operation is performed and thus secures a stiff joint between the piezoceramic fibre module and the surrounding sheet metals. Despite the lubricated <b>floating</b> <b>bearing,</b> shaping of the sheet metals may cause geometric constraints, which induce significant membrane strains in the fibre module. This possible one-off overload during the production process can cause a reduction of the functionality of piezoceramicmetal- compounds. In this thesis a method is developed {{that can be used to}} determine the functionality reduction of piezoceramic-metal-compounds and utilises the results in numerical simulations to predict the residual performance of such structural parts. The decrease of the piezoceramic module performance dependent on load level and direction is investigated with basic experiments. With the results a performance model is derieved. It is further validated by the comparison of simulations and experimental results of the compound shaping operation. The thesis focuses on the development of a methodology, that allows for a prediction of the adaptronic part functionality after shaping operation.

Three basic groups of rotors are analyzed and some methods of suppressing instability are shown. In the 1 st group are classical elastic rotors sup-ported in hydrodynamic bearings.

The 2 nd group is composed of combus-tion engines turbocharger rotors, which are characteristic by heavy impellers at both overhung ends of elastic shaft.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Turbochargers are commonly used to increase the power output and efficiency of internal combustion automotive engines. Conventional turbocharger rotors are usually supported on floating ring journal bearings (FRBs) running with engine oil as lubricant. FRBs are comprised of an inner and outer thin lubricated films in series, and offer lower power losses and also cooler operation conditions than a single-land hydrodynamic journal bearing (Wilcock, 1983). FRBs are also very attractive for turbomachinery because of the inherent high damping characteristics associated to the presence of two fluid films (Orcutt and Ng, 1968). However FRBs can lead to rotordynamic instability, exhibiting subsynchronous rotor whirl in most of their operating range. Nonetheless, FRBs often reach stable limit cycles, thus becoming cost-effective solutions to the rotor support design. The main objective of the research was to identify the fundamental physical parameters that affect the dynamic performance of a rotor supported on a floating ring bearing from measurements of the rotor response to calibrated imbalance masses. Experiments were performed on a test rig to measure the system threshold of instability, amplitude of limit cycle, and range of whirl frequencies as a function of bearing load, rotor imbalance and the rotor speed. Measurements of the rotor response demonstrate that the rotor-FRB system renders an unstable behavior for almost the entire journal speed range and achieves a limit cycle at the maximum running speed (10, 000 rpm). The system non linearity is evidenced by two self-excited subsynchronous vibration components identified from the experiments. The first subsynchronous component is associated with the instability of the inner film and the second component is associated with the instability of the outer film. Localized absence of subsynchronous vibration components is evident for higher supply pressures at specific operating speeds. Full floating ring and semi floating ring conditions are examined in the study. The semi <b>floating</b> <b>bearing</b> ring is the most unfavorable condition for the rotor bearing system due to the high levels of vibration observed on the test rotor-FRB...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{bearings}} in oil-free micro-turbomachinery for {{process gas}} applications and for power generation (< 400 kW) must offer adequate load capacity and thermal stability, reliable rotordynamic performance {{at high speeds}} and temperatures, low power losses and minimal maintenance costs. The metal mesh foil bearing (MMFB) is a promising foil bearing technology offering inexpensive manufacturing cost, large inherent material energy dissipation mechanism, and custom-tailored stiffness and damping properties. This dissertation presents predictions and measurements of the dynamic forced performance of various high speed and high temperature MMFBs. MMFB forced performance depends mainly on its elastic support structure, consisting of arcuate metal mesh pads and a smooth top foil. The analysis models the top foil as a 2 D finite element (FE) shell supported uniformly by a metal mesh under-layer. The solution of the structural FE model coupled with a gas film model, governed by the Reynolds equation, delivers the pressure distribution over the top foil and thus the load reaction. A perturbation analysis further renders the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for the bearing. The static and dynamic performance predictions are validated against limited published experimental data. A one-to-one comparison of the static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of a MMFB against a Generation I bump foil bearing (BFB) of similar size, with a slenderness ratio L/D= 1. 04, showcases the comparative performance of MMFB against a commercially available gas foil bearing design. The measurements of rotor lift-off speed and drag friction at start-up and airborne conditions are conducted for rotor speeds up to 70 krpm and under identical specific loads (W/LD = 0. 06 to 0. 26 bar). The dynamic force coefficients of the bearings are estimated, in a ?<b>floating</b> <b>bearing?</b> type test rig, while floating atop a journal spinning to speeds as high as 50 krpm and with controlled static loads (22 N) applied in the vertical direction. The parameter identification is conducted in the frequency range of 200 - 400 Hz first, and then up to 600 Hz using higher load capacity shakers. A finite element rotordynamic program (XLTRC 2) models a hollow rotor and two MMFBs supporting it and predict the synchronous rotor response for known imbalances. The predictions agree well with the ambient temperature rotor response measurements. Extensive rotor response measurements and rotor and bearing temperature measurements, with a coil heater warming up to 200 ?C and placed inside the hollow rotor, reveal the importance of adequate thermal management. The database of high speed high temperature performance measurements {{and the development of}} a predictive tool will aid in the design and deployment of MMFBs in commercial high-speed turbomachinery.

The present investigation advances a rotordynamic analysis of an automotive turbocharger with <b>floating</b> ring <b>bearings.</b> Each fluid film of the <b>floating</b> ring <b>bearing</b> is analyzed using a finite element model. The model includes the effects of lubricant heating and bearing clearance changes due to bearing power consumption. The <b>floating</b> ring <b>bearing</b> analysis provides both floating ring speeds and bearing force coefficients for use in a linear rotordynamic model. The linear rotordynamic evaluation yields predictions of system stability as well as response to imbalance. The linear analysis employs a 27 -station finite element model to capture the flexibility of the shaft. The analysis evidences several modes that become unstable at very low speeds, including cylindrical and conical modes for both inner and outer fluid films. Typically, the frequencies of the unstable modes are close to half the ring speed or half the ring plus rotor speeds. These results are supported by a non-linear transient analysis of the rotor-bearing system. The transient predicts the amplitude of the limit cycle motion for the unstable modes. Non-linear transient predictions are generated for a range of lubricant supply conditions with varied supply temperature and pressure. Ring speed and shaft motion predictions are compared to measurements taken on an automotive turbocharger test apparatus. Eddy-current proximity probes measure the shaft motion {{at both ends of the}} shaft, while fiber optic probes measure the ring speeds. The non-linear transient predicts the frequency content of the measured response with fair accuracy, but it usually over-predicts the amplitude of the response. In particular, the analysis fails to predict the effect of increasing lubricant supply pressure. In general, increasing the lubricant supply pressure reduces shaft motion amplitude. This investigation also attempts to identify through shaft motion measurements the effects of aerodynamic loading of the compressor, if any. Shaft motion measurements taken with the compressor housing re-oriented (in order to re-direct the aerodynamic load) showed that the aerodynamic load impacted the static displacement of the rotor, but the dynamic response showed little deviation from the original measurements...|$|R
