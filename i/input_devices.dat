5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality <b>input</b> <b>devices.</b> These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional <b>input</b> <b>devices,</b> such as control pads.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} <b>input</b> <b>devices,</b> rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized <b>input</b> <b>devices</b> such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E

50|$|An absolute-movement <b>input</b> <b>device</b> (e.g., stylus, {{finger on}} touch screen) {{provides}} a consistent mapping between {{a point in}} the input space (location/state of the <b>input</b> <b>device)</b> and {{a point in the}} output space (position of pointer on screen). A relative-movement <b>input</b> <b>device</b> (e.g., mouse, joystick) maps displacement in the input space to displacement in the output state.

25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other <b>input</b> <b>devices.</b> Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or <b>input</b> <b>devices</b> for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.|$|E

25|$|Some systems allow {{two or more}} mice to be used at once as <b>input</b> <b>devices.</b> 16-bit era home {{computers}} such as the Amiga used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer (Lemmings and The Settlers for example).

25|$|SAMPA was devised as a hack to {{work around}} the {{inability}} of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Consequently, as Unicode support for IPA symbols becomes more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA in ASCII decreases. However, text input relies on specific keyboard encodings or <b>input</b> <b>devices.</b> For this reason, SAMPA and X-SAMPA are still widely used in computational phonetics and in speech technology.|$|E
