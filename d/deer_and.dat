5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, red <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E

5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{may have}} visited the Yosemite area {{as long as}} 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.
