40|$|Ecohydrological <b>feedbacks</b> {{are likely}} to be {{critical}} for understanding the mechanisms by which changes in exogenous forces result in ecosystem state change. We propose that in drylands, the dynamics of ecosystem state change are determined by changes in the type (stabilizing vs amplifying) and strength of ecohydrological <b>feedbacks</b> following a change in exogenous forces. Using a selection of five case studies from drylands, we explore the characteristics of ecohydrological <b>feedbacks</b> and resulting dynamics of ecosystem state change. We surmise that stabilizing <b>feedbacks</b> are critical for the provision of plant-essential resources in drylands. Exogenous forces that break these stabilizing <b>feedbacks</b> can alter the state of the system, although such changes are potentially reversible if strong amplifying ecohydrological <b>feedbacks</b> do not develop. The case studies indicate that if amplifying ecohydrological <b>feedbacks</b> do develop, they are typically associated with abiotic processes such as runoff, erosion (by wind and water), and fire.

40|$|Human {{reactions}} to conservation interventions can trigger unintended <b>feedbacks</b> resulting in poor conservation outcomes. Understanding unintended <b>feedbacks</b> {{is a necessary}} first step toward the diagnosis and solution of environmental problems, but existing anecdotal evidence cannot support decision-making. Using conservation examples, we present a conceptual framework and typology of unintended <b>feedbacks</b> based on a social-ecological systems (SES) approach. Three types of causal mechanisms for unintended <b>feedbacks</b> are distinguished: (1) flow unintended <b>feedbacks</b> when pre-existing <b>feedbacks</b> are enhanced or dampened; (2) deletion unintended feedbacks; and (3) addition unintended <b>feedbacks</b> when interventions, respectively, remove or add actors or links to the SES structure. Application of this typology can improve conservation outcomes by enabling the inclusion of complex relationships into planning and evaluation. We show how widely used tools for conservation planning could produce misleading recommendations, and discuss future work {{to mitigate the effect}} of unintended <b>feedbacks</b> in conservation practice. There is an urgent need to collect evidence in a structured way {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms by which human decision-making feeds through to conservation outcomes at different scales, thereby minimizing negative unintended <b>feedbacks.</b> The framework presented in this article can support the development of this evidence-base.

The coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework provides a lens {{with which to}} understand such complex interactions.

40|$|The {{projected}} {{response of}} the atmospheric circulation to the radiative changes induced by CO 2 forcing and climate <b>feedbacks</b> is currently uncertain. In this modelling study, the impact of CO 2 -induced climate <b>feedbacks</b> on changes in jet latitude and speed is assessed by imposing surface albedo, cloud, and water vapor <b>feedbacks</b> {{as if they were}} forcings in two climate models, CAM 4 and ECHAM 6. The jet response to radiative <b>feedbacks</b> can be broadly interpreted through changes in midlatitude baroclinicity. Clouds enhance baroclinicity, favoring a strengthened, poleward shifted jet; this is mitigated by surface albedo changes which have the opposite effect on baroclinicity and the jet, while water vapor has opposing effects on upper- and lower-level baroclinicity with little net impact on the jet. Large differences between the CAM 4 and ECHAM 6 responses illustrate how model uncertainty in radiative <b>feedbacks</b> causes a large spread in the baroclinicity response to CO 2 forcing. Across the CMIP 5 models, differences in shortwave <b>feedbacks</b> by clouds and albedo are a dominant contribution to this spread. Forcing CAM 4 with shortwave cloud and albedo <b>feedbacks</b> from a representative set of CMIP 5 models yields a wide range of jet responses that strongly correlate with the meridional gradient of the anomalous shortwave heating and the associated baroclinicity response. Differences in shortwave <b>feedbacks</b> statistically explain about 50 % of the inter-model spread in CMIP 5 jet shifts for our set of models, demonstrating the importance of constraining radiative <b>feedbacks</b> for accurate projections of circulation changes...|$|R
