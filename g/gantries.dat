The maximum stress and the maximum displacement were obtained. Without changing the geometric size of the <b>gantry,</b> the structure of the <b>gantry</b> internal was adjusted to increase its stiffness and strength. Through the finite analysis comparison of the two different stiffeners, better style and distribution form of the stiffener were obtained; the structure of the <b>gantry</b> was optimized. The result shows that the quality of the <b>gantry</b> was reduced by 57 %, and the stiffness and strength were improved by 20 % and 36 %, this provides theory basis for the design and production of <b>gantry</b> welder...|$|R
40|$|We are {{presenting}} the layout and the optics of a beam line {{to be used}} as a medical <b>gantry</b> in radiation therapy. The optical properties of the <b>gantry's</b> beam line are such as to make the beam line achromatic and uncoupled. These two properties make the beam spot size, which is delivered and focused by the <b>gantry,</b> on the tumor of the patient, independent of the angular orientation of the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we present the layout of the magnetic elements of the <b>gantry,</b> and also present the theoretical basis for the optics design of such a <b>gantry.</b> A medical <b>gantry,</b> as it is used in the radiation treatment of cancer patients, is the last part of the beam optical system, of the accelerator complex, which delivers and focuses the beam on the tumor. The curved line shown in figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a <b>gantry</b> which can rotate about a horizontal axis. The particle beam (green arrow in fig. 1) enters the <b>gantry,</b> and is guided by the <b>gantry</b> on the tumor (red spot in fig. 1). As the <b>gantry</b> rotates about the axis shown in figure 1, the beam exiting the <b>gantry</b> always lies on a plane normal to the rotation axis at the point of the icocenter. Thus the <b>gantry</b> facilitates the ability of the beam delivery system, to deliver the beam at the tumor, which is placed at the icocenter, from any angle on this vertical plane, which is normal to the rotation angle of the <b>gantry</b> as stated earlier. The <b>gantry</b> consists of dipoles and quadrupoles elements whose median symmetry plane lies on a plane which contains the rotation axis of the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we define this plane as the 'plane of the gantry'. As the beam is transported along the axis of rotation of the <b>gantry</b> and before it enters the <b>gantry,</b> it is focused by 'normal' quadrupoles and experiences no linear beam coupling. Subsequently the beam enters the <b>gantry,</b> and is transported by the <b>gantry</b> to the delivery point which is the tumor. The transported beam at the tumor is still linearly uncoupled as long as the plane of the <b>gantry</b> lies either, on the horizontal, or the vertical plane. In these two orientations of the <b>gantry</b> the dipoles and the quadrupoles are 'normal' therefore the linear R-transport-matrix appears linearly uncoupled. As the <b>gantry</b> rotates about this horizontal axis, to irradiate the tumor at a different angle, the linear beam coupling is unavoidable since the coordinate system of the <b>gantry's</b> quadrupoles is rotated with respect to the coordinate system of the quadrupoles at the entrance of the <b>gantry</b> which are located along the axis of rotation. As a result, in this rotated coordinate system, the beam will be linearly coupled as it is transported by the <b>gantry</b> to the tumor and the beam size at the location of the tumor will vary in size depending on the orientation of the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we present a method which makes the beam transport R-matrix linearly uncoupled, achromatic and independent of the orientation angle of the <b>gantry</b> as is proven in the following section...|$|R

The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours.

40|$|In VMAT {{treatment}} delivery {{the ability}} of the linear accelerator (linac) to accurately control dose versus <b>gantry</b> angle is critical to delivering the plan correctly. A new VMAT test delivery was developed to specifically test the dose versus <b>gantry</b> angle with the full range of allowed <b>gantry</b> speeds and dose rates. The gantry-mounted IBA MatriXX with attached inclinometer was used in movie mode to measure the instantaneous relative dose versus <b>gantry</b> angle during the plan every 0. 54 s. The results were compared to the expected relative dose at each <b>gantry</b> angle calculated from the plan. The same dataset was also used to compare the instantaneous <b>gantry</b> speeds throughout the delivery compared to the expected <b>gantry</b> speeds from the plan. Measurements performed across four linacs generally show agreement between measurement and plan to within 1. 5 % in the constant dose rate regions and dose rate modulation within 0. 1 s of the plan. Instantaneous <b>gantry</b> speed was measured to be within 0. 11 Â°/s of the plan (1 SD). An error in one linac was detected in that the nominal <b>gantry</b> speed was incorrectly calibrated. This test provides a practical method to quality-assure critical aspects of VMAT delivery including dose versus <b>gantry</b> angle and <b>gantry</b> speed control.

500|$|In {{response}} to the Hillsborough disaster which resulted in 96 fatalities, the Taylor Report of August 1989 recommended that all major grounds be converted to become all-seater as a safety measure. In mid-1990, the first changes were made {{in line with the}} report. The North Stand saw the addition of 2,900 seats to the lower tier of the stand in place of terracing, the Holte End's roof was extended in preparation for more seats, the Trinity Road Stand had its roof replaced, and the Witton Lane Stand had more corporate boxes added. By that time, all four floodlight pylons had been removed to make way for boxes or in preparation for seating, and new floodlights were installed on new <b>gantries</b> on the Trinity and Witton stands. In February 1992, the club's application to the Council for permission to demolish the Holte Hotel was rejected. After several months of negotiations, Villa gained permission for a new stand to replace the Witton Lane Stand. The new design meant that the club had to realign Witton Lane and, as a condition of the planning permission, pay Â£600,000 to compulsory purchase the houses along Witton Lane and upgrade the road from a B to an A road, as well as moving its utilities. The stand was fully operational by January 1994 at the cost of Â£5million with 4,686 seats, which brought Villa Park up to a capacity of 46,005. It was announced at the 70th birthday gala of chairman Doug Ellis that the stand was to be renamed the [...] "Doug Ellis Stand", a move that caused some controversy among Villa fans with some still referring to it as the Witton Lane Stand. Nevertheless, during the 1993â€“1994 season, the newly rebuilt Witton Lane Stand became the Doug Ellis Stand. The Holte End was the only remaining stand that did not meet the Taylor Report requirements, and a structural survey revealed that putting seats onto the existing terracing would be uneconomical. Instead, the decision was taken to build a new stand consisting of two tiers, just four years after construction of the new roof. The demolition of the stand began {{on the last day of}} the 1993â€“94 season. Its replacement began to open in August 1994 with 3,000 seats in the lower tier occupied for the first seating-only game at Villa Park. By December it was fully operational and had a capacity of 13,501 seats, bringing the Villa Park capacity to 40,310. Upon completion, the Holte was the largest single end stand in Britain.|$|E

As well, assessments of the accuracy of other, more accessible, sources of <b>gantry</b> angle information (i. e., treatment log files, analysis of EPID image headers) were investigated. The methods used in this study are generally applicable to any linear accelerator unit, and have been demonstrated here with Clinac/Trilogy systems. <b>Gantry</b> angle data were simultaneously acquired using three methods: i) a direct <b>gantry</b> potentiometer measurement, ii) an incremental rotary encoder, and iii) a custom-made radiographic gantry-angle phantom which produced unique wire intersections as a function of <b>gantry</b> angle. All methods were compared to <b>gantry</b> angle data from the EPID image header and the linac MLC DynaLog file. The encoder and gantry-angle phantom were used to validate the accuracy of the linacâ€™s potentiometer. The EPID image header <b>gantry</b> angles and the DynaLog file <b>gantry</b> angles were compared to the potentiometer. The encoder and gantry-angle phantom mean angle differences with the potentiometer were 0. 13 Â° Â± 0. 14 Â° and 0. 10 Â°Â± 0. 30 Â°, respectively. The EPID image header angles analyzed in this study were within Â± 1 Â° of the potentiometer angles only 35 % of the time. In some cases, EPID image header <b>gantry</b> angles disagreed by as much as 3 Â° with the potentiometer. A time delay in frame acquisition was determined using the continuous acquisition mode of the EPID. After correcting for this time delay, 75 % of the header angles, on average, were within Â± 1 Â° of the true <b>gantry</b> angle, compared to an average of only 35 % without the correction. Applying a boxcar smoothing filter to the corrected <b>gantry</b> angles further improved the accuracy of the header-derived <b>gantry</b> angles to within Â± 1 Â° for almost all images (99. 4 %). An angle accuracy of 0. 11 Â° Â± 0. 04 Â° was determined using a point-by-point comparison of the <b>gantry</b> angle data in the MLC DynaLog file and the potentiometer data. These simple correction methods can be easily applied to individual treatment EPID images in order to more accurately define the <b>gantry</b> angle...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{clinically}} {{evaluate the}} directional dependence of a 2 D seven 29 ion-chamber array with different intensity-modulated radiotherapyÂ (IMRT) plans. Methods: Twenty-five {{patients who had}} already been treated with IMRT plans were selected for the study. Verification plans were created in an Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) for each treatment plan. The verification plans were executed twice for each patient. The first IMRT plan used a true <b>gantry</b> angle (plan-related approach), and the second plan used a 0 Â° <b>gantry</b> angle (field-related approach). Measurements were performed using a Varian Clinac 2100 iX linear accelerator. The fluence was measured for all the delivered plans and analyzed using Verisoft software. A comparison of the fluence was performed between IMRT with a static <b>gantry</b> (0 Â° <b>gantry</b> angle) and real <b>gantry</b> angles. Results: The {{results indicate that the}} Gamma average was 98. 8 % for IMRT with a 0 Â° <b>gantry</b> angle and 96. 616 % for IMRT with a true <b>gantry</b> angle. Average percent difference of normalized doses for IMRT delivered with zero degree <b>gantry</b> angle and IMRT with actual <b>gantry</b> angles is 0. 15 and 0. 88 respectively.
