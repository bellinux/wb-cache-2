5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly {{attributed to the}} wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E
5|$|Middle Ages saw the {{development}} of many satellite traditions of yoga. Hatha yoga <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> this period.|$|E

5|$|The {{mythology of}} Ardhanarishvara – which mainly {{originates}} in the Puranic canons – was developed later to explain existent {{images of the}} deity that had <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the Kushan era.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, a {{financial}} crisis <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> AD 39. Suetonius places {{the beginning of this}} crisis in 38. Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.|$|E
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what remained of the Empire.|$|E
50|$|Winter {{is spent}} in the {{chrysalis}} stage, and adults will <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the spring to seek out host plants. Adults will <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the mornings on a daily basis.

5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1957, the Galveston Historical Foundation {{began its}} efforts to {{preserve}} historic buildings. The 1966 book The Galveston That Was helped encourage the preservation movement.

A new, family-oriented tourism <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the city over many years.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period has been seen one in which a clear national identity <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as cholera which <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1992 in India. The frequency of AIDS/HIV is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8million (1.6% of the population) tested {{were found to}} be infected with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Christianity <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Roman Judea as a Jewish {{religious}} sect in the 1st century AD. The religion gradually {{spread out}} of Jerusalem, initially establishing major bases in first Antioch, then Alexandria, {{and over time}} throughout the Empire as well as beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often {{under the authority of}} local officials.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the United States {{in the early}} and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|Competition <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the New Zealand wrestling {{industry}} during May 2006 in Wellington, when Rip Morgan {{split from}} Stirling's company and Kiwi Pro Wrestling was established, {{made up of}} a number of Stirling's former stars. These new promotions also brought back televised wrestling, which had been absent since the days of Rickard's On the Mat, with the debut of IPW Ignition and KPW's Off the Ropes.|$|E
50|$|Following the Nineteenth Amendment's adoption, many legislators {{feared that}} a {{powerful}} women's bloc would <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> American politics. This {{led to the}} passage of such laws as the Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921, which expanded maternity care during the 1920s. However, a women's bloc did not <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> American politics until the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Adult caddisflies {{are small}} moth-like insects; the adult Dolophilodes distinctus has brown wings with darker brown markings. Adult females <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> summer are winged while those <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> March are often {{brachypterous}} (have vestigial wings). These sometimes breed {{on the snow}} that is {{lying on the ground}} at this time of year.|$|R
50|$|Periodical cicadas are {{assigned}} to broods based on their year of emergence and life-cycle length. The other three 13-year species (M. tredecim, M. tredecassini, and M. tredecula) are represented in {{all three of the}} extant 13-year broods: Brood XIX (<b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> 2011), Brood XXII (<b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> 2014), and Brood XXIII (<b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> 2015). M. neotredecim was first discovered in 1998 in Brood XIX, where it occurs toward {{the northern part of the}} range, showing a narrow range of overlap with the more southern species M. tredecim. It has also been observed in Brood XXIII but not in Brood XXII.|$|R
