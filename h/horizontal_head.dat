50|$|Early {{modification}} Fig. 1. {{reduced the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> length to approximate 115 mm and the 'toe height' to approximately 75 mm.

50|$|The Kentish plover {{is a small}} shorebird {{weighing}} around 40g as an adult. Both {{male and}} female birds have black bills and dark legs, however adults have dimorphic plumage. During the breeding season, males have a black <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> bar, two incomplete dark breast-bands {{on each side of}} their breast, black ear coverts and a rufous nape and crown (although there is some variation between breeding populations), whereas the females are paler in these areas, without the dark markings. In the early breeding season, it is easy to distinguish between males and females since the ornaments are very pronounced, but as the breeding season progresses, {{the differences between the two}} sexes decrease. Moreover, males have longer tarsi and longer flank feathers than females. Longer flank feathers are thought to be an advantage for incubation and brood care, as the quality of feathers is associated with heat insulation.There are multiple significant predictors of plumage ornamentation in Kentish plovers. Firstly, the interaction between the advancement of the breeding season and rainfall seem to affect ornamentation. Male ornaments become more elaborated over the course of a breeding season in regions with high rainfall, whereas in regions with low rainfall, male ornaments become lighter. Secondly, the interaction between the breeding system and the sex can predict the degree of plumage ornamentation. In polygamous populations, the sexual ornaments are more pronounced, generating a stronger sexual dimorphism than in monogamous populations. The difference is especially witnessed in males, whereby the ornaments are darker and smaller in polygamous populations compared to monogamous populations, where males have lighter and larger ornaments. This is thought to be the result of a trade-off between the size and intensity of the ornaments.|$|E

5000|$|English Heritage {{describes}} the building's design as [...] "unusual". The stylistic {{details derive from}} the French Baroque style of the late 17th century. The building is V-shaped, of two main storeys with double attics in red brick under a slate roof. The Pillory Street façade, of eight bays, is approximately double {{the length of the}} Hospital Street façade, which has four bays. The curved corner, of a further three bays, forms the junction of the two streets with High Street, and is finished with a concave spirelet, giving a dome-like appearance. The spirelet bears a flag pole. The ground floor has cream-coloured rendering with a string course above, and part of the first floor and lower attic level is also rendered.The main entrance is at the curved corner; the doorcase has flanking pilasters with a pediment above. A second entrance takes the place of one of the original windows on the Pillory Street face, while the original second doorway {{at the end of this}} face is now blind. The windows flanking the main doorway and two others on the Pillory Street face have rectangular heads; the other ground-floor windows have semicircular heads. In both cases, the top part is divided into small panes (now obscured by modern shop-window hoods). The ground-floor shop windows are all flanked by pilasters and topped with moulding detail including a keystone-like feature that reaches the string course. The mullioned and transomed first-floor windows have <b>horizontal</b> <b>heads</b> with brick keystone detailing. The two attic storeys each have a row of circular dormer windows in the steep roof, the lower set being decorated below with festoons of fruit and flowers, which differ in detail from window to window. The drainpipe heads are all inscribed with 1911 in a lozenge pattern.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} two systems {{that were used}} for head pose {{estimation}} during the CLEAR 06 Evaluation. We participated in two tasks: (1) estimating both pan and tilt orientation on synthetic, high resolution head captures, (2) estimating <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> orientation only on real seminar recordings that were captured with multiple cameras from different viewing angles. In both systems, we used a neural network to estimate the persons ’ head orientation. In case of seminar recordings, a Bayes filter framework is further used to provide a statistical fusion scheme, integrating every camera view into one joint hypothesis. We achieved a mean error of 12. 3 ◦ on <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> orientation estimation, in the monocular, high resolution task. Vertical orientation performed with 12. 77 ◦ mean error. In case of the multi-view seminar recordings, our system could correctly identify head orientation in 34. 9 % (one of eight classes). If neighbouring classes were allowed, even 72. 9 % of the frames were correctly classified. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose. Whether {{turning their}} {{head to look}} down a grocery store aisle or having a {{conversation}} on an evening stroll, people perform additional tasks while they walk. There is evidence that as walking becomes more difficult, either due to aging or illness, simultaneously performing other tasks can affect gait. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show that gait performance declines more in the older group than in younger adults in the presence of the secondary tasks of <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> rotations and cognition. Methods. Seventy-six subjects were divided into two groups according to age. There were 40 subjects in the 18 - 27 year old group and 36 subjects in the 52 - 92 year old group. Each subject walked on a GAITRite™ gait mat five times at their normal pace; three trials with the single task of ambulation, one trial with the additional task of <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> rotations, and one trial with the additional task of cognition. For each condition, five gait parameters were collected using the gait mat and changes in these parameters were calculated with the addition of the secondary tasks. These changes between single and dual task conditions were compared between the young and old populations. Results. Statistically significant differences were found between the young and old populations for the head turning task and the parameters of velocity (p= 0. 0006), stride length (p= 0. 0009), base of support (p= 0. 0035), and angle range (p= 0. 0209) and for the cognitive task and the parameters of velocity (p= 0. 0002), stride length (p= 0. 0067), and angle range (p=O. 0105). No statistically significant changes were found between the young and old populations for the cognitive task and base of support and with either dual task condition and double limb support single limb support ratio. Conclusion and Discussion. The results of this study suggest that a greater change in the gait parameters of velocity, stride length, and angle range occurs with age when the secondary tasks of <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> rotations and cognition are added to the primary tasks of ambulation. Changes in base of support are greater in older people when the secondary task of <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> rotations is added to ambulation...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. There {{is little}} {{information}} regarding the characteristics of head movements during reading. This study was undertaken to investigate horizontal and vertical head movements during two different reading tasks. METHODS. Head and eye movements were monitored with an infrared pupil and head tracker in 15 subjects during repeated reading of text from an A 4 -sized card and a card 90 ° wide. In addition, head and eye movements were recorded in 45 subjects to compare head movement propensity during an A 4 text-reading task and a saccadic task of an equivalent gaze shift. RESULTS. During the A 4 standard reading task, horizontal and vertical head movements accounted for 4. 7 % and 28. 7 % of the gaze shift, respectively. During the 90 ° text reading, <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> movements accounted for 40. 3 % of the gaze amplitude, and vertical head movements accounted for 28. 4 %. Horizontal gaze velocities increased significantly on repeated A 4 and 90 ° text readings, as did <b>horizontal</b> <b>head</b> velocities and amplitudes. Reading head movement propensities were significantly smaller than saccadic head movement propensities (P � 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS. Head movement strategies are rapidly switched between the A 4 and 90 ° text-reading paradigms. They are minimized during A 4 text reading but actively assist the gaze strategy during 90 ° text reading. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>head</b> movement is reduced during A 4 reading compared to the equivalent saccadic task and may be suppressed to improve fixation stability. The results {{support the view that}} the head and eye movement system is a highly coupled but extremely flexible system. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2003; 44 : 2991 – 2998) DOI...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that self-motion has an {{inhibiting}} effect on concurrent 3 D motion perception. To investigate whether self-motion similarly impairs concurrent image motion perception, we examined human perception of head-referenced horizontal image motion during head movement. The displayed stimulus was composed of a checkerboard image in a head mounted display oscillating from side to side at four frequencies (0. 25, 0. 5, 1 and 2 Hz) with half peak-to-peak amplitudes ranging from 0 ° to 5. 64. Eight observers rated the magnitude of the checkerboard motion while either rotating their head about a vertical axis (yaw), about a horizontal axis (pitch), or holding it still. For all image oscillation frequencies, perceptual sensitivity to image motion amplitude was reduced during both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>head</b> movements (mean reduction: 0. 44 and 0. 17, respectively). In contrast, perceptual bias was affected only at 2 Hz (mean shift: – 9. 9 % and – 12. 2 % of the full image motion amplitude for <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>head</b> movements, respectively). The results indicate that head movement causes gain reductions in motion magnitude estimation at image oscillation frequencies ≤ 1 Hz. At an oscillation frequency of 2 Hz, head movement produces both a gain reduction and a bias shift. Virtual environment developers could take advantage of such effects by relaxing requirements for image stability as well as motion fidelity during head movement...|$|R
