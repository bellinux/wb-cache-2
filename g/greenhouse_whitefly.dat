Whiteflies resistant to Knack, detected {{for the first time in}} Arizona in 1999, were again detected in 2000 but at lower frequencies than in 1999. Though whiteflies resistant to Admire/Provado ® continued to be found at specific locations, overall susceptibility to Admire/Provado in 2000 remained high in whitefly collections from cotton. The new neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and acetamiprid, were similar in toxicity to Arizona whiteflies in laboratory bioassays and we confirmed the significant but relatively low-order cross-resistance we previously reported between these neonicotinoids and Admire/Provado. Arizona whiteflies continued to be relatively susceptible to mixtures of Danitol ® (fenpropathrin) and Orthene ® (acephate). Factors that could undermine the current success of whitefly resistance management in Arizona are discussed.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{new possibilities}} to control <b>whiteflies</b> in <b>greenhouse</b> ornamental crops with omnivorous predatory bugs and volatiles. Besides the well-known Macrolophus pygmaeus, we tested 4 {{new species of}} predatory bugs: Dicyphus errans, Dicyphus eckerleini, Dicyphus maroccanus and Dicyphus tamaninii. We assessed both their potential to control whiteflies and their possible plant damaging effects through plant feeding. The best control of whiteflies was achieved by the species M. pygmaeus, D. tamaninii and D. maroccanus. Significant flower damage was only observed for the predator M. pygmaeus. The degree of flower damage depended strongly on the gerbera cultivar, but damage was observed for both large-flowered and small-flowered types. All 5 species of predatory bugs were able to establish in a winter crop of 2 gerbera cultivars and the exotic plant Lantana camara. The most promising candidate predatory bug for biological control in gerbera is D. maroccanus. This species established well on the 2 tested gerbera cultivars, gave in all cases an excellent control of pests and no significant plant damage was observed. The predatory bugs gave, besides whiteflies, a good control of Echinothrips {{and in some cases}} a suppression of aphids and western flower thrips.

40|$|International audienceAmblydromalus limonicus (Acari: Phytoseiidae) was {{described}} in 1956 from citrus in California; its distribution range covers North and South America, Australia and New Zealand. It first {{caught the attention of}} biocontrol workers in the 1960 s as natural enemy of the spider mites Oligonychus punicae and Tetranychus cinnabarinus in avocados and other fruit trees. In laboratory studies, A. limonicus developed into adults and laid eggs on several species of mites, thrips, whiteflies and scale insects, as well as on pollen. Interest into A. limonicus re-emerged in the early 1990 s after the western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis) had spread nearly all over the world. It was collected during surveys for WFT biocontrol agents in New Zealand and Australia. Laboratory and semi-field experiments in the Netherlands and Australia showed that A. limonicus was a very promising candidate for biological control of WFT in several greenhouse crops. However, {{it was not possible to}} establish a commercially viable mass rearing system. At around the same time A. limonicus was also identified in surveys in South America for classical biocontrol agents for the cassava green mite (Mononychellus tanajoa) in Africa. Detailed taxonomic research showed, however, that the mites collected in these surveys were a closely related, undescribed species that was given the name Amblydromalus manihoti in 1994. Recently, a mass production system for A. limonicus was developed and the mite became commercially available in January 2012. With the material from this mass production system, more semi-field and field trials could be conducted. Results showed that A. limonicus is also an excellent biocontrol agent for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>whiteflies</b> (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) in various greenhouse crops including roses, cucumbers and strawberries. As this predatory mite originates from more temperate areas, it is a good complement to Amblyseius swirskii, which is currently the most frequently used phytoseiid in thrips and whitefly control, and Transeius montdorensis, which also recently came on the market. Both species originate from sub-tropical regions and have a higher optimum temperature than A. limonicus...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} pest identification method suitable for large scale, long term monitoring for mobile or embedded devices in situ with less computational cost. A procedure of segmentation and image separation was devised to identify common <b>greenhouse</b> pests, <b>whiteflies,</b> aphid and thrips. Initially, the watershed algorithm {{was used to}} segment insects from the background (i. e., sticky trap) images. Color feature of the insects were subsequently extracted by Mahalanobis distance for identification of pest species. Accuracy and computational costs were evaluated across different image resolutions. The correlation of determination (R- 2) between the proposed identification scheme and manual identification were high, showing 0. 934 for whitefly, 0. 925 for thrips, and 0. 945 for aphids even with low resolution images. Comparing with the conventional methods, pests were efficiently identified with low computational cost. Optimal image resolution for species identification regarding long-term survey was discussed in practical aspect with less computational complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|Both larvae {{and adults}} are active predators that can consume {{numerous}} eggs or nymphs each day. An adult Delphastus takes {{no longer than}} half a minute to handle a whitefly egg, and devours up to 160 eggs or 12 large nymphs daily. A larva consumes 1000 whitefly eggs (less if it also eats whitefly nymphs) during its entire development. Adults and larvae feed by piercing the insect with their mouthparts and alternately sucking and regurgitating the internal contents to digest and consume it. Adult females feed more on eggs and first instars than on later stages. They are strong fliers that will migrate to areas that contain high densities of whiteflies. D. pusillus is most effective at high whitefly densities. Since adult female beetles must feed on over 200 eggs per day in order to reproduce, it may be of limited benefit in <b>greenhouses</b> where <b>whitefly</b> populations are low.

Two factitious foods (Ephestia kuehniella eggs and decapsulated cysts of Artemia franciscana) and meridic artificial diets (composed of honey, sucrose, tryptone, yeast extract, and egg yolk) supplemented with pupal hemolymph of Antheraea pernyi, with E. kuehniella eggs, with A. franciscana cysts or prepupal hemolymph of Hermetia illucens were investigated.
