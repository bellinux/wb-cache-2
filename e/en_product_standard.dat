40|$|Background & aims: Non-coagulation {{of protein}} from enteral {{nutrition}} (EN) {{in the stomach}} is considered to improve gastric emptying and may result in reduced upper gastrointestinal complications such as reflux and aspiration pneumonia. For {{the development of a}} new EN protein mixture with reduced gastric coagulation, the coagulating properties of individual proteins, a novel blend of four proteins (P 4 protein blend) and commercial <b>EN</b> <b>products</b> were investigated. Methods: A semi-dynamic, computer controlled setup was developed to mimic gastric digestion. The coagulation behaviour of 150 ml protein solutions and <b>EN</b> <b>products</b> was investigated. These were heattreated calcium caseinate, sodium caseinate, whey, soy and pea protein, and the P 4 protein blend comprising of the latter four (all solutions 6 % w/v protein), four new enteral nutrition product varieties (New Nutrison 1. 0 or 1. 5 kcal/ml, with and without MultiFibre MF 6) based on the P 4 protein blend and two other commercially available casein dominant <b>EN</b> <b>products</b> (T 1 and T 2). Results: Calcium caseinate and sodium caseinate yielded a total wet coagulate of 43. 5 0. 7 g and 52. 7 6. 2 g, respectively. Whey, soy, pea and the P 4 protein blend did not produce any measurable coagulate. T 1 and T 2 resulted in a total wet coagulate of 37. 5 0. 8 g and 57. 3 0. 8 g, respectively, while all new <b>EN</b> <b>product</b> varieties based on the P 4 protein blend did not produce any measurable coagulate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} involves two set of papers. The {{first chapter}} contains a brief {{introduction of the}} issues covered in this thesis. In {{the first set of}} papers (chapters 2 and 3) I investigate the use of <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> in international trade. <b>Product</b> <b>standards</b> relate to restrictions on the attributes of a product that must be satisfied before the product becomes eligible to be sold in a particular market. The World Trade Organization ruling on <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> requires member countries to apply equal standards on the home produced good and the imported good. This is called the national treatment rule. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation (Chapters 2 and 3) I analyze the role of national treatment rule in the case of <b>product</b> <b>standards.</b> Chapter 4 evaluates the growth experience of Mauritius in the light of the explanations put forward in the empirical growth literature. As an African country Mauritius stands out as an exception, not only having a much higher growth rate than an average African country but also maintaining growth as a sustained phenomenon. I demonstrate that this exceptional growth performance of Mauritius has occurred because of some unique institutional features of Mauritius, making it different from the rest of Africa...|$|R
40|$|Trade {{disputes}} over national <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> are a growing source of {{tension in the}} international trading system. The usual pattern is that a country introduces a new <b>product</b> <b>standard</b> for all sales of a good in its local market, which is justified as necessary for consumer or environmental protection. Importers into the local market, however, challenge the standard as a ''disguised barrier to trade'' or ''green protectionism''. The paper develops a two country political economy model to explain such disputes. It is shown how the political process {{can lead to a}} ''political failure'' which takes the form of either too many or too few <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> and disagreement between politicians in different countries over the optimal policy. In a second step the model is used to evaluate whether two common proposals to settle or avoid such disputes, mutual recognition of standards and harmonization, can improve the political process. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{investigate}} the impact of the introduction of an environmental <b>product</b> <b>standard</b> on trade flows and social welfare. Since <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> may affect the environmental friendliness of a product, we build a theoretical framework that allows us to: (1) theoretically investigate, the role of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s concern for the environmental friendliness of a product in shaping the impact of environmental <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> on trade flows and social welfare; (2) empirically estimate the effect of the introduction of the 1991 German Packaging Ordinance on the German imports of beverage products and social welfare. ^ Our theoretical analysis suggests that environmental <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> adopted in a country where the consumer cares about the environmental friendliness of a product are less likely to act as a barrier to trade and have a negative effect on social welfare. This policy would therefore be easier to implement in such a country. ^ Furthermore, if the introduction of an environmental <b>product</b> <b>standard</b> worsens the competitive position of foreign products, the impact on trade flows will be negative, but the impact on social welfare can still be positive if the sum of the changes in the quality-price relationship of home and foreign products is positive. ^ Our empirical analysis finds evidence that the 1991 German packaging ordinance had a negative impact on the quality of foreign products relative to that of home products as perceived by the consumer. The ordinance ultimately caused an overall loss in potential sales for foreign producers equal to 544, 165, 000 U. S. Dollars (1996 value) between 1993 and 1996, which represents the. 0. 3...|$|R

To focus on restrictive <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> only, we use a new database compiling the list of measures that have been raised as concerns in dedicated committees of the WTO. We restrict our analysis to the subset of Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) regulatory measures and analyse the effects of <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> on three variables: (i) probability to export and to exit the export market (firm-product extensive margins), (ii) value exported (firm-product intensive margin) and (iii) export prices. In particular we study whether firms size, market shares and export orientation modify the effect of SPS measures. We find that SPS measures discourage exports. We also find a negative effect of SPS imposition on the intensive margins of trade. Finally, the negative effects of SPS measures on the extensive and intensive margins of trade are attenuated for big firms...|$|R

Measurements carried out since then showed that the noise caused by ignition systems reduced, but man-made noise in business areas and city centers increased. But the interference scenario changed: from analog communication systems in relatively free space to digital systems in living areas, often semi-enclosed such as offices, industrial production areas, and even cars and trains. Measurements in these semi-enclosed environments show a much higher, up to 60 dB, manmade noise level. The higher noise level is not only due to a shorter distance {{to the source of}} emission, but mainly due to mistakenly assumption that compliance with a harmonized <b>product</b> <b>standard</b> is sufficient evidence of compliance with the European EMC directive.
