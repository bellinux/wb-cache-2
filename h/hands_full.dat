It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, <b>hands,</b> <b>full</b> legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their <b>hands</b> <b>full</b> {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his <b>hands</b> <b>full</b> trying to calm unpaid soldiers {{who were on the}} verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria because he was too old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E

25|$|Around {{this time}} {{someone close to}} Sverre wrote a speech against the bishops, En tale mot biskopene. In this work, the unknown author {{discussed}} the relationship between King and Church. By referring to well known theological works such as the Decretum Gratiani and the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the author attempted {{to prove that the}} excommunication of Sverre was unjust and thus not binding. The author also tried to defend the right of Sverre to appoint bishops. To support this view he had to interpret Norwegian law, since the Church had long considered this to be simony. By now Sverre had his <b>hands</b> <b>full</b> with the church-supported Bagler rising, and the direct struggle with the church became a sideshow, at least for him personally.|$|E
25|$|For all the {{fighting}} and destruction, the Burmese gained only the lower Tenasserim coast. It is likely that even the retention of Tenasserim was possible only because the Siamese were immersed in their civil war. A more united Siam would have likely retaken at least the lower Tenasserim coast, if not the upper coast since almost all Burmese troops were deployed on the Chinese front throughout 1768 and 1769. (Recall that Ekkathat, widely {{considered to be an}} ineffective ruler, was able to retake the lower coast in 1761 while Naungdawgyi had his <b>hands</b> <b>full</b> with multiple rebellions. A much more able leader like Taksin would certainly have retaken Tenasserim {{if it were not for}} the civil war.) But the Sino-Burmese war ended in December 1769 about six months before Taksin finished reunifying mainland Siam. Taksin chose not yet to renew the war with the Burmese, instead chose to focus on consolidating his gains in mainland Siam. (The Siamese would not launch an offensive war against the Burmese until 1787.) The territory of Tenasserim, with over 800 islands, which had been under Siamese rule for nearly five centuries, passed to the Burmese.|$|E

25|$|Abkhazia, as a duchy (saeristavo) within Georgia, {{was ruled}} by the clan of Shervashidze (aka Sharvashidze, Chachba, or Sharashia) since the 12th century. The sources are very scarce about the Abkhazian history of that time. The Genoese {{established}} their trading factories along the Abkhazian coastline in the 14th century, but they functioned for a short time. When the Georgian kingdom was embroiled in a bitter {{civil war in the}} 1450s, the Shervashidzes joined a major rebellion against King George VIII of Georgia, which saw him defeated {{at the hands of the}} rebels at Chikhori in 1463. As a result, Georgia split into three rival kingdoms and five principalities. The Abkhazian princes were the vassals of the Principality of Mingrelia under the dynasty of Dadiani(-Bediani), which, in turn, was subordinated to the Kingdom of Imereti. The vassalage was, however, largely nominal, and both Mingrelian and Abkhazian rulers not only successfully fought for their independence, but contested borders with each other and with Imereti. The independence of Abkhazia was largely symbolic as the region was generally left alone as the kings of Imereti had their <b>hands</b> <b>full</b> governing their designated area. In 1490, the split became official as Georgia was split by treaty into the three entities: the Kingdom of Kartli, Imereti, which Abkhazia was theoretically part of, and Kakheti.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{introduced}} a new automated voice control system called Siri, that allows the user to give the iPhone commands, which it can execute and respond to.

[...] These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given {{do not have to}} be specific and can be used with natural language. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their <b>hands</b> <b>full.</b> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.|$|E
