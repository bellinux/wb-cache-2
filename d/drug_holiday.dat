Setting: Eight primary care clinics within a university-based health care system. Patients: A total of 201 postmenopausal women of ages 55 – 89 years, with osteopenia or osteoporosis, prescribed bisphosphonate therapy for > 4 years, between October 10, 2002 and September 9, 2012. Main results: The patients&# 39; mean age was 71. 4 (± 8. 2) years; their mean body mass index was 25. 3 (± 5. 6) kg/m 2; and 73. 1 % were white. Seventy-four out of 201 patients (36. 8 %) were low-risk; 10 / 201 (5. 0 %) were mild-risk; 72 / 201 (35. 8 %) were moderate-risk; and 45 / 201 (22. 4 %) were high-risk. Eighty-one women (40. 3 %) were eligible for a <b>drug</b> <b>holiday</b> or discontinuation. The estimated drug cost avoided per eligible patient was $ 574. 80.

40|$|The amino-bisphosphonates are {{first-line}} {{therapy for}} the treatment of most patients with osteoporosis, with proven efficacy to reduce fracture risk at the spine, hip, and other nonvertebral skeletal sites. Further, bisphosphonates have been associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and increase in survival. Following the use of bisphosphonates in millions of patients in clinical practice, some unexpected possible adverse effects have been reported, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures, atrial fibrillation, and esophageal cancer. Because bisphosphonates are incorporated into the skeleton and continue to exert an antiresorptive effect {{for a period of time}} after dosing is discontinued, the concept of a <b>drug</b> <b>holiday</b> has emerged, whereby the risk of adverse effects might be decreased while the patient still benefits from antifracture efficacy.

40|$|Nonadherence to {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy is}} a substantial problem in HIV and jeopardizes the success of treatment. Accurate measurement of nonadherence is therefore imperative for good clinical management but no gold standard has been agreed on yet. In a single-center prospective study nonadherence was assessed by electronic monitoring: percentage of doses missed and <b>drug</b> <b>holidays</b> and by three self reports: (1) a visual analogue scale (VAS) : percentage of overall doses taken; (2) the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Adherence Questionnaire (SHCS-AQ) : percentage of overall doses missed and <b>drug</b> <b>holidays</b> and (3) the European HIV Treatment Questionnaire (EHTQ) : percentage of doses missed and <b>drug</b> <b>holidays</b> for each antiretroviral drug separately. Virologic failure prospectively assessed during 1 year, and electronic monitoring were used as reference standards. Using virologic failure as reference standard, the best results were for (1) the SHCS-AQ after electronic monitoring (sensitivity, 87. 5 %; specificity, 78. 6 %); (2) electronic monitoring (sensitivity, 75 %; specificity, 85. 6 %), and (3) the VAS combined with the SHCS-AQ before electronic monitoring (sensitivity, 87. 5 %; specificity, 58. 6 %). The sensitivity of the complex EHTQ was less than 50 %. Asking simple questions about doses taken or missed is more sensitive than complex questioning about each drug separately.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether weekend <b>drug</b> <b>holidays</b> would improve sexual functioning in recovered depressed patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) -induced sexual dysfunction. METHOD: Thirty outpatients who reported worsening of sexual functioning during SSRI treatment were instructed to discontinue their SSRIs after the Thursday morning dose and to restart the SSRIs (at their previous dosage) on Sunday at 12 : 00 noon for four weekends. RESULTS: Significant improvement in sexual functioning was reported by the patients taking sertraline and paroxetine but not by those taking fluoxetine. There were no statistically significant increases in mean Hamilton depression scores after discontinuation of the SSRIs; two patients had increases in scores from the 4 - 8 range to the 10 - 14 range.

However, the consequences on short term disease activity have been poorly assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess clinical and radiological disease activity within 6 months after stopping natalizumab in very active relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients. METHODS: In 8 hospitals from Western France, we retrospectively collected clinical and MRI data from consecutive RRMS patients treated with natalizumab for at least 6 months, and who stopped the drug for various reasons except therapeutic failure. Patients didn't receive any other disease modifying treatment after discontinuing natalizumab. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with very active RRMS before natalizumab start (mean annualized relapse rate of 2. 3, MRI activity in 21 of 27 patients) were studied. Within 6 months after discontinuing natalizumab, 18 patients (67 %) experienced clinical relapse and 3 additional patients had radiological activity, without clinical relapse. Four patients (15 %) experienced a rebound activity, with severe relapse and 20 or more gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI.

30|$|The {{relatively}} {{large number of}} drug holidays reported in this study, with a dosing interruption of 3 or more days, are of considerable concern. The rapid discontinuation of a psychotropic drug may trigger immediate withdrawal symptoms or delayed rebound phenomena, related to complex factors including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug formulation, and individual metabolism (Baldessarini et al. 1999; Cerovecki et al. 2013; Franks et al. 2008; Fava et al. 2015; Correll 2010; Osterberg et al. 2010). After a <b>drug</b> <b>holiday,</b> patients often resume taking the full-strength dosage, including of drugs that are slowly titrated upward. Re-starting a drug after a long lapse may trigger first-dose effects (Urquhart 1998). Given the frequent use of polypharmacy, drug holidays may impact the potential for drug interactions (Spina et al. 2016). There {{is a need for}} increased understanding of the clinical impacts of repeated starting and stopping of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs, in various product formulations (Osterberg et al. 2010; Hughes 2008; Samtani et al. 2012). In this study, taking a <b>drug</b> <b>holiday</b> was associated with working full time, suggesting that some patients may doubt they need ongoing treatment (Clatworthy et al. 2009), or lack insight into the value of medications (Copeland et al. 2008).

Methods Daily self-reported medication dosage taken and mood ratings were available from 144 patients who received treatment as usual. All 144 patients took the same antidepressant for at least 100 days. One hundred eleven of these patients were also taking a mood stabilizer. Approximate entropy (ApEn) {{was used to measure}} serial regularity in daily dosage. Regularity is the tendency that values within a time series remain the same on incremental comparisons. <b>Drug</b> <b>holidays</b> (missing three or more consecutive days) were also determined. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to estimate if any demographic or clinical variables were associated with regularity. Results Although the mean percent of days missing doses was only 18. 6 %, there was a wide range of regularity {{in the daily}} antidepressant dosage. <b>Drug</b> <b>holidays</b> were common, occurring in 41 % of the analyses. Factors significantly associated with irregularity were as follows: total number of psychotropic medications (p= 0. 005), pill burden (p= 0. 005), and depression (p= 0. 015). Neither the percent of days missing doses nor the <b>drug</b> <b>holidays</b> were associated with any demographic or clinical factors. For patients taking both antidepressants and mood stabilizers, {{there was no significant difference}} in regularity in daily dosage between these drugs. Discussion There can be considerable irregularity in daily dosage despite a low percent of days missing doses.

40|$|Abstract Background Induction-maintenance {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} regime where patients are prescribed an intense {{course of treatment}} {{for a short period}} of time (the induction phase), followed by a simplified long-term regimen (maintenance). Since induction therapy has a significantly higher chance of pill fatigue than maintenance therapy, patients might take drug holidays during this period. Without guidance, patients who choose to stop therapy will each be making individual decisions, with no scientific basis. Methods We use mathematical modelling to investigate the effect of imperfect adherence during the inductive phase. We address the following research questions: 1. Can we theoretically determine the maximal length of a possible <b>drug</b> <b>holiday</b> and the minimal number of doses that must subsequently be taken while still avoiding resistance? 2. How many drug holidays can be taken during the induction phase? Results For a 180 day therapeutic program, a patient can take several drug holidays, but then has to follow each <b>drug</b> <b>holiday</b> with a strict, but fairly straightforward, drug-taking regimen. Since the results are dependent upon the drug regimen, we calculated the length and number of drug holidays for all fifteen protease-sparing triple-drug cocktails that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Conclusions Induction therapy with partial adherence is tolerable, but the outcome depends on the drug cocktail. Our theoretical predictions are in line with recent results from pilot studies of short-cycle treatment interruption strategies and may be useful in guiding the design of future clinical trials. </p...|$|E
