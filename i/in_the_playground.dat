5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} are often purpose-built {{on a site}} where around 30-40m2 of playing space is available for each child <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> Around 6 m2 per child is allocated indoors. The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.|$|E

5|$|Three {{possible}} excavation {{sites were}} identified: the staff car park of Leicester City Council Social Services, the disused playground {{of the former}} Alderman Newton's School and a public car park on New Street. It was decided to open two trenches in the Social Services car park, with an option for a third <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> Because most of the Greyfriars site had been built on, only seventeen per cent of its former area was available to excavate; the area to be investigated amounted to just one per cent of the site, owing to {{the limitations of the}} project's funding.|$|E
5|$|Hutton {{was born}} on 23 June 1916 in the Moravian {{community}} of Fulneck, Pudsey, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and his wife Lily (née Swithenbank). Many of his family were local cricketers and Hutton soon became immersed in the sport, which he both played and read about with enthusiasm. He practised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> of Littlemoor Council School, which he attended from 1921 until 1930, and at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club, which he joined as a junior. At the age of 12, {{he made his first}} appearance for Pudsey St Lawrence's second eleven and by 1929 had reached the first team. Locals encouraged him to meet the Yorkshire and England cricketer Herbert Sutcliffe, a neighbour, from whom Hutton received coaching in Sutcliffe's garden. Sutcliffe was impressed by the young batsman, and commended him to Yorkshire as a good prospect.|$|E
5|$|Whitney gets {{a job as}} a {{teaching}} assistant at Walford Primary School. During one breaktime, she warns Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles) not to run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> He ignores her and falls over, grazing his arm. Whitney does not react in the professional manner she is supposed to, causing Dennis's injury to be ignored. When Dennis's mother, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer Johnny Carter (Sam Strike), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), hope that Johnny and Whitney will become an item, but his sister Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, the {{original}} building was devastated by a fire, destroying {{most of the}} rooms including the large library, a collection of Byron's notebooks, the trophy room and other classrooms, although the historic facade was mostly undamaged.

25|$|The school {{opened in}} 1992, and {{represents}} the typical board {{school in the}} educational system of the era (the stone built single storey structure being inscribed with the foundation date of 1891, Beamish School Board), by which time attendance at a state approved school was compulsory, but the leaving age was 12, and lessons featured learning by rote and corporal punishment. The building originally stood in East Stanley, having been {{set up by the}} local school board, and would have numbered around 150 pupils. Having been donated by Durham County Council, the museum now has a special relationship with the primary school that replaced it. With separate entrances and cloakrooms for boys and girls at either end, the main building is split into three class rooms (all accessible to visitors), connected by a corridor along the rear.

25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul of a mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E

At the age of 12 he displayed a remarkable passion and talent for cricket and it was through sheer luck that his talent was discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> by a cricket mad teacher, Pete Bolland. Later that year in 1983, he was selected for the Warwickshire Under 13's team where his potential as a leader was spotted very early, resulting in him being awarded the captaincy. Khan was the only state school boy in that team. His determination to succeed was evidenced by the fact that despite having never played hard ball cricket before, he top scored in his first year. Khan only had one dream and that was to make it at the highest grade and play professional cricket. As a young boy, he would find ways to get into Edgbaston to watch Warwickshire play and vowed to his friends that one day, he too would be out there.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac's harsh {{criticism}} of his superiors in the Staff Corps overshadowed his impressive ability to avoid envelopment by the Germans, and he was replaced by Louis Franchet d'Espérey just before {{the opening of the}} First Battle of the Marne. Joffre later recorded that ever since the Battle of Guise, Lanrezac’s normal tendency to criticise and argue about his orders had been exacerbated by fatigue, to the detriment of Fifth Army staff’s morale. Lanrezac’s staff were bickering among themselves. As he could not be counted upon for the planned counterstroke, it was necessary to relieve him on the afternoon of 3 September. The eyewitness accounts of Lanrezac (who claimed that he protested that events had proved him right about most of the issues under dispute, but that Joffre refused to meet his gaze, so that {{it was clear that he}} had exhausted Joffre’s confidence), Joffre (who claimed that Lanrezac immediately agreed and cheered up when relieved of command, in his own office) and Spears (who recalled seeing them having a lengthy and strained conversation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> of the school where Fifth Army HQ was currently based) differ somewhat.|$|E

40|$|In {{assessing}} {{human health}} risk of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), {{it is not}} the concentration of PTEs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environmental matrices that is of greatest concern but the fraction that is absorbed into the body via the exposure pathways. The determination of this fraction (i. e. the bioaccessible fraction) through the application of bioaccessibility protocols is the focus of this work. The study investigated human health risk of PTEs (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) from oral ingestion of soil / dust, inhalation of urban street dust and air-borne dust (PM 10). To assess health risk via oral ingestion of soil and dust, total PTEs were determined in twenty nine soil samples collected from children’s playing fields and ninety urban street dusts collected from six cities. Analysis of total PTE content in these samples via ICP-MS revealed high Pb concentrations (> 450 mg/kg) in 3 playground soils and 32 urban street dusts. Detailed quantitative risk assessment (DQRA) carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playgrounds</b> showed that no significant possibility of significant harm exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>playgrounds.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of Pb from a particular dust sample based on 50 mg/day ingestion rate that a child might possibly ingest to reach the estimated tolerable daily intake was calculated and it exceeded the tolerable daily intake for oral ingestion <b>in</b> 4 cities. <b>The</b> bioaccessible PTEs were determined both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil and dust samples using the Unified BARGE method and the result showed that <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> samples, the PTEs solubilised more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric phase than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intestinal phase.
