40|$|This report {{contains}} a theoretical {{discussion of the}} load distribution in <b>bolted</b> or <b>riveted</b> joints in light-alloy structures which is applicable not only for loads below the limit of proportionality but also for loads above this limit. The theory is developed for double and single shear joints. The methods given are illustrated by numerical examples and the values assumed for the <b>bolt</b> (or <b>rivet)</b> stiffnesses are based partly on theory and partly on known experimental values. It is shown that the load distribution does not vary greatly with the <b>bolt</b> (or <b>rivet)</b> stiffnesses and that for design purposes it is usually sufficient to know their order of magnitude. The theory may also be directly used for spot-welded structures and, with small modifications, for seam-welded structures, The computational work involved in the methods described is simple and may be completed in a reasonable time for most practical problems.

40|$|In Engineering Vibration {{and noise}} {{reduction}} are crucial in maintaining high performance level and prolong use. Structures are generally fabricated {{using a variety}} of shear connectors such as <b>bolts,</b> <b>rivets,</b> etc. The joints {{play a significant role in}} the overall system behaviour. Particularly the damping level of the structures occurs due to energy release due to micro slip along frictional interface between two surfaces, and also because of varying strain region. Some parameter such as end condition, type of joints, number of joints used in structure play significant role in structural vibration analysis. This work was carried out to study effect of number of joints and thickness of layer on material damping with particular end condition. Analysis was carried on various combination of number of <b>bolts</b> and <b>rivets</b> with Aluminium and Mild Steel beam. Using FEA model, natural frequency of various combinations of structural joints was calculated. Various simulations were performed in SOLIDWORKs.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{construction}} of civil engineering structures, two or more members are often rigidly connected to increase the structural integrity. These rigid joints are often designed with <b>bolts,</b> <b>rivets</b> and welding. The actions of in-service loading and environmental effects, or fabrication errors make these joints semirigid, which ultimately reduces the structural reliability. Realistic dynamic analysis of these structures requires accurate modelling of rigidity of joints. Dynamic analysis of plane frames {{can be accomplished by}} combining spectrally formulated Rod and Euler-Bernoulli Beam element. In this study, a six parameter spectral plane frame joint element is formulated using linear and rotational springs to account for semi-rigidity of joints. Methodology and experimental set up for evaluation of dynamic characteristics of connections is discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the repair of advanced composite structures by mechanical fasteners or by adhesive bonding. It is shown {{that many of}} today's composite designs are unreasonably difficult to repair. Conversely, the knowledge to design repairable structures is already available, if only it is applied during the initial design stage. <b>Bolted</b> or <b>riveted</b> repairs require only the avoidance of extremely orthotropic composite fiber patterns; those near the quasi-isotropic layup are the most suitable. Mildly orthotropic fiber patterns are appropriate for structures {{in which there is}} a dominant load direction. Thick composite structures are shown to require <b>bolted</b> or <b>riveted</b> repairs while thin structures favor adhesively bonded permanent repairs, although provisions can be easily made for temporary mechanical repairs. The reasons why integrally stiffened cocured composite designs are usually impractical to repair are explained and alternative repairable design concepts are presented...|$|R
