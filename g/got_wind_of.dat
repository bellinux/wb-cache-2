5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} the ZX81 was catalysed {{in part by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation's plan to produce a TV series, to be {{broadcast}} in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Sinclair <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing {{a new version of the}} ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users (which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 – an indication of how the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations).|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, an {{anthropology}} student, Dr. Roffo, obtained permission to excavate. In pursuance of this, he used explosives to open Jedar B, {{from which he}} obtained a skeleton which was in a wooden coffin in a tomb excavated beneath the building; the same happened {{with one of the}} smaller jedars at Ternaten. The whereabouts of these skeletons is unknown (they may lie unrecognised in an Algerian museum) and Dr. Roffo, it is said, burnt most of his notes in a fit of pique after an argument with the Director of Antiquities (who had probably <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> his methods of 'excavation').|$|E

25|$|On 1 February {{a formal}} {{reconciliation}} was concluded between Ocko tom Brok, {{the town of}} Groningen, Oostergo, Westergo, Hunsingo, Fivelgo, and the small territories of Vredewold, Langewold, and Humsterland. This took place behind John of Bavaria's back, and when he <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> it, he demanded it to be rescinded. But {{at this point he}} had lost almost all his support in the Frisian territories. His last stronghold there was the city of Dokkum, on the north coast, which was held for him mainly by privateers, who preyed on the ships plying the trade route along the North Sea coast. At the end of May a fleet from the cities of Groningen, Hamburg, and Lübeck sailed to Dokkum, and drove the privateers out, thus depriving John of this last foothold on Frisian soil.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} {{list of those}} to be arrested, which was drawn up by RUC Special Branch and MI5, there were 450 names, but only 350 of these were found.

The list included leaders of the non-violent Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association such as Ivan Barr and Michael Farrell.

25|$|Making {{matters worse}} from Penn's perspective, Philip Ford, his {{financial}} advisor, had cheated Penn out {{of thousands of}} pounds by concealing and diverting rents from Penn's Irish lands, claiming losses, then extracting loans from Penn to cover the shortfall. When Ford died in 1702, his widow Bridget threatened to sell Pennsylvania, to which she could prove title. Penn sent William to America to manage affairs, but he proved just as unreliable {{as he had been}} in England. There were considerable discussions about scrapping his constitution. In desperation, Penn tried to sell Pennsylvania to the Crown before Bridget Ford <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> his plan, but by insisting that the Crown uphold the civil liberties that had been achieved, he could not strike a deal. Mrs. Ford took her case to court. At age 62, Penn landed in debtors' prison; however, a rush of sympathy reduced Penn's punishment to house arrest, and Bridget Ford was finally denied her claim to Pennsylvania. A group of Quakers arranged for Ford to receive a payment for back rents and Penn was released.|$|E

25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> the story and decided to write about it as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17.

The Chronicle of Dunmow relates that King John desired Fitzwalter's daughter, Matilda the Fair, and Fitzwalter was forced to take up arms to defend the honour of his daughter. This romantic tale may well be {{propaganda}} giving legitimacy to a rebellion prompted by Fitzwalter's reluctance to pay tax or some other dispute.
