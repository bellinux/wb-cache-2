Sanctions curtailed imports by cutting off Iraq’s petroleum exports, and embargoing those agricultural production inputs deemed to have potential military applications. The Iraqi government responded by monopolizing grain and oilseed marketing, imposing production quotas, and instituting a Public Distribution System for basic foodstuffs. By mid-1991 the government supplied a “basket” of foodstuffs that provided {{about one-third of the}} caloric daily requirement, and cost consumers about five percent of its market value. With subsidies for agricultural inputs diminished, the prices that the government paid to farmers failed to cover their costs. The <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> on agricultural production was estimated to reach 20 to 35 percent by the mid-1990s.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the existence of}} <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in the corporate sector. With this finding, it provides support for the offsetting nature of explicit versus <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Governments continuously provide tax preferences (tax incentives) to firms to induce these firms to alter their investment, production and financing decisions to reallocate resources towards outcomes that the government prefers. Tax preferences lead to lower explicit tax rates for firms that make use of these preferences. However (see Scholes and Wolfson (1992) and Wilkie (1992)), economic theory suggests that in equilibrium all firms must earn the same after-tax return (e. g. ROE). Hence high (low) <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> (tax preference induced adjustments of pre-tax returns) can be expected for firms with low (high) explicit taxes. This paper uses financial statements of 123 listed firms for six years (1991 - 1996) to provide empirical {{evidence on the}} existence of <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in the corporate sector in the Netherlands. The paper finds that the inverse relation between <b>implicit</b> and explicit <b>taxes</b> exists, but is not a strong as expected, suggesting market frictions that prevent the equalisation of after-tax returns. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1958 a {{revolution}} in Venezuela brought an end to their military dictatorship. The newly elected Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, acted to raise the income tax on oil companies and introduced the key aspect {{of supply and demand}} to the oil trade. Nationalization of oil supplies was achieved in 1976. Major oil companies operating in Venezuela have had difficulty with the spreading resource nationalism. After decades of high investment, in the 1960s and 1970s oil taxation of the IOCs (international oil companies) was significantly increased and oil concessions were not renewed. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhilips have said they would walk away from their large investment in the Orinoco heavy-oil belt rather than accept tough new contract terms that raise taxes and oblige all foreign companies to accept minority shares in joint ventures with the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Projects offered to foreign investors were often those that entailed high costs for extraction, leading to lower <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rates. In the late 1990s, private investment substantially increased, adding 1.2 million BD of production by 2005. While private investors were producing more oil and PDSVA decreased oil production, Venezuela still managed to increase its oil fiscal take for each barrel. Continued shortcomings for PDSVA spurred an effort to eliminate the company, leading to a strike that severely reduced investment and production. This gave to government opportunity to seize control and, as a result, {{in the last two years}} the contractual framework of the oil opening has been significantly changed, considerably increasing the government-take and control over private investments.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{cross-border}} dividend-stripping transactions that gave rise to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Compaq v. Commissioner and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in IES Industries v. Commissioner. In both cases, the circuit courts held for the taxpayers and rejected the Commissioner’s claim that the transactions lacked economic substance because the taxpayers were sure to lose money on the transactions before taxes. These cases generated extensive commentary that was split into two diametrically opposed camps. One group argued that the decisions were correct because the transactions were economically profitable business transactions. The other group argued that the transactions were blatant, abusive tax shelters; and that the courts should have struck them down. Because the commentators in the second group conceded that the transactions generated a pre-tax profit, these commentators also offered a range of proposals to modify or replace the pre-tax profit test. Although the tax benefit of crossborder dividend-stripping was sharply reduced by subsequent Congressional enactments, that action hid rather than resolved the issue whether the tax shelter jurisprudence is fundamentally flawed because there is a class of abusive transactions that produce a guaranteed profit before tax, but do not run afoul of the anti-abuse provisions in the tax law. This paper argues that the Compaq and IES Industries transactions do not reveal any fundamental failings with either anti-abuse jurisprudence generally or the pre-tax profit test in particular. This paper demonstrates that the circuit courts reached the wrong conclusions in those cases because the parties, the courts, and the commentators all ignored <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> That is not surprising because the <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in these cases were difficult to see. These <b>taxes</b> were negative <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes,</b> which drove down the cum dividend price of the stripped stock, and therefore made the transactions appear profitable before <b>taxes.</b> However, once <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> are taken into account, the transactions in those cases are properly understood to be unprofitable before taxes. Finally, nearly ten years ago, Charlotte Crane observed that tax doctrine has all but ignored <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> and she challenged commentators, lawyers and judges to think carefully about how <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> can be incorporated into tax doctrine. My proposal to calculate pre-tax profit for the purpose of anti-abuse jurisprudence before both <b>implicit</b> and explicit <b>taxes</b> is, I believe, the first proposal to explicitly recognize <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in tax doctrine...|$|R

Additionally, doubt is cast over the validity of Callihan and White’s finding that implicit taxes are lower for firms possessing market power...|$|E
40|$|During {{the recent}} flat tax debate, {{interest}} rates on long-term municipal bonds rose relative to the rate on U. S. Treasury bonds.

This study assesses that question by examining the relationship between the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rate and actual future tax rates. > Efficient markets theory predicts that the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rate [...] the tax rate that equates the after-tax yield on a Treasury bond to the yield on a tax-exempt bond [...] will be an excellent predictor of future tax rates.
