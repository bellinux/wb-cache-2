40|$|The {{heavy duty}} Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) inter-laboratory {{exercise}} {{consists of three}} parts: 1) the exploratory work to refine the measurement protocol, 2) the validation exercise where each lab will measure the emissions of a ¿golden¿ engine with two ¿golden¿ particle number systems simultaneously sampling from <b>full</b> and partial <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>systems,</b> and 3) the round-robin where the emissions of a ¿reference¿ engine will be determined with a lab¿s own particle number instrumentation. This paper {{presents the results of}} the exploratory work and describes the final protocol for testing in the validation exercise (and round robin) along with the necessary facility modifications required for compliance with the protocol. Key aspects of the protocol (e. g. filter material, flow rates at the <b>full</b> and partial <b>flow</b> systems, the pre-conditioning etc.) are explained and justified. Finally, the results of particle emissions measurements during the World harmonized and the European cycles are given focusing on volatility and the presence of non-volatile materials above and below 23 nm.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} type of {{dilution tunnel}} is chosen, {{based on the}} international standards, user's needs and the manufacturer's requirements. During the design process, a number of restrictions specified in the standards for emission and Venturis were taken into account. The data required to address basic concepts were obtained from numerous emission tests performed at the IMR Institute. A short algorithm of calculation of the critical flow Venturi (CFV) is also presented. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the problems of the measurement of particulate emissions using the dilution method, which does not allow us to use the unique thermodynamic and flow parameters. A method of evaluation of particulate emissions for two extreme cases which were expected during the tests was adopted. Using the results of calculations, a <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> tunnel with CFV was manufactured and tested at the IMR Institute...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (<b>full</b> <b>flow,</b> partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> tunnel. The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|The Heavy-duty Inter-Laboratory Correlation Exercise has {{concluded}} testing at 5 test laboratories in the EU {{in order to}} demonstrate the practicality, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility of the particle emissions measurement techniques proposed by the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). A CRT equipped heavy duty engine was transported to each lab were it was tested over multiple European and the World Harmonized Stationary and Transient Test Cycles. Along with the engine, two Golden Particle Measurement Systems (GPMS) were shipped to permit particle number {{measurements to be made}} simultaneously from both <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> constant volume sampler (CVS) <b>dilution</b> and partial <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> (PFDS) <b>systems.</b> Measurements of solid particle number emissions, particulate mass and regulated gaseous emissions were taken over each test.

40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from the full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the raw exhaust, thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for raw exhaust measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for raw exhaust sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

40|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{introduced}} a limit for non-volatile particle number (PN) emissions > 23 nm from light-duty vehicles and the stated {{intent is to}} implement similar legislation for on-road heavy-duty engines at the next legislative stage. This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order 5 % and higher scatter of the results could easily {{be explained by the}} effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e. g. the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30 %. These high variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments and drifts of the PN systems (especially those of the Particle Number Counters - PNCs) over time. Correlation measurements between the full dilution tunnels (Constant Volume Samplers - CVS) and the proportional Partial <b>Flow</b> <b>Dilution</b> <b>Systems</b> (PFDS) showed agreement within 15 % for the PN method down to 1 x 1011 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based Particulate (matter) Mass (PM) and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1 - 2 mg/km for light-duty vehicles and also 2 - 3 mg/kWh for heavy-duty applications. The correlation improves when only elemental carbon mass is considered: It is relatively good down to 0. 1 - 0. 3 mg/km or mg/kWh; one order of magnitude below the PM levels. JRC.

40|$|Indicator {{dilution}} techniques permit {{accurate measurements}} of important cardiovascular parameters, such as pulmonary blood volume (PBV) and ejection fraction (EF). However, their use {{is limited by}} the need for central catheterization. Contrast ultrasonography allows overcoming this problem. PBV and EF can be measured by a <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> identification algorithm after detection of multiple dilution curves by an ultrasound scanner. In this paper, we present a system identification method that exploits the a priori knowledge on the <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> and finds the optimum parameters for the parametric model representing the <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> impulse response. No subsequent model interpolation is needed. Volume measurements show accurate in-vitro results and clinical feasibility, while 50 EF measurements in patients show a 0. 88 correlation coefficient with echocardiographic biplane estimates. In conclusion, adding a priori knowledge to the system identification algorithm leads to increased accuracy and robustness of the method for PBV and EF measurements...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel method for urine culture for office practice based {{on the use of}} filter paper as a solid-phase dilution device. Filtration dilutes and spreads the inoculum onto a solid culture surface. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimum inoculum size, microbial permeability through filter papers, and ability to exclude vaginal epithelial cells. The filter paper <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> was compared to the standard streak method to detect bacteriuria in specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory. The sensitivity and specificity of the filter paper <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> for detection of high-count (≥ 104 CFU/ml) gram-negative bacteriuria in 487 urine specimens were 98. 2 and 97. 4 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for gram-positive bacteriuria in 404 urine specimens were 91. 2 and 99. 2 %, respectively. Low-count gram-negative bacteriuria (< 104 CFU/ml) was detected by the filter paper <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> in five of nine specimens (55. 6 %). In addition, the filter paper <b>dilution</b> <b>system</b> was able to detect gram-negative bacteria in 12 of 41 (29. 3 %) mixed cultures. Lactobacillus and Gardnerella organisms in urine specimens were excluded by the filter paper <b>dilution</b> <b>system.</b> Only three of eight Candida sp. isolates were detected at counts of ≥ 104 CFU/ml. The system has good storage properties and can be inoculated at the point of source without the need for refrigeration or preservatives. It should be a useful screening method for office practice, where members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci cause most infections. Standard culture methods are preferred for hospital diagnostic microbiology laboratories, where {{there is a need to}} detect yeasts and fastidious microorganisms and to isolate individual colonies from mixed cultures...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the LD inter-laboratory {{exercise}} were reported during 2007 (Andersson et al. 2007). 	The HD exercise consists of three parts: ¿	The exploratory work at JRC for {{the definition of the}} measurement protocol. It includes system and sample backgrounds, filter media and filter face velocity effects, preconditioning, comparisons of different particle number systems, and investigation of the particle number instruments. ¿	The validation exercise for the evaluation of particle number repeatability and reproducibility using the same measurement systems at all labs (Golden Systems). In the validation exercise, an engine (Golden Engine) will be circulated along with two Golden Systems used to simultaneously sample from full (FFDS) and partial <b>flow</b> exhaust <b>dilution</b> (PFDS) <b>systems</b> respectively. The Golden Engineer and project manager will ensure that the participating labs closely follow the measurement protocol. Low sulphur fuel and lubricant from single batches will be used at all labs. The participating labs are JRC (I), AVL_MTC (S), RICARDO (UK), UTAC (F), and EMPA (CH). JRC tested first and will also measure last to demonstrate consistency of measurement systems and test engine. ¿	The round robin exercise for the evaluation of particle number repeatability and reproducibility using different systems. In the round robin, a reference engine will circulate, but each lab will use its own particle number systems from FFDS and optionally from PFDS. All labs will use fuel and lubricant of the same type (but not from the same batch). The participating labs are from EU, Japan, Korea and Canada.
