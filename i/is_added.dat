We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

5|$|Another example {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxin. CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is inserted into a linearised plasmid vector.

5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium <b>is</b> <b>added</b> to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium <b>is</b> <b>added</b> to the molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due {{to the formation of}} discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{workability}} and {{corrosion resistance}} {{of iron and}} chromium are increased by adding gadolinium; the creep resistance of nickel is improved {{with the addition of}} thorium.

5|$|To {{improve the}} {{leaching}} {{process in the}} gold cyanidation, lead(II) nitrate solution <b>is</b> <b>added.</b> Although a bulk process, only limited amounts (10 to 100milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) are required. Both the cyanidation itself, {{as well as the}} use of lead compounds in the process, are deemed controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.|$|E
