40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} the normal anatomic relationships of retinal vessel diameters with optic disc, macula, and retinal nerve fiber layer parameters in young children. Methods. This was a population-based, cross-sectional study of 1204 healthy children 6 {{years of age}} who were participating in the Sydney Childhood Eye Study. Retinal arteriolar <b>and</b> venular <b>diameters</b> were measured from fundus photographs using standardized computer-based methods. Optical coherence tomography was performed to obtain measurements of the optic disc, macula, and retinal nerve fiber layer parameters. Results. In multivariate analyses, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in optic disc area {{was associated with a}} 0. 14 -pixel decrease (P = 0. 05) <b>in</b> arteriolar <b>diameter</b> <b>and</b> a 0. 31 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> venular <b>diameter.</b> Each SD decrease in optic cup area was associated with a 0. 15 -pixel decrease (P = 0. 05) <b>in</b> arteriolar <b>diameter</b> <b>and</b> a 0. 43 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> venular <b>diameter.</b> Each SD decrease in macular (inner/outer) thickness or volume was associated with a 0. 25 - to 0. 39 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> arteriolar <b>diameter</b> <b>and</b> a 0. 36 - to 0. 71 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> venular <b>diameter,</b> <b>and</b> each SD decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was associated with a 0. 62 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> arteriolar <b>diameter</b> <b>and</b> a 0. 99 -pixel decrease (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> venular <b>diameter.</b> Conclusions. Children&# 8217;s eyes with a smaller optic disc, thinner macula, and thinner retinal nerve fiber layer have narrower retinal vessels. These anatomic relationships may provide new insights into the vascular etiology of various ocular diseases...|$|R

5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America.

The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> <b>and</b> supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E

Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E

5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> <b>and</b> occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E
