5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{launched}} a website, called abeautifullie.org, {{to provide information}} about environmental issues and ways to participate in environmental activities. People can make donations through the site to support the Natural Resources Defense Council. In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for , a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. During their Welcome to the Universe Tour, the group worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption to offset the impact that the tour would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> the environment.|$|E
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> a pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E

25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|On Cape Cod, marsh creek {{banks are}} often so riddled with Sesarma burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further {{burrowing}} and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008). Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus {{lead to the}} retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod {{have resulted in the}} loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss. The detrimental effects trophic cascades <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> marshes not only reduce the biodiversity, health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.|$|E

25|$|Eiseley {{published}} {{works in}} a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts. His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley’s essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father’s hobby as an amateur Shakespearean actor may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Eiseley’s writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.|$|E
25|$|After various {{petitions}} from Landano {{and various}} hearings, {{a federal judge}} released Landano from prison in 1989 after Landano served 13 {{years of his life}} sentence {{on the grounds that the}} prosecution had systematically withheld evidence. On March 12, 1992, a New Jersey Court of Appeals ordered an evidentiary hearing to consider claims stemming from documents that two people, including a witness at the trial, failed to identify a photo of Landano, the police department's report that a witness identified Victor Forni as the driver of the getaway car and not Landano, and the failure to submit this information to Landano and his defense team before the trial began. The New Jersey Court of Appeals also ordered the hearing to investigate any impact that any potentially lost or damaged materials could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> the trial.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{spends his}} last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his {{colleague}} in his new position. Dr. Yealland uses electro-shock therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients {{do not want to}} be cured and that pain is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients. Rivers questions whether he can work with a man who uses such techniques. Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job. The novel ends with Rivers completing his notes, meditating on the effect that the encounter with Sassoon, and the last few months, <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|E

25|$|Einem's defence team (now {{consisting}} of barrister David Peek with assistance from Helena Jasinski) appealed the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia and requested {{that a new}} trial be set. The basis for this appeal was the evidence given about Kelvin's heterosexuality, the references to Einem's own homosexuality through the trial and the negative impact that might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> the jury, and also how Mr. Justice White in his summation did not include reference to the testimony given by Einem's relative about his attendance at the birthday party on the day Kelvin's body was dumped. The Court of Criminal of Appeal rejected the appeal, saying that the trial was conducted fairly and just throughout, however they did concede that Mr. Justice White should have included the evidence relating to the birthday party.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war, {{it was already}} mobilizing {{resources}} from academic, industry and military sectors {{for research and development}} into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research center was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited. The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in a number of attacks. The Artillery used Mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions. The United States began large-scale production of an improved vesicant gas known as Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain what effect this new chemical would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield, however, as it degrades in moist conditions.|$|E
25|$|The farm is {{equipped}} with three tractors which would have all seen service during the war - a Case, a Fordson N and a 1924 Fordson F. The farm also features horse drawn traps, reflecting the effect wartime rationing of petrol would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> car use. The farming equipment in the cart and machinery sheds reflects the transition of the time from horse drawn to tractor pulled implements, with some older equipment put back into use due to the war, {{as well as a}} large Foster thresher, vital for cereal crop, and built specifically for the war effort, sold at the Newcastle Show. Although the wartime focus was on crops, the farm also features breeds of sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry that would have been typical for the time. The farm also has a portable steam engine, not in use, but presented as having been left out for collection as part of a wartime scrap metal drive.|$|E

25|$|That same year, Robert F. Kennedy {{was widely}} {{considered}} an impeccable choice {{to run as}} Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn. Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Kennedy as his running mate. Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent {{in the office of}} vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} created issues among getting hired {{for jobs and}} losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary {{to those of the}} employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions. Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to Silicon Republic's statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile. This shows the effects that social networks <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement. In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the Secret Service.|$|E
