40|$|Abstract: A {{comparative}} study of 36 molecular descriptors derived from the topological distance matrix and van der Waals space is carried out within this paper. They are partitioned into 16 generalized topological <b>distance</b> matrix <b>indices,</b> 11 topological <b>distance</b> <b>indices</b> known in the literature (seven obtained from eigenvalues/eigenvectors of distance matrix), and 9 van der Waals molecular descriptors. The generalized topological <b>distance</b> <b>indices,</b> k δλ (λ = 1 – 3, k = 1 – 4), are introduced in this work {{on the basis of}} reciprocical distance matrix. Intercorrelation analysis reveals that topological <b>distance</b> <b>indices</b> mostly contain the same type of information, while van der Waals indices can be bound to the shape or the size of molecules. Furthermore, we found that topological <b>distance</b> <b>indices</b> are good for describing molecular size, and they may be viewed as bulk parameters. The most accurate QSPR models for predicting boiling point of alkanes are based on some of the generalized, eigenvalues/eigenvectors topological <b>distance</b> <b>indices</b> and the van der Waals descriptors of molecular size.

50|$|Malaysia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels of power distance, with a score of 100 on Hofstede’s Power <b>Distance</b> <b>Index</b> (PDI). This signifies that Malaysians would {{generally}} consent to, and not question, hierarchies in which everyone has a place. They would perceive hierarchy in organisations as mirroring intrinsic inequalities. Leaders are expected to be autocratic, and to instruct their subordinates on what to do. Malaysian society is often centralised, and opposition to authority is generally not welcomed.|$|E
50|$|The Power <b>Distance</b> <b>Index</b> is {{designed}} to measure ‘the extent to which power differs within the society, organization and institutions (like the family) are accepted by the less powerful members’. It indicates the level of power distance and dependent relationships in a country by assigning a score to each country. The PDI also represents society's level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. As Hofstede stressed, there is no absolute value and PDI is useful only as a method to compare countries.|$|E

Power distance indicates how society handles inequalities among people. Countries that have high power distance accept the hierarchical order {{in which people are}} in different levels / places and there is no further justification. Therefore inequalities of power and wealth distribution are allowed in the society. On the other hand, countries having low power distance are support equality and demand justification for inequalities of power. In these societies, equality and opportunity for everyone is highly reinforced.|$|E

This paper focuses on measuring Hofstede’s power <b>distance</b> <b>index</b> for Kazakh culture. A novel technique is proposed, where verbal index is calculated from analysis of publically available texts delivered by representatives of different cultures. In particular, we analyzed public speeches delivered by leaders ofNew Zealand,UK,Germany,Australia,USA,Greece,China,India, andKazakhstan. From these texts we derived a verbal index, which closely correlated to Hofstede’s power distance data. As a result, we were able to obtain a power <b>distance</b> <b>index</b> of 58 forKazakhstan, which was previously unavailable in literature. Furthermore, this method {{can be used as a}} cheaper alternative to conducting surveys in estimating Hofstede’s power distance indexes for different cultures...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} are suitable tools for optimal management in many forested areas. In this research, {{the effect of}} conservation on spatial pattern of dominant trees has been studied. To achieving this purpose, protected and non- protected forests were selected in Masal region of Guilan province as the study area. Sampling methods including fixed- area plots and distance methods, such as T- square and compound sampling were used 25 circle sample plots, each with an area 1000 m 2 and 25 sampling points were taken. Then, tree species in plot samples and the distance of interest were identified and measured.

Statistical analysis used to analyse the data collected include cluster analysis, correlation analysis, similarity and <b>distance</b> <b>indices.</b> The pollen grains are spheroidal to oblate to sub-oblate in shape. They are aperturate, both colpate and porate. Tricolpate types occur most frequently, acolpate, monocolpate, bicolpate and tetracolpate types less frequently. The multicolpate and multiporate attributes in all the species indicate that the genus is not primitive in evolutionary history and this species probably, evolved around in the same time. According to the size, the pollen grains of the genus falls into groups permagna (pollen diameter 100 - 200 ?m) and giganta (pollen diameter greater than 200 ?m). S. cayennensis and S. anguistifolia belong to group permagna and S. indica only in the group giganta. This separates S. indica from the other two species.
