50|$|In {{terms of}} imaging, SHIM has several {{advantages}} over the traditional {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Owing to the very high source brightness, and the short De Broglie wavelength of the helium ions, which is inversely proportional to their momentum, {{it is possible to}} obtain qualitative data not achievable with conventional microscopes which use photons or electrons as the <b>emitting</b> <b>source.</b> As the helium ion beam interacts with the sample, it does not suffer from a large excitation volume, and hence provides sharp images with a large depth of field {{on a wide range of}} materials. Compared to an SEM, the secondary electron yield is quite high, allowing for imaging with currents as low as 1 femtoamp. The detectors provide information-rich images which offer topographic, material, crystallographic, and electrical properties of the sample. In contrast to other ion beams, there is no discernible sample damage due to relatively light mass of the helium ion. The drawback is the cost.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{an optimal}} <b>emitting</b> <b>source</b> {{location}} {{based on the}} time of arrival (TOA) measurements is one of the important problems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The nonlinear least-squares (NLS) estimation technique is employed to obtain the location of an <b>emitting</b> <b>source.</b> This optimization problem has been formulated by the minimization of the sum of squared residuals between estimated and measured data as the objective function. This paper presents a hybridization of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the determination of the global optimum solution with the local search Newton-Raphson (NR) method. The corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the localization errors is derived, which gives a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator. Simulation results under different signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions show that the proposed hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Newton-Raphson (GA-NR) improves the accuracy and efficiency of the optimal solution compared to the regular GA.
