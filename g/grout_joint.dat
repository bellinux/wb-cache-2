40|$|An {{experimental}} {{research on the}} bond between masonry units and grout {{has been carried out}} at the National Technical University of Athens. In this study, tension and shear tests on composite substrate/grout specimens were performed. The composite specimens were consisted of two pieces of substrate connected with one <b>grout</b> <b>joint.</b> The substrate was either stone or brick, whereas hydraulic lime or tripartite (lime-pozzolan cement) or cement grouts were used. The experimental results have demonstrated that the developed tensile and shear bond strength of the studied hydraulic lime and tripartite grouts is comparable with those of cement-based grouts. Moreover, the value of the reached bond strength (tensile or shear) is governed mainly by the substrate characteristics and the binding properties of the grouts. It was also found that interfaces subjected to shear exhibited similar behaviour with interfaces within concrete; thus the beneficial effect of normal compressive stress on the interface was confirmed. Finally, the experimental results are used for the formulation of a Mohr-Coulomb criterion for grout to travertine joints in shear-compression and shear-tension. The results of this project clearly confirm the efficiency of grouts with medium or low mechanical properties (tripartite and hydraulic lime grouts) for retrofitting historic masonries. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|A pre-grouted rock mass is {{subjected}} to stress re-distribution as the tunnel excavation progresses. The strength and deformation characteristics of <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> are therefore of interest in any effort to predict the rock mechanical behavior {{as well as the}} failure of sealing in a grouted rock mass. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the basic behavior of <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> and to study its rock mechanical interaction. Direct shear tests were performed on both grouted and ungrouted, identical high-strength rock joint replicas while injecting water in the joint plane. The tests were done under normal stresses between 2 and 4 MPa with cement grouts having water-cement ratios between 0. 7 and 0. 9. The obtained results were then fitted and used for numerical modeling of representative tunneling situations. The grouted cement affects the joint shear strength in two ways; a cohesive part is added and the friction is reduced. Grout sealing failure of a joint {{subjected to}} shear displacement occurs as a consequence of dilation. Test results indicated that the shear strength of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> were reduced up to 25 % and seepage commenced when the range of elastic, relative shear displacement was exceeded. The results implied that for most applications, that the peak shear strength of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> can be regarded {{as a function of the}} rock contact friction and grout bond strength, using a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The grout sealing failure occurs concurrently with the shear failure. It was concluded from the numerical modeling that, shear displacement in a single, adversely located joint represents a possible seepage path. The most common adverse joint location was found to be parallel with the principal shear stress. It was also concluded that the secondary compressive stress field after tunnel excavation increased the joint shear strength and suppresses the dilation that causes grout sealing failure...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{behaviour}} of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> {{has been}} studied {{in the recent past}} using the conventional direct shear apparatus, where the normal load on the joint plane is kept constant during testing. The Constant Normal Stiffness (CNS) condition is adopted in this study of shear behaviour of bolted joints, as the CNS condition represents a better approximation of the deformation behaviour of <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> in underground excavations as compared to the conventional Constant Normal Load (CNL) condition. A series of tests were conducted to study the behaviour of these stabilised joints under constant normal stiffness condition at an initial normal stress ranging from 0. 13 MPa to 3. 25 MPa, using a large scale CNS testing machine at a controlled strain rate of 0. 5 mm/min. An analytical model has been developed to predict the shear resistance of bolted joints using the Fourier Series. The shear resistance of the bolted joint was defined {{as a function of the}} applied initial normal stress, the normal stiffness of the surrounding rock mass and the shear stiffness of the bolt. Fourier series was used to formulate the dilation behaviour during shearing, which in effect was utilized to predict the variation of normal stress during test process. Thus, using the analytical model, the complete stress profile for the bolted joint could be predicted at any normal stress and stiffness condition.

40|$|Field {{data suggest}} that stress level and joint {{condition}} af-fect shear-wave propagation in jointed rock masses. Howev-er, the study of long-wavelength propagation in a jointed rock mass is challenging in the laboratory, and limited data are available under controlled test conditions. Long-wavelength P-wave and S-wave propagation normal to joints, using an axially loaded jointed column device, reproduces a range of joint conditions. The effects of the normal stress, loading his-tory, joint spacing, matched surface topography i. e., joint roughness, joint cementation e. g., after <b>grouting,</b> <b>joint</b> opening, and plasticity of the joint filling on the P-wave and S-wave velocities and onS-wave attenuation are notable. The ratio VP /VS in jointed rock masses differs from that found in homogeneous continua. The concept of Poisson’s ratio as a function ofVP /VS is unwarranted, andVP /VS can be interpret-ed in terms of jointed characteristics. Analytic models that consider stress-dependent stiffness and frictional loss in joints as well as stress-independent properties of intact rocks can model experimental observations properly and extract joint properties from rock-mass test data.

In this paper the 3 D numerical modelling to simulate the laser grout removal of a ceramic tile and its backing layer and adjacent grout was carried out. Thermal stress analysis by the finite element method using the ADINA package was used to predict removal behaviour of the grout and its integrity with the tile and backing layer.

40|$|Object of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is the effect of}} grout in the shear behavior of rock joints. The methodology of research included comparative studies of behavior of <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> (change of factors and study of relative effect). The comparative regards were based on elements by numerical simulations and experimental measurements of the <b>grouted</b> rock <b>joints</b> behavior. The results of the numerical analyses are: Small thickness of <b>grout</b> increases the <b>joint</b> shear strength. After a critical thickness of the grout (~ 5 mm) the joint shear strength remains constant or presents relative reduction. The increase of joint shear strength due to the presence of grout is at 1. 5 - 2. 0 times bigger in rough rock joints. The observation concerns identical rough rock joints replicas while in natural the rate of increase is smaller or almost null. The results of the experimental studies are the following: Small thickness of grout (< 5 mm) causes improvement of peak joint shear strength. The presence of grout does not influence the residual joint shear strength. The rate of increase of the peak joint shear strength depends from the roughness of the rock joints and it tends to zero with increase of roughness. The results of the numerical analyses and the experimental studies show that the natural characteristics of rock joints that influence the shear behavior are: Τhe joint roughness (the effective joint roughness coefficient -JRCeff- will be smaller from the initial), the stength of the rock and of the grout (it will be selected depending on the case receiving the minimal price from the two) and the residual joint friction angle Φr, which is equal with the joint friction angle of the grout or with the average of the friction angle of rock and grout. Taking into account all the above, it is proposed the following formulation of Barton-Bandis shear strength failure criterion: τpeak = Ci + σn tan [JRC(eff) log 10 (UCS(eff) /σn) +Φr(eff) ]. ...|$|R

This interface {{is made up of}} the backside of the ceramic tile, tile adhesive and the waterproof membrane. In every day used bathrooms water will accumulate in this particular environment. It is calculated that a tiled wall exposed to water in 15 minutes needs approximately six months to dry out since water is sucked, by capillary actions, through the <b>grout</b> <b>joints</b> between the ceramic tiles. The wall dries through diffusion forces and diffusion force is a weaker than capillary force and therefore the drying need longer time than the wetting of the wall with a water accumulation in the interface as a result. Samples were taken from areas where the wall and floor had been exposed to free water regularly, due to showering. Mould and/or bacterial growth was found on 69 % of the analysed specimens from the most water exposed places in the bathrooms. No such growth was found on the samples from the dryer areas. The results shows that although the environment behind the tiles may seem to disadvantaged for microbial growth, due to a limited amount of organic substances and due to pH values not favourable for microbial growth, such growth is possible when the moisture conditions are high.

The tie connections are essential for the structural integrity and can contribute to the formation of alternative load-bearing systems in case of local damages of the structure. The aim of the present research was to develop a method for prediction of the load-displacement characteristics of tie connections in the plastic stage. Tie connections between concrete elements were studied experimentally. The load-displacement relationship and the strain distribution along the tie bar were evaluated from measurements. In most of the tests it was possible to obtain large plastic deformations and the ultimate displacement was determined by the rupture of the reinforcing steel. The anchorage capacity of tie bars anchored in <b>grouted</b> <b>joints</b> between hollow core elements was studied in separate test series. A numerical approach was developed for the analysis of tie connections in the plastic stage. The local bond-slip behaviour of the steel-to-concrete interface and the strain hardening of the steel were considered in the analysis. The bond-slip relationships that are recommended today could not be used in the calculations as the yield penetration along the embedded tie bar and, as a result, the displacement was considerably underestimated. Modified bond-slip relationships are proposed which take into account the yielding of the steel. It was found that the load-displacement relationship often had the same proportions as long as ductile types of tie bars were used even when the strength of steel and concrete varied substantially. The relative strain energy was defined and was found to be a valuable parameter describing the ductile behaviour of tie connections. An approach for the analysis of alternative load-bearing system is presented and exemplified. The approach is based on a condition of energy equilibrium. It is shown how the dynamic resistance of an alternative load-bearing system is affected by the ductility and the deformability of tie connections.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} subjects {{related to}} the choice of agrouting method in a jointed hard rock mass. By calculating thetotal sealing time to reach the requested sealing level,different grouting methods could be compared and the mostfavourable chosen. A methodology, to calculate the sealing time for differentgrouting methods in different rock masses has been developed. Five main activities {{are included in the}} methodology; drilling,grouting, waiting, probing and re-grouting, which to differingdegrees contribute to the total sealing time. In addition, anextra activity, post-grouting, is regarded separately, as thepost-grouting time normally is not included in the totalsealing time. Within the different activities, subjects such asrock mass properties, examination of rock mass, groutingtechnique, grout mix and the different waiting times have beenstudied. In practice, the application of the methodology requiresthat the average time and variance for each activity on a fanlevel is expressed. The times for each activity are then addedtogether to achieve the total time for a fan. After which, thetime for each fan is added over the entire tunnel length tocalculate the total sealing time for a tunnel. E. g. for the <b>grouting</b> activity, <b>joints</b> belonging to agrouting fan are randomly selected from a joint aperturedistribution for the appropriate rock mass. For each joint in afan, distributions are calculated for parameters such asinflow, time and grouting volumes as e. g. sealing time andsealing effect. Then a Monte Carlo simulation based on thesedistributions and for each grouting fan is carried out and theaverage grouting time and variance calculated. To test the methodology, numerical calculations for threegrouting methods and in three rock masses have been carriedout. The most favourable grouting method is defined as themethod which fulfils the requirement in the shortest sealingtime. By analysing the result of the numerical calculations, ithas been shown that other activities besides grouting oftenhave a large impact on the total sealing time. To choosebetween pre-grouting and post-grouting is regarded as adecision problem, which is strongly related to other activitiesof the tunnel production cycle. A strong relationship was shownbetween the possibility to seal and the chosen grouting methodand grout mix. A long grouting time is not always equivalent toa good sealing result and the opposite has shown to bepossible. Further, calculations have shown that a correct combinationof hole spacing, grout penetration length and appropriatepumping time is essential for a good sealing result. Inaddition, this thesis has demonstrated a method as to how thiscorrect combination should be chosen in order to achieve anoptimal grouting solution.

40|$|Grouting is {{a common}} method of sealing rock around tunnels to reduce or stop water inflow. Successful {{grouting}} significantly minimizes the maintenance cost and safety of the tunnel. Some questions about bleeding and penetrability of the grouts have to be examined more closely {{to carry out a}} successful grouting. Bleeding of cement-based grout is a complex problem. Measuring methods used today originate from the measuring of the bleeding of cement pastes used in ordinary building industry. Whether bleeding measured with a standard method is relevant for bleeding in small fractures in rocks {{is one of the main}} questions in this study. The aim of the study is to illustrate what really happens with a grout during bleeding and which factors and processes influence it. In this way relevant measuring methods can be developed as well as the knowledge regarding interpretation of the measured results. The study has shown the most important factors which governs bleeding in cement-based grout. It has also shown that the results measured with standard methods are not relevant for bleeding of <b>grout</b> in rock <b>joints</b> and that voids in the joints caused by bleeding could be refilled during grouting itself. An important aspect of grouting is penetration of the grout. The penetration is defined as the length of how far grout penetrates in the rock through fractures from a bore hole. Filtration of the grout is a result of a plug building at fracture constrictions which reduces the penetrability of the grout. This is the other important issue discussed in the study which examines the question whether this can be measured by some measuring method and which factors and processes influence penetrability and filtration. A hypothesis of how the factors w/c ratio, pressure and relative constriction influence penetrability are presented and tested by special constructed measuring equipment. The results obtained by this measuring equipment are compared with the results measured with a penetrability meter. QC 2010070...|$|R
40|$|Development in {{grouting}} {{technique and}} its material causes an increasingly demand of its using in geotechnical constructions. To evaluate the grouting effect, a laboratory or field test towards {{the physical and}} mechanical properties of grouted soil and rock is needed. One of methods for evaluate grouting distribution is geoelectric or resistivity sounding method. This study is purposed to identify the subsurface resistivity change of study area before and after grouting using resistivity data from resistivity sounding method. Evaluation towards grouting effect can be determined by comparing the resistivity value change before and after grouting. Grouting effect and its distribution in soil and rock is analysed using isoresistivity map before and after grouting. Methods {{used in this study}} are survey and descriptive method supported by literature references for determine geological and geotechnical characteristics of study area. Geoelectric measurement uses Schlumberger’s configuration array. Resistivity data before and after grouting is used to interpret subsurface section along the study area. Based on this data, the resistivity value change before and after grouting can be analysed. Isoresistivity map is needed to determine the grouting distribution at various definite depths. Type of soil is mould soil which is loose, not compacted, and has uneven density along this area. Otherwise, tuffaceous sand and tuff characterized with cracks and <b>joints.</b> <b>Grouting</b> is needed to fix these weaknesses. Data analysis shows there is a relatively decrease in resistivity value after grouting, which is mould soil has average value 27. 43 ohm meter before grouting, decrease to 23. 66 ohm meter after grouting; tuffaceous sandstone decrease from average value 22. 15 ohm meter to 17. 13 ohm meter; tuff decrease from average value 11. 70 to 8. 36 ohm meter. Depth of grouting distribution can reach 7 meter depth, which is minimum 1 meter vertically from injection depth. Lateral distribution of grouting material can covers all of this grouted area with 3 meters spacing. Medium of grouting distribution is pore spaces in mould soil, otherwise cracks and pore spaces in tuffaceous sandstone and tuff...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive testing (NDT) uses {{different}} {{wave propagation}} modes {{to evaluate the}} internal structure of materials, revealing internal damage such as corrosion and fracturing that cannot be detected by traditional methods. Civil infrastructures are considered high priority assets in Ontario and Canada because of their value, high consequence of failure, and the continual influence of aging effects. Unexpected failure of infrastructure not only costs more than planned replacements but also results in increased safety risks. The in-situ condition assessment of civil infrastructure is critical for the successful implementation of maintenance and safety programs. Therefore, reliable nondestructive methods of inspection are required {{for the implementation of}} economical and efficient maintenance and asset management programs. Continuing technological developments in data collection, acquisition equipment, and data processing techniques have provided useful applications of nondestructive methods in many engineering fields. Among the many applications, this research study examines three applications of nondestructive testing in civil engineering: (1) condition assessment of construction joints in asphalt pavements, (2) average thickness evaluation of steel pipes, and (3) void and debonding detection in grouted steel tanks. The study on asphalt focuses on the improvement of the coupling system between the transducers and the asphalt surface, {{and the development of a}} new data processing technique to reduce user input and increase the reliability of the condition assessment of longitudinal joints. The current wavelet transmission coefficient (WTC) method requires user input, making the automatic data processing difficult. In the WTC method, the coupling between the transducers and the asphalt surface requires the use of epoxy and aluminum plates. This procedure is not practical for testing in-service roads. A new coupling mechanism using polyurethane foam to provide a spring action on the transducers and calibrated weights to generate a compression force was developed and showed good results, reducing the testing time by up to 50 %. A new and robust data analysis methodology, called instantaneous transmission coefficient (ITC), is proposed based on measured instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios. The main advantage of the ITC procedure is that it can be performed automatically, reducing user input. A laboratory scale asphalt slab is used to evaluate the new methodology. Results show good agreement between the WTC and ITC measurements for both jointed and joint-free areas. The second study investigates the feasibility of the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) technique for the evaluation of the average wall thickness of steel pipes. Electromagnetic NDT methods, such as the eddy current and the remote field testing, are common tools for thickness measurement of conductive materials. However, these methods give only localized results where measurements are made, making the process time consuming and inaccurate for assessing the full cross-sectional area of the pipe. Lamb waves have been used previously in the evaluation of steel pipes; however, the existing techniques require prior calibration to a theoretical wave mode, and their accuracy decreases with the length of the pipe evaluated due to wave attenuation effects. Preliminary results show the capability of the MASW test for providing reliable thickness information. The measured dispersion curves include information of fundamental modes and the higher modes, providing an improved characterization of the medium. Thicknesses between 3. 2 mm and 12. 7 mm are tested with an error of less than 2 %. The third study explores the detection of voids in a steel tank filled with lightweight <b>grout.</b> A <b>joint</b> analysis of surface waves and Lamb waves is used for void detection and the identification of debonding conditions in a laboratory scale model of a steel tank filled with grout. Different configurations of the MASW method are conducted using an instrumented hammer (large wavelengths, 10 cm < λ < 25 cm) and a 50 kHz piezoelectric transmitter (small wavelengths, 5 cm < λ < 9 cm) as sources. The attenuation coefficient computed from the Fourier spectra of the measured signals indicates that the presence of a void has an effect on the propagation of the wave. The comparison between experimental and theoretical dispersion curves show that mainly Lamb waves are generated during the testing of the steel tank; thus, detecting the debonding conditions between the steel plate and the grout. Lamb modes are used successfully for detecting the presence of a void beneath the steel wall. The laboratory measurements are effective in the detection of the void, showing amplitudes up to 50 % higher, likely because the deformation of the wall is attenuated by the grout...|$|R
