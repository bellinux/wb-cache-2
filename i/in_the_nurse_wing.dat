40|$|Abstract A {{family is}} a unique and irreplaceable institution. Illness makes a person {{temporarily}} socially unfit and affects not only the sick member but the whole family. <b>The</b> clients <b>in</b> this difficult situation usually look for help and support in their immediate family members and their reactions and advice are of great importance to the clients´ decision-making and behaviour. Experience {{has shown that the}} role of family in care for sick members cannot be replaced by any institution. On the contrary, if the client and the family become active participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical and <b>nursing</b> process <b>the</b> positive stabilization of health condition is much faster and more efficient. Quantitative research through a structured interview based on a scenario prepared in advance was selected for the thesis. The objective of the thesis entitled "Family [...] partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process was to determine the function of families <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process <b>in</b> clients hospitalized in a medical facility and {{to find out if the}} family is motivated by <b>nurses</b> to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process. <b>The</b> last objective was to find out the reasons for families for not being involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process. Three research questions were formulated. The first research question is to determine the function of a family <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process. <b>The</b> second research question is supposed to find out what are <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of a family <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process <b>in</b> clients of individual age categories. The third research question is to determine whether the family is involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process. This topic was chosen because cooperation of nurses and other medical workers with the client´s family is of great importance and is often irreplaceable. Nowadays, cooperation and communication with the client´s family is often neglected for time or personnel reasons. This is a pity, because if the family is correctly involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process its involvement has a positive effect on the patient´s treatment and it represents a great emotional support in this difficult life situation. The research results show that family members are not encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process. <b>The</b> family members do not participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process mainly because of lack of time. But if it is necessary they are willing to engage in any activity that the client´s condition would require. The main difference I find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roles of family <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process <b>in</b> clients of individual age categories is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> need of support and assistance. Clients of pre-school and school age and retired clients need and receive support and assistance in day-to-day activities from their families. Whereas clients of productive age are not ready to accept support and assistance from their families, they prefer to provide it. The research results show that it is necessary to involve family members more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> care for their immediate family member and to actively seek their cooperation...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{describe}} {{and evaluate the}} structures and processes involved in a hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Home programme. Background. Older Australians are the largest consumers of healthcare, {{and as a result}} of the ageing process are at risk of developing hospital acquired iatrogenic complications. Hospital admission avoidance programmes that aim to provide care for patients in their own environment include Hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Home and, more recently, Hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Home. Methods. <b>In</b> 2006, a qualitative evaluation of a nurse-led Hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Home programme using semi-structured interviews with 19 stakeholders was undertaken. Data analysis involved using start codes and content analysis. Findings. Effective referral and communication strategies were important for Hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Home implementation. Furthermore, <b>the</b> Hospital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Home programme manager had acute care and community experience and worked in an advanced practice role. These elements were integral to the programme’s operation. Conclusion. As the population ages, reducing hospital admissions for aged-care facility residents has the potential to improve patient outcomes. A structurally and procedurally sound programme is a key element in achieving this aim...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold: (1) to {{evaluate}} the effect of a specific instructional Intervention, a Nursing Theory Laboratory, on increasing the retention of high risk students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> associate degree <b>nursing</b> program at Miami-Dade Community College in Miami, Florida; and (2) to identify predictors of success of high risk nursing students in this associate degree nursing program. ^ Data were collected from <b>the</b> 195 <b>nursing</b> students enrolled <b>in</b> <b>Nursing</b> Fundamentals during <b>the</b> 1985 - 1987 academic years, and identified as high risk students. Control and experimental groups were selected based on enrollment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory. ^ Results were determined by analyzing several cross-tabulations of selected variables and yielding chi square values, t-tests, and two discriminant analyses. There was no significant relationship between age or ethnic background and enrollment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory. There was no significant relationship between enrollment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory and success in Nursing 1 (Nursing Fundamentals). There was a significant relationship between enrollment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory and success in Nursing 3 (Medical-Surgical Nursing). Writing assessment test scores in two entrance tests and high risk categories, based on the number of enrollments in required science courses, were identified as predictors of success in this program. ^ The conclusion was that <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory does not significantly improve retention of high risk associate degree nursing students if they are enrolled in this intervention at the same time they are enrolled in Nursing Fundamentals. Since those students who were enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory had a significantly higher success rate in Nursing 3, than those students who were not enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory, a recommendation of this study was to offer <b>the</b> <b>Nursing</b> Theory Laboratory to high risk students prior to <b>the</b> beginning of <b>nursing</b> courses. Another recommendation was that students deficient in reading and writing skills should be required to enroll in developmental courses prior to enrollment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> course. ...|$|R
