5|$|The Osiris myth is {{the most}} {{elaborate}} and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns {{the murder of the}} god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the <b>essential</b> <b>character</b> of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.|$|E

In 1884, Rosetti's deputies resigned from parliament, formalizing the split in the party. He sympathized with the socialist movement and was among the main founders of the Radical Party, set up by Rosetti after leaving the PNL. He became party leader after the latter's death in 1885. In 1884, he founded the party newspaper Lupta, remaining editor until 1892 and turning it {{into one of the}} era's most important pro-democracy papers. Additionally, he headed Ziua newspaper in 1896 and wrote Săptămâna magazine by himself from 1901 to 1910, from the politics section to the theater reviews. His contributions also appeared in Liberalul, Epoca, Epoca literară, L’Indépendence Roumaine and Fântâna Blanduziei, earning Panu the reputation of a talented journalist with a gift for logical argumentation and incisive observation. He was a feared polemicist, as exemplified by the 1893 Portrete și tipuri parlamentare.

2500|$|As {{has often}} been the pattern in Manhattan, a {{neighborhood}} that is [...] "discovered" [...] by artists and bohemians and then becomes [...] "hip" [...] will often begin to attract more affluent residents, which drives {{up the price of}} housing, and begins to drive out the residents who [...] "turned over" [...] the neighborhood.

Over the course of time, this demographic shift begins to change the <b>essential</b> <b>character</b> of the neighborhood: it becomes safer, more comfortable, less tolerant of noise, and less [...] "edgy".

2500|$|The Vow of Louis XIII [...] in the Salon of 1824 {{finally brought}} Ingres {{critical}} success.

The 1824 Salon also brought forward a counter-current to the neoclassicism of Ingres: Eugène Delacroix exhibited Les Massacres de Scio, in a romantic style sharply contrasting to that of Ingres.|$|E
2500|$|In this way, Hegel {{intends to}} defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative {{programs}} like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and {{to come up with}} a standard of [...] "duty" [...] (or, in Plato's case, [...] "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to [...] "freedom" [...] and the [...] "ought"), the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept), and Spirit going beyond Nature. And Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the [...] "Quality" [...] chapter of the [...] "Science of Logic." [...] The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because, as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of [...] "reality", what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully [...] "real" [...] (following the Latin etymology of [...] "real:" [...] more [...] "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things don't determine themselves, because, as [...] "finite" [...] things, their <b>essential</b> <b>character</b> is determined by their boundaries, over against other finite things. So, in order to become [...] "real", they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").|$|E
2500|$|Romans {{believed}} {{the genius of}} somebody was an entity that embodied his <b>essential</b> <b>character,</b> personality, and also originally his vital, generative force and raison d' être. However the genius had no direct relationship with sex, at least in classical time conceptions, even though the nuptial bed was named lectus genialis in honour of the Genius and brides {{on the day of}} marriage invoked the genius of their grooms. This seems to hint to a significance of the Genius as the propagative spirit of the gens, of whom every human individual is an incarnation: Censorinus states: [...] "Genius is the god under whose tutelage everyone is born and lives on", and that [...] "many ancient authors, among whom Granius Flaccus in his De Indigitamentis, maintain that he is one and the same with the Lar", meaning the Lar Familiaris. Festus calls him [...] "a god endowed with the power of doing everything", then citing an Aufustius: [...] "Genius is the son of the gods and the parent of men, from whom men receive life. Thence is he named my genius, because he begot me". Festus's quotation goes on saying: [...] "Other think he is the special god of every place", a notion that reflects a different idea. In classic age literature and iconography he is often represented as a snake, that may appear in the conjugal bed, this conception being perhaps the issue of a Greek influence. It was easy for the Roman concept of Genius to expand annexing other similar religious figures as the Lares and the Greek δαίμων αγαθός.|$|E
