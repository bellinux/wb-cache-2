500|$|The {{next week}} on another ride home, a similar {{conversation}} ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will. [...] Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse. [...] After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, {{he told her that}} [...] "he knew of some pills that he would give me and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> them {{at the end of each}} month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant." [...] MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week. [...] In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in Vancouver; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} contest between {{universities}} from different countries, Oxford v Yale at the Queen's Club, West Kensington, in 1894, Fry came {{third in the}} long jump and won the 100yards. In addition to being an outstanding long jumper, sprinter and high jumper, Fry was also a talented hurdler, once competing against Godfrey Shaw the champion hurdler of the time, who beat him but told him, as Fry later recalled: [...] "He was sure <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> up hurdling seriously I might win the championship." [...] Fry was also president of the Oxford University athletics club in 1894.|$|E

Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> one of these over-sexed types who could not act, it would change how the Powell {{character}} is drawn into the affair. Remember the point of the script was that he's just a middle-level insurance investigator. He's tired of his job, spending time in his little office with a drab secretary. So I could have made a different picture, with a prettier girl than Lizabeth Scott, and told the story of that girl, her problems, but that wasn't this movie. That would make it phony, if you cast it with Marilyn Monroe, a type like that. I needed somebody real." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} way it goes sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E

2500|$|The task of {{formally}} investigating {{student and}} alumni complaints fell to L. Hollingsworth Wood, Vice-Chair of Fisk's board of trustees, and chief {{spokesman for the}} trustees. Du Bois criticized Wood in articles in The Crisis, accusing him of ignoring evidence of McKenzie's [...] "incompetency" [...] and suggesting that Wood advised the Greater Fisk Committee [...] "to keep silent." [...] Wood reported, [...] "Our colored friends do not quite realize what they demand of a person in McKenzie's position and {{of his wife and}} children." [...] "I am sure <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the presidency of Fisk and played golf or hunted or danced or dined with the cultured whites of Nashville that but few of my many Negro friends would keep unshaken faith in me, and many would attribute sinister motives to perfectly innocent actions on my part." [...] Wood sympathized with some of the students' demands, noting their irritation over [...] "some rather antiquated regulations as to dress and discipline," [...] and conceding that [...] "President's McKenzie's Scotch nature is a bit unbending." [...] Wood responded to accusations that Fisk was at the mercy of Southern interests, declaring, [...] "that there has been anything even distantly resembling ‘Selling out to the South' is utterly preposterous. Wood praised McKenzie in gaining the good will of the citizens of Nashville, Vanderbilt and Peabody Colleges, but this ‘keeping-the-Negro-in-his-place" [...] cry is utterly unfounded." ...|$|E
