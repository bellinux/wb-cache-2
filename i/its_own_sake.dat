5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa {{is not so much}} about non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fukurozuri (...) is {{a method}} of {{separating}} sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under <b>its</b> <b>own</b> weight. <b>Sake</b> produced this way is sometimes called shizukuzake (...) , meaning [...] "drip sake".|$|R

6000|$|There {{are those}} to whom vanity brings more of pain than of [...] pleasure; there are also those whom it oftener keeps in the [...] background, than thrusts forward.

5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil society values {{education}} highly, for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake</b> {{as well as}} for {{the opportunities}} it provides. The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the upper classes. The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E

His {{experience of}} women was great {{enough for him}} to be aware that the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative; and it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of coyness. That she had already permitted him to make love to her he read as an additional assurance, not fully trowing that in the fields and pastures to [...] "sigh gratis" [...] is by no means deemed waste; love-making being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> sweet <b>sake</b> than in the carking, anxious homes of the ambitious, where a girl's craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end.|$|R

60|$|And Gladys--oh, my Gladys!--Gladys of {{the mystic}} lake, {{now to be}} re-named the Central, for never shall she have {{immortality}} through me. Did I not always see some hard fiber in her nature? Did I not, even {{at the time when}} I was proud to obey her behest, feel that it was surely a poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it? Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul, discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it? Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> noble <b>sake,</b> or was it for the glory which might, without effort or sacrifice, be reflected upon herself? Or are these thoughts the vain wisdom which comes after the event? It was the shock of my life. For a moment it had turned me to a cynic. But already, as I write, a week has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John Roxton and--well, perhaps things might be worse.|$|R
500|$|From a {{different}} point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece [...] "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, [...] "a nondescript parasitic state" [...] that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> for the <b>sake</b> of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an [...] "unhomogeneous little new nation".

60|$|But even {{to victims}} such as these, there are {{pleasant}} resting-places on the thorny way, and flashes of sunlight now and then, {{to make the}} cloudy prospect beautiful, though only for a little while. It is not all misfortune and disappointment {{to the man who}} is mentally unworthy of a great intellectual vocation, so long as he is morally worthy of it; so long as he can pursue it honestly, patiently, and affectionately, for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>sake.</b> Let him work, though ever so obscurely, in this spirit towards his labor, and he shall find the labor itself <b>its</b> <b>own</b> exceeding great reward. In that reward lives the divine consolation, which, though Fame turn her back on him contemptuously, and Affluence pass over unpitying {{to the other side of}} the way, shall still pour oil upon all his wounds, and take him quietly and tenderly to the hard journey's end. To this one exhaustless solace, which the work, no matter of what degree, can yield always to earnest workers, the man who has succeeded, and the man who has failed, can turn alike, as to a common mother--the one, for refuge from mean envy and slanderous hatred, from all the sorest evils which even the thriving child of Fame is heir to; the other, from neglect, from ridicule, from defeat, from all the petty tyrannies which the pining bondman of Obscurity is fated to undergo.|$|R
25|$|Aristotle {{considered}} ethics to be {{a practical}} rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the Nicomachean Ethics.|$|E
25|$|This form of bondage is {{the best}} known in BDSM, and denotes {{restraining}} the passive partner for an ulterior purpose, such as making them more accessible for a spanking session. Bondage for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake</b> is not considered in this category.|$|E

40|$|Roy W. Perrett {{argues that}} the Hindu sage, like the western moral saint, seems precluded from {{pursuing}} non-moral ends for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> If he is precluded from pursuing non-moral ends for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> then he is precluded from pursuing non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> A life devoid of every such pursuit seems deficient. Hence, the Hindu sage seems to forsake the good life. In response, I adapt a reply that Vanessa Carbonell offers {{in the context of}} the moral saint. The Hindu sage might pursue non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> so long as his motivation to pursue moksa is read de re rather than de dicto. Indeed, this reply is more convincing in the case of the Hindu sage than it is in the case of the moral saint...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by Singapore's recent {{effort in}} {{building}} its new skyline in Maria Bay, the thesis intends to employ econometric structural modeling techniques to Singapore's office {{market for the}} period from 1975 to 2011.

With which, the thesis forecasts for the next 10 years, in quarterly interval, the movement trajectory of Singapore's office market.
