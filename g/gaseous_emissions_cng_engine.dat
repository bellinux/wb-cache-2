40|$|Abstract. To reduce <b>emissions,</b> <b>CNG</b> <b>engines</b> are {{commonly}} equipped with three-way catalytic converters. However when the engines run at transient conditions, the {{air fuel ratio}} can not be precisely controlled at theoretical value by traditional means, so the catalytic converters can not achieve their desired effect. This paper presents a new method for <b>CNG</b> <b>engines</b> to control air fuel ratio at transient conditions. The moments which intake and exhaust valves open are used as the trigger signals for ECU to collect the test data simultaneously. The dynamic information of <b>CNG</b> <b>engine</b> is detected by multiple sensors; the nonlinear coupling relationship between air fuel ratio of <b>CNG</b> <b>engine</b> and the operating conditions are established through information fusion and neural network control. The requirement of real time control for air fuel ratio is achieved, so the <b>emissions</b> of <b>CNG</b> <b>engines</b> are reduced further...|$|R

To {{reduce the}} HC <b>emissions</b> of a <b>CNG</b> <b>engine</b> during {{starting}} period, starting experiments {{were carried out}} on a <b>CNG</b> <b>engine.</b> Injection pulse width (IPW) and spark advance angle () were controlled. The results indicate that wider injection pulse width and earlier spark timing cause higher HC emissions. To guarantee a reliable start and low HC emissions, the engine should start with relatively wider injection pulse width and earlier spark timing, and the injection pulse width and spark advance angle should be reduced gradually after the engine speed is steady. 1...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is a gaseous form {{of natural}} gas, {{it have been}} {{recognized}} as one of the promising alternative fuel due to its substantial benefits compared to gasoline and diesel. Natural gas is produced from gas wells or tied in with crude oil production. Approach: Natural gas is promising alternative fuel to meet strict engine emission regulations in many countries.

40|$|Compressed {{natural gas}} (<b>CNG)</b> <b>engines</b> {{are thought to}} be less harmful to the {{environment}} than conventional diesel engines, especially in terms of particle emissions. Although, this is true with respect to particulate matter (PM) emissions, results of particle number (PN) emission comparisons have been inconclusive. In this study, results of on-road and dynamometer studies of buses were used to derive several important conclusions. We show that, although PN <b>emissions</b> from <b>CNG</b> buses are significantly lower than from diesel buses at low engine power, they become comparable at high power. For diesel buses, PN emissions are not significantly different between acceleration and operation at steady maximum power. However, the corresponding PN <b>emissions</b> from <b>CNG</b> buses when accelerating are an order of magnitude greater than when operating at steady maximum power. During acceleration under heavy load, PN <b>emissions</b> from <b>CNG</b> buses are an order of magnitude higher than from diesel buses. The particles emitted from CNG buses are too small to contribute to PM 10 emissions or contribute to a reduction of visibility, and may consist of semivolatile nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dietary {{manipulation}} is {{a common}} practice to mitigate <b>gaseous</b> <b>emission</b> from livestock production facilities, and the variation of fat level in the diet has shown great influence on ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) and enteric methane generation. The changes in dietary fat levels influence rumen chemistry that could modify manure nutrient composition along with odor and <b>gaseous</b> <b>emissions</b> from manure management facilities. Methods A field experiment was carried out on beef cattle feedlots to investigate the effect of four levels of dietary fat concentrations (3 to 5. 5  %) on the manure composition and <b>gaseous</b> <b>emissions</b> (methane-CH 4, nitrous oxide-N 2 O, carbon dioxide-CO 2 and hydrogen sulfide-H 2 S) from the feedlot pen surface. The experiment was carried out over a 5 -month period from June to October during North Dakota’s summer-fall climatic condition. Air and manure sampling was conducted five times at a 20 – 30 day intervals. Results Overall, this research indicated that fat levels in diet have no or {{little effect on the}} nutrient composition of manure and <b>gaseous</b> <b>emission</b> from the pens with cattle fed with different diet. Though significant variation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>emission</b> and manure composition were observed between different sampling periods, no effect of high fat diet was observed on manure composition and <b>gaseous</b> <b>emission.</b> Conclusions It can be concluded that addition of fat to animal diet may not have any impact on <b>gaseous</b> <b>emission</b> and manure compositions...|$|R
