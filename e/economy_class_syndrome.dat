40|$|<b>Economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} {{but still}} {{unavoidable}} complication of long haul flights, particularly in patients who carry various intrinsic risk factors. The tendency to affect even asymptomatic young people and the greater risk to fragment and propagate to the pulmonary circulation are the main characteristics of deep vein thrombosis of long-flight travelers. We report the clinical history of eight patients admitted to intensive care unit for confirmed or highly suspected <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Seven of them developed the syndrome within 72 h from a long return flight, one suffered from pulmonary embolism after a 12 -h car trip. Two out of eight patients died, one because of extremely severe hemodynamic impairment, the other {{as a consequence of}} multiple organ failure caused by a concomitant myocardial infarction. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism represent one of the main medical problems of air travel and cause almost 20 % of deaths in people with no medical history. Although <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurs mostly in elderly, even the healthy young population can be affected and, in fact, three out of eight patients of our series were under 50 years of age. All our patients but one carried a well recognized risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. Clinical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis can sometimes be aspecific and confusing, so that a certain proportion of post-travel deep vein thrombosis, evolving favorably and not giving rise to pulmonary embolism, might effectively remain undiagnosed. <b>Economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome</b> is still quite difficult to deal with and controversial in terms of preventive strategies...|$|E
40|$|In 1998 {{the term}} <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome</b> was coined to {{describe}} the association between travel and thrombosis. A fair risk estimate, however, has not been done. We report {{the results of a}} prospective study, in which we kept the effect of bias to a minimum. We compared travel history in 788 patients with venous thrombosis with that of controls with similar symptoms but in whom the disease had been excluded. For air travel alone, the odds ratio was 1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 3 - 3. 0); also, no association was recorded for other methods of transportation. We have shown that, there is no increased risk of deep vein thrombosis among traveller...|$|E
40|$|A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is {{a common}} finding present in 25 % of the population. A {{relationship}} between PFO and several clinical conditions such as stroke, migraine, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, neurological decompression illness in divers, high altitude pulmonary edema, sleep apnea, and <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome</b> have been documented. Observational non-randomized studies have shown percutaneous PFO closure more effective than medical treatment for stroke prevention, in particular in patients with complete closure {{as well as in}} patients with more than one cerebrovascular event at baseline. In the case of migraine, PFO closure has been shown to result in a marked reduction in migraine burden or migraine days. PFO anatomy, epidemiological data on associated clinical conditions, comparison between percutaneous closure and medical treatment, as well as the technical aspect of the procedure are described in this review...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Survivors of {{poliomyelitis}} sometimes {{travel by}} air with mobility assistance. However, prolonged seating during long-haul flights may also possibly produce stroke events on polio-inflicted patients. A 48 -year-old polio-inflicted male suffered a stroke after an extended flight. A two-dimensional echocardiography was normal without detected patent foramen ovale or dyskinetic segment. The venodynamic variables were all within normal limits. MR Imaging studies revealed acute cerebral infarction {{in the distribution of}} the right middle cerebral artery and posterior watershed area. Hematological examination revealed positive anti-cardiolipin IgG antibody which might contribute to the risk of thrombosis as an underlying condition in addition to immobilization. This is the first presentation of ischemic stroke after a flight in a patient with prior poliomyelitis. In addition to decompression sickness, <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> stroke <b>syndrome</b> and postpoliomyelitis syndrome, the physician should also take other coagulation disorders into consideration during the investigation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} case of acute {{mesenteric}} venous thrombosis after a long distance flight in a traveller presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting within 48 h of prolonged immobility situation. Venous thrombosis in the lower limbs and venous thromboembolism has been clearly associated with prolonged air travel (<b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Thrombosis was diagnosed by computed tomography of the abdomen, and after starting anticoagulant therapy with acenocumarol, symptoms yielded completely in a few weeks. The study of thrombophilia was negative, although the existence of two first-degree relatives (mother and grandmother) {{with a history of}} venous thrombosis with a history of venous thrombosis makes it likely a situation of inherited thrombophilia. Although exceptional, mesenteric venous thrombosis should be considered in travellers with acute abdominal pain after prolonged air travel when there are thrombophilic conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. Venous {{thromboembolism}} {{associated with}} travelling, or <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is increasingly recognised as {{a sequence of}} long haul flights and so paradoxical cerebral embolism through a patent foramen ovale. Materials and methods. We present a new case of economy class stroke syndrome and {{review of the literature}} using MEDLINE search. Results. Literature review identified 12 additional cases. In most of them, stroke occurred in close approximation with landing of the aircraft following a long-haul flight. Venous thromboembolism was present in 58 %, while a patent foramen ovale was diagnosed with contrast echocardiography in all but one case. Our case presented with severe left hemispheric stroke, and significant delay, two days after a long-haul flight. Conclusions. The small number of reported cases indicates either the rarity of this entity or unawareness of its existence. The true incidence of this condition remains unknown. However, because of treatment implications such as the need to treat venous thromboembolism or close the patent foramen ovale, clinicians should be aware of this entity...|$|E
40|$|Traveling long {{distances}} {{can be very}} stressful on the body. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has often been linked to long air flights or long distance travel in a vehicle. DVT is a blood clot usually formed in the legs. <b>Economy</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (ECS) {{has been referred to}} as the formation of a DVT occurring during (or just after) a long airplane flight, especially in economy class where there is the least space allotted per passenger and one’s legs especially tend to be immobilized for lack of leg room (MedicineNet, 2012). Developing a DVT can lead to other life-threatening illnesses such as venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction. There are many destinations in the world that require many hours of travel. The flights required to get there could account for eight or more hours in an airplane. Prolonged travel with inactivity of greater than 3 hours can lead to DVT formation (Codina-Leik, 2014). It is not uncommon in one’s medical career to cross path’s with a patient who has developed a DVT during long distance travel. It is important for an advanced practitioner along with colleagues to identify patients who may have an increased risk for DVT especially those who may embark on long distance travel or who are experiencing symptoms after travel...|$|E

40|$|It {{has taken}} {{a long time to}} plan for this November issue in Internal Medicine. The topic is so wide and often {{neglected}} as the specialties take prominence. However, we do recognize a need for the general physician and this issue of the Annals highlights recent advances in some fields of internal medicine. We hope it would serve to generate interest in Internal Medicine and, at the same time, serve as a quick update for most of us. Much has been said about the <b>economy</b> <b>class</b> <b>syndrome,</b> deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and sudden death. Though this was thought to have been not significant in Asia, research and ongoing studies are proving otherwise. The article by Gallus et al 1 reviews the pathways to coagulation, the incidence of DVTs and new drugs for treatment. With increasing prevalence of obesity in Singapore, obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is increasingly well recognized. The article from Douglas 2 serves to emphasize this problem. He notes that patients with undiagnosed OSAHS are heavy users of healthcare, are predisposed towards hypertension and road traffic accidents. It is enlightening to note that continuous positive airway pressure therapy goes a long way in treating this condition. The paper by Fong, 3 on the use of immunology in the treatment of various conditions from diabetes mellitus to the usual array of autoimmune conditions, is an eye opener. Unfortunately, there will still be problems with side effects and we can expect more to come with more ongoing trials. There are two papers on the use of computers in medicine. 4, 5 This will be an important part of our work and will serv...|$|E
