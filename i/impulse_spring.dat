60|$|At last he was {{speaking}} in good earnest: he laid {{a strong emphasis on}} his closing words. I laid a stronger emphasis on them still by suddenly leaving my chair. The <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> to my feet was irresistible. Major Fitz-David had started a new idea in my mind.|$|R
6000|$|But nobody heard: nobody opened. There was one {{who stood}} without word or cry, {{close to the}} door--her eyes dilated, her cheek colourless, her whole person, soul and body alike, {{concentrated}} in that one <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> forward the first moment the bolt should be drawn. But still the door remained fast shut! ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{before he}} could let it go, the two other men, moved as if by a single <b>impulse,</b> had <b>sprung</b> forward with a bound, and in the self-same tone and in the self-same words cried out with one accord, in a wildly excited voice, [...] "For God's sake, don't throw! You don't know how {{dangerous}} it is!" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{that notion}} {{did not last}} long. Powell, after {{repressing}} his first <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> for the companion and hammer at the captain's door, took steps to have himself relieved by the boatswain. He {{was in a state}} of distraction as to his feelings and yet lucid as to his mind. He remained on the skylight so as to keep his eye on the tray.|$|R
60|$|As if to put {{the matter}} beyond doubt, Olaf, with Snorro on his back, issued at that moment from the woods on the {{opposite}} side of the river, and went out upon the identical spit of sand where, on the previous evening, he had held such bitter communings with his own spirit. The Norseman leaders recognised the children at once, being almost within hail of them, and it was with difficulty they restrained the <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> to their feet and shout.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mr Clearemout, {{believing that the}} whole of his {{conversation}} had been overheard, supposed that he had discovered all his villainy to one who was thoroughly able, as well as willing, to thwart him. For a moment he felt an almost irresistible <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> on and slay his enemy; his face became dark with suppressed emotion; and {{it is quite possible}} that in the fury of his disappointed malice he might have attempted violence,--had not Oliver spoken. His voice was husky as he said,--"Chance, sir--unfortunate, miserable chance--led me to overhear the last few words that passed between you and--" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the next}} instant she quickly {{transferred}} her hold to a cleft in the cliff, and was safe. Not so her companion. The soil beneath him, loosened by the <b>impulse</b> of his <b>spring,</b> slipped away: he was falling with it, when she caught him sharply with her disengaged hand, and together they scrambled to a more secure footing.|$|R

Meanwhile, {{they had come to}} the end of the path, and while Elizabeth {{straightened}} some flowers, and made them stand upright within their fence of string, Mary looked at her father, who was pacing up and down, with his hand behind his back and his head bowed in meditation.

She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige of the now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in the Quakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening. Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in the tone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,-- ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{time the}} rising of the sun afforded some relief, but as it gained in power the {{position}} of the fugitives became almost unbearable. The stoppages were frequent, and at all the stations the Boers from the neighbourhood had assembled, some from curiosity, but the majority to wait for the trains that were to take them to the front. Although sometimes detained for three or four hours, the passengers were not allowed to alight. The men, indeed, at times, by common <b>impulse,</b> <b>sprang</b> out, but were soon forced to take their places again, some of the Boers using their heavy whips over their heads and shoulders, while others with pointed guns prevented any attempt at retaliation. Men, and even women, crowded the platform, jeering and cursing those in the waggons, menacing them with their whips and snatching at such trinkets, and even cloaks as took their fancy. The men were all several times searched for weapons, and made to turn their pockets inside out, the contents being unceremoniously transferred to those of the Boers. Chris and his companions would have taken their places below with their friends, but these implored them not to do so, being afraid that they would be enraged beyond endurance, and might in their anger say or do something that would give an excuse to the Boers to use their rifles, which they so often pointed threateningly at women as well as men. It was only when the train was in motion that food and drink were passed up from below, as these too would assuredly, had they been seen, have been confiscated by the brutal tormentors.|$|R

60|$|As this brutal talk {{fell upon}} his ears Mr. Dove's reason {{departed}} from him entirely. After all, {{he was an}} English gentleman first, and a clergyman afterwards; also he loved his daughter, and to hear her spoken of like this was intolerable to him, {{as it would have}} been to any father. Lifting the sjambok he cut Ishmael across the mouth so sharply that the blood came from his lips, then suddenly remembering that this deed would probably mean his death, stood still awaiting the issue. As it chanced it did not, for the man, like most brutes and bullies, was a coward, as Rachel had already found out. Obeying his first <b>impulse</b> he <b>sprang</b> at the clergyman with an oath, then seeing that his two guides, who carried assegais, had ranged themselves beside him, checked himself, for he feared lest those spears should pierce his heart.|$|R

60|$|She {{had found}} him--had she but known it--a dejected, miserable {{man in the}} act of {{reckoning}} up all that he had lost. In betraying Susan he had acted upon an <b>impulse</b> that <b>sprang</b> partly from rage, and partly from a sense of religious duty. In counting later the cost to himself, he cursed the folly of his rage, and began to wonder if such strict observance of religious duty was really worth while to a man who had his way to make in the world. In short, he was in the throes of reaction. But now, in her unsuspicion, he found his hopes revive. She need never know. The Holy Office preserved inviolate secrecy on the score of deletions--since to do otherwise might be to discourage delators--and there were no confrontations of accuser and accused, such as took place in temporal courts. Don Rodrigo left the Calle de Ataud better pleased with the world than he had been since morning.|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} a hairy brown hand had {{appeared}} and clutched the balcony railings, {{and in another}} {{the face of the}} Malay was peering through these at the man on the couch. His expression was an unpleasant grin, by reason of the krees he held between his teeth, and he was bleeding from an ugly wound in his cheek. His hair wet to drying stuck out like horns from his head. His body was bare save for the wet trousers that clung to him. Bailey's first <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> from the couch, but his legs reminded him that this was impossible.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} past noon, when a step {{came up the}} staircase. It had passed beyond the limits where there was {{communication}} with the lower regions of the palace, and was mounting the successive flights which led only to Hilda's precincts. Faint as the tread was, she heard and recognized it. It startled her into sudden life. Her first <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> {{to the door of}} the studio, and fasten it with lock and bolt. But a second thought made her feel that this would be an unworthy cowardice, on her own part, and also that Miriam--only yesterday her closest friend had a right to be told, face to face, that thenceforth they must be forever strangers.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly there arose a great cry. One of the lassos had snapt and the {{alligator}} was floundering {{back into the}} water, when Sambo rushed in up to the arm-pits, and caught {{the end of the}} rope. At the same moment two alligators made at the Negro with open jaws. It is probable that the animals went in his direction by mere accident, and would have brushed past him in blind haste; but to Martin and Barney {{it seemed as if the}} poor man's fate were sealed, and they uttered a loud shout of horror as they bounded simultaneously into the water, not knowing what to do, but being unable to restrain the <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> to Sambo's aid. Fortunately, however, one of the other Negroes was near Sambo. He sprang forward, and dealt {{the alligator}}s two tremendous blows with his pole on their snouts, right and left, which turned them off. Then other Negroes came up, laid hold of Sambo, who would not let go his hold and was being dragged into deep water, caught the end of the rope, and in ten minutes hauled their victim to the shore, when it was quickly despatched in the usual manner.|$|R
40|$|When Latin writing {{finally reached}} Scandinavia {{sometime}} in the 11 th century, it was met by a strong and well established runic writing tradition which had been in permanent use as a functional writing system for over 800 years. Latin script culture came {{in the wake of}} Christianity and church organisation, and the Latin alphabet was by this point of time already deeply rooted in social, political, and religious institutions. Runic writing, on the other hand, was not linked to such powerful religious and/or political institutions but served a pragmatic everyday purpose. Still, the native script culture was not immediately superseded by the newly arrived script system. Instead, there evolved a vibrant two-script culture which lasted for a period of at least 300 years. It was characterised by the peaceful coexistence of runic and Latin writing. Moreover, runic tradition not only survived by the side of Latin script culture. It rather appears to have experienced an enormous upswing after the introduction of Latin writing. This development proved to be unique in the European context. – The present thesis pursues a systematic and cultural-historical approach in order to explore the nature of the coexistence of these two script cultures. The intention is to adopt a slightly different perspective than in previous research. Thus, the objective is not to reconfirm the influence which Latin script culture undeniably exerted on runic writing and repeat the diachronic ‘success story’ of Latin writing. On the contrary, the focus lies on a synchronic perspective and an analysis of how runic tradition took advantage of the presence of the Latin script system. Thus, this thesis seeks to demonstrate that runic writing neither passively yielded to nor slavishly copied from the new script culture. Rather, runic tradition responded to and sovereignly dealt with the <b>impulses</b> <b>springing</b> from Latin writing. It maintained its characteristic features and independent status in the comparatively long period of coexistence. Rune-carvers took up particular elements and exploited them for their own benefit and, what is even more important, {{on the basis of the}} runic tradition’s own premises, i. e. on the basis of its heritage from the older and Viking runic tradition. – The underlying structure of this thesis follows the observation that the contact between these two script cultures occurred and found expression on three different levels of runic writing: the writing system itself, orthographical and other writing standards, and – last but not least – writing materials and subject matter. In order to facilitate comparison, each of these sections is preceded by an overview of the state affairs concerning the aspect in question in the older and Viking runic tradition and ends with a preliminary conclusion. In addition, the thesis discusses some reflections on conceptual changes in the perception of writing among rune-carvers after the introduction of Latin writing...|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of recoil buffer is {{made from}} a resilient and deformable material (leather, rubber, polymer e.g. a rubber butt pad on a shotgun). A second way of producing a recoil buffer is to insert a spring into the recoil train—the path/part(s) generating recoil <b>impulse.</b> This <b>spring</b> is mounted to the point(s) where the firearm contacts a mechanical holder such as a tripod or human upper torso. Reducing the initial jolt, the rate and/or extent of rearward displacement, and any internal impacts in the operating parts of a firearm can reduce the shooter's perception of recoil, and may also work to {{extend the life of}} the mechanism and its parts. More sophisticated designs use hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorbers; systems of springs, cams and levers to modify, dampen, or dissipate the rearward impulse generated as the projectile is fired down the bore of the firearm. Aftermarket buffers are often moulded bumpers or additional springs placed between operating metal parts which impact one another, such as the slide and the frame of a semi-automatic pistol. This type of buffer cushions the battering force of repeated metal on metal impact, reducing wear on parts and lengthening the service life of the firearm. Reduction of perceived recoil discomfort is an immediate added benefit of this type recoil buffer.|$|R
60|$|I wish {{to direct}} the reader's {{attention}} to a certain quality in the movements of children when young, which is somehow lovable in them, although it would be even unpleasant in any grown person. Their movements are not graceful, but they fall short of grace by something so sweetly humorous that we only admire them the more. The imperfection is so pretty and pathetic, and it gives so great a promise of something different in the future, that it attracts us more than many forms of beauty. They have something of the merit of a rough sketch by a master, in which we pardon what is wanting or excessive {{for the sake of}} the very bluntness and directness of the thing. It gives us pleasure to see the beginning of gracious <b>impulses</b> and the <b>springs</b> of harmonious movement laid bare to us with innocent simplicity.|$|R
60|$|My <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> to my {{feet and}} to rush through them all and out by the open door. But how would that help Lucia? Suppose that I got clear away, she would be in their hands until I could come back with help, for single-handed I could not hope to clear a way for her. All this flashed through my mind in an instant, and I saw that the only course for me was to lie still, take what came, and wait my chance. The fellow's coarse hand felt about among my curls--those curls in which only a woman's fingers had ever wandered. The next instant he gripped my ear and a pain shot through me as if I had been touched with a hot iron. I bit my lip to stifle a cry, and I felt the blood run warm down my neck and back.|$|R
2500|$|The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, {{with the}} Fifth Phase Offensive, {{also known as}} the Chinese Spring Offensive, with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).

60|$|But after a {{time the}} course of the Sparhawk or {{the course of the}} message changed. I drifted to the north. Little by little my course {{deviated}} from the line on which I might have met the message. At last I saw that I should never meet it. When I became convinced of this, my first <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> overboard and swim for it. But I restrained this impulse, as I had restrained others like it. If Bertha came back, I must be ready to meet her. I must run no risks, for her sake and my sake. She must find me on the Sparhawk if she should come back. She had left me and she had come back; she might come back again. Even to get her message I must not run the risk of missing her. And so with yearning heart and perhaps tearful eyes I watched the little craft disappear and become another derelict.|$|R
60|$|Of course, when I {{thoroughly}} {{understood the}} state of the case, my first <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> out of bed, and, as quickly as possible, {{to get out of that}} thumping and sliding house. But I restrained myself. The floor might be covered with broken glass, I might not be able to find my clothes in the darkness and in the jumble of furniture at the end of the room, and even if I could dress myself, it would be folly to jump out in the midst of that raging storm into a probable mass of wreckage which I could not see. It would be far better to remain dry and warm under my roof. There was no reason whatever to suppose that the house would go to pieces, or that it would turn over. It must stop some time or other, and, until it did so, I would be safer in my bed than anywhere else. Therefore in my bed I stayed.|$|R

60|$|From {{that time}} {{it seemed to be}} tacitly agreed to let bygones be bygones; and I could see that as the {{dangerous}} feeling that had threatened my life diminished, the old pleasure they had once found in my company returned. But my feelings towards them did not change, nor could they while that black and terrible suspicion concerning Rima was in my heart. I talked again freely with them, as if there had been no break in the old friendly relations. If they watched me furtively whenever I went out of doors, I affected not to see it. I set to work to repair my rude guitar, which had been broken in my absence, and studied to show them a cheerful countenance. But when alone, or in my hammock, hidden from their eyes, free to look into my own heart, then I was conscious that something new and strange had come into my life; that a new nature, black and implacable, had taken the place of the old. And sometimes it was hard to conceal this fury that burnt in me; sometimes I felt an <b>impulse</b> to <b>spring</b> like a tiger on one of the Indians, to hold him fast by the throat until the secret I wished to learn was forced from his lips, then to dash his brains out against the stone. But they were many, and there was no choice but to be cautious and patient if I wished to outwit them with a cunning superior to their own.|$|R

Those great hands seized him for a second by the dainty white throat, and flung him back in anger. Montague Nevitt fell heavily on a thick mass of bracken. There was a gurgle, a gasp; then his head lolled senseless. He was very much hurt. That at least was certain. The {{barrister}} stood over him for a minute, still purple in the face. Montague Nevitt was white--very white and death-like. All at once it occurred to the big strong man that his hands--those great hands--were very fierce and powerful. He had clutched Nevitt by the throat, half unconsciously, with all his might, just {{to give him a}} purchase as he flung the man from him. He looked at him again. Great heavens--what was this? It burst over him at once. He awoke to it with a wild start. The fellow was dead! And this was clearly manslaughter! ...|$|R
60|$|Sparrer's first <b>impulse</b> was to <b>spring</b> the trap, but {{on second}} thought he decided to leave it alone. It might well be that his {{discovery}} were better unknown. His life in New York streets had taught him {{that it is possible}} to know too much; that some things are better forgotten as soon as learned. He recalled what had been said about the illegality of trapping beaver. If Pat and Alec were doing a little quiet poaching it was none of his business. They would not thank him for interfering. Of course the trap must be theirs. There was no one else trapping in the Hollow. The poachers there had been so much talk about were working miles beyond the Hollow, on the long line. He remembered now that neither Pat nor Alec had once suggested a trip up this way. Good reason. They wanted to avoid any embarrassing questions about those queer little mounds, for he knew now that each one covered a trap-pan. The boughs and the snow were to keep the holes from freezing over. He counted the mounds. There were three at one house and four at the other.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, Lady Trevlyn {{drew her}} wrapper {{about her and}} paced softly down the long hall lighted only by fitful gleams of {{moonlight}} and the ruddy glow of the fire. At the far end was the state chamber, never used now, and never visited except by Hester, who occasionally went in to dust and air it, and my lady, who always passed the anniversary of Sir Richard's death alone there. The gallery was very dark, and she seldom went farther than the last window in her restless walks, but as she now approached she was startled to see a streak of yellow light under the door. She kept the key herself and neither she nor Hester had been there that day. A cold shiver passed over her for, as she looked, {{the shadow of a}} foot darkened the light for a moment and vanished as if someone had noiselessly passed. Obeying a sudden <b>impulse,</b> my lady <b>sprang</b> forward and tried to open the door. It was locked, but as her hand turned the silver knob a sound as if a drawer softly closed met her ear. She stooped to the keyhole but it was dark, a key evidently being in the lock. She drew back and flew to her room, snatched the key from her dressing table, and, bidding Hester follow, returned to the hall.|$|R
