40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{consumer}} protection under the law of contract and the law of torts. The first part of the article contains basic informations on the consumer movement in the United Kingdom (consumer organizations, the government and the consumer, protective legislation outside the private law). The changes in the attitude towards the consumer are reflected both in legislation and case law. So far as the law of sale is concerned, the traditional common law rule was that there was no legal obligation on the vendor to inform the buyer that he was under a mistake not induced by the act of the seller. The first statutory act that limited the ill consequences of this harsh rule was introduced in 1893. By the Sale of Goods Act a condition is implied that the goods will be reasonably fit for the customers purpose, if the buyer makes known to the seller the purpose for which he requires the goods, so as to show that he relies on the seller's choice, and the goods are of a description which the seller ordinarily supplies. As a rule the consumer's rights against the seller do not extend beyond a cash compensation. There {{is no doubt that the}} right for rescission is primarily a consumer's remedy and its limitation by the Sale of Goods Act has evoked sharp criticism among legal writers. Another important statute, the acts governing hire purchase agreements lay down conditions limiting some of ill efects of modern marketing and advertising on the consumer's choice. The most important of these provisions are: the agreement must be in writing; if the contract is made at buyers home he has three days within which he can withdraw; advertisements relating to <b>goods</b> <b>on</b> <b>hire</b> purchase must show full details of the terms, if one or more important figure is shown (such as deposit). One of the latest examples of the evolution on the field of the law of contract is the Misrepresentation Act of 1967. Its main purpose is to give an effective remedy to the person who was induced to contract by some misleading statement. It must be emphasized that the Act has introduced several proposals made by the Commitee on Consumer Protection. The protective legislation has resulted in a widespread use of various forms of exemption clauses by mass producing and marketing enterprisers. These disclaimers of liability usually appear in the printed clauses of standard forms, so called guarantees, on labels attached to goods, etc. In order to protect the consumer the case law seem to recognize the need for developing a number of restrictive rules of construction peculiar to exemption clauses. In earlier times the producer of the manufacture usually sold it to the consumer. Thus the latter, being in privity of contract with the maker, was entitled to sue the producer for losses caused by the defects of the product. The new forms of distribution of goods has changed the legal position of the buyer who is no longer in privity with the producer. Hence courts and legislators are confronted {{with the problem of}} finding a satisfactory solution of protecting the legitimate interests of the injured ultimate consumer in cases where he is unable to get recovery from the retailer. Before 1932 it was rather doubtful whether there was any liability on the part of the producer to the ultimate consumer of his product with whom there was no contractual link. But in that year the decision of the House of Lords in the most celebrated case Donoghue v. Stevenson established that the manufacturer of products owes a duty of care to the ultimate consumer or user. The principle has been gradually extended to include repairers, assemblers and builders.

5|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was {{the rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather <b>goods.</b> Initially relying <b>on</b> <b>hired</b> ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether, as competition for readers and viewers increases among news producers, media organizations are focusing <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> individuals whose talents most reflect the specific communication strengths {{and style of}} a particular medium, or whether news executives still seek more traditional journalistic skills in applicants. The study also examined differences {{in the types of}} application materials news executives require applicants to submit, and compared those responses to what recently hired employees reported being asked to submit by their employers. The study used data from three national surveys conducted in the Spring of 1996. The first was the Jane Pauley Task Force national survey of television news directors. The second was a national survey of daily newspaper editors, and the third was a national survey of recent graduates of four-year journalism and mass communication programs. The study found that news executives appear more likely to use traditional journalistic skills when describing an ideal applicant. However, even more important than such skills for both media types were the personality characteristics of new employees. Thus, news executives appear to place more importance <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>good</b> employees than <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>good</b> journalists. The results of the study also have important methodological implications for future research in the area. News directors and news editors were found to describe the language capabilities they seek in applicants very differently, which may b...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{disability}} discrimination laws <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of older workers. These laws do not specifically define older disabled workers as a protected class. But the incidence of disabilities rises steeply with age, so older workers may be disproportionately affected by disability discrimination laws. Moreover, the perception that a worker is likely to have a disability in the near future should also rise steeply with age, and that perception may affect older workers adversely. We estimate {{the effects of}} disability discrimination laws <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of disabled workers, focusing some attention <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of nondisabled older workers. We use state variation in disability discrimination protections, which can strengthen the coverage of these laws by using a broader definition of disability than the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or applying to smaller firms, or can entail higher costs via larger damages...|$|R
