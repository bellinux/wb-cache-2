25|$|The Blackhand Edition uses {{both the}} Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> knees, the player can pull the {{controllers}} upwards to lift {{them off the}} ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers {{from side to side}} swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to Wii Sports Boxing - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to throw in the game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{is usually}} {{played on a}} grass field {{approximately}} [...] by [...] At {{each end of the}} field are the goal posts and an in-goal area. Games last for eighty minutes and are divided into forty-minute halves. Each team defends one end and attempts to score points through tries and goals. One team kicks the ball towards the opposition starting play. At half time they swap ends, with the other team kicking off. After a successful kick-off the ball is in general play and can be passed, kicked, caught, picked up or grounded by any player. The ball can be kicked in any direction, but must be passed backwards. Players attempt to stop the opposition running the ball by touching them. Rucks form when at least one player from each team <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> feet and the ball is on the ground. Mauls are formed when the ball carrier is held by {{at least one of the}} opposition and a teammate is also bound to them.

Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site—Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012.
