40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the Kobler and the Kuhne & Heitz rulings on Italian system of administrative justice.

The purpose of the contribution is to evaluate whether, in the Italian legal system, these rulings could potentially bring any changes in the current rules or have contributed to trigger a process of change, or whether the relevant national provisions already provide a sufficient standard of protection for individuals' rights. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} is to demonstrate the legal viability of assuring, to the defendant charged with smuggling, the same rights that are already available to the defendant charged with tax evasion in general. This effort takes in special account, here. the requirement of previous judgement of the administrative matters and the possibilíty of extinction of the punshability by repairing the damage. Contrary literature generally indicates as the main obstacle the absence of legal basis - what allows its classifícation as posilivist. The globalized reality of today recommends {{the study of the}} problem by an interdisciplinary approach. attentive to tributary and customs legal details, which implies the coherent understanding of the system, the respect to the possibility of judicial review and the overcome of this formalistic impediment. In this context, it is convenient to review specific criminal principies and to adopt them as safe criteria to contain and to reduce the administrativization of the criminal law based on tax, phenomenon that, in fact, is the very reason for the criminalization of tax evasion. Still, because it translates greater guarantee to the defendant, it is recommended the understanding of the previous end of the fiscal proceedings not as a punshability condition, but as a condition of action, in the modalities of apparení criminality and fair cause', for the same reason, not only the tax payment, but also the compensation for damage - ampler hypothesis, that contemplates the tax payment and the application of the forfeiture and the fine penalties - should be seen as motives for the exlinction of the punshability for smuggling. This theoretic adjustment is also justified because of the legal uncertainty that surrounds the entire academic production referring to the objective conditions of punshability. The research of the general characteristics of ali tributary crimes, allied {{to the study of the}} histórica! background of smuggling and tax evasion prosecution in Brazil, indicates that there are no theoretical or practical impediments to the equation proposed here, while the contrary positions present themselves as untenable. As this is a customs tax crime, it is indispensable a brief incursion into the rules of the administrative proceedings that corresponds to Treasury loss and underpricing hypothesis, both factual aspects that any smuggling charge must. necessarily, describe with minimally acceptable evidence. which may only be represented (or not) by the <b>final</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> If the sanction imposed administratively for the customs crime is satisfied - regardless of whether it is the constitution of a credit, the penalty of forfeiture, or the fine - the tax loss will be repaired and, automatically, the punshability of the smuggling crime will be extinct...|$|E

40|$|The problem {{statement}} {{addressed in this}} study is as follows: to what extent does EU law compel a Dutch stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law? The {{problem statement}} presumes that Dutch law has a system in place with respect to the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement. In this study it is made clear {{that there is no such}} system. As a rule, revoking a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement leads to contentment as well as resistance. To overcome the resistance and thereby to create consensus as to contentment, there must be systematic rules governing the revocation. Based on dogmatics, a system can be created, avoiding a situation in which there are only intuitive judgments which, because they lack structure, cannot lead to the certainty and predictability of the law. In that regard this study provids points to consider in the General Administrative Law Act about the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> In view of the principle of national procedural autonomy, the starting point is that, in the absence of EU rules on this subject, EU law does not compel a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law. There are circumstances, however, in which EU law recognises such an obligation. An EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable judgement. The European Court of Justice seems to have recognised that from the characterization of administration versus justice it follows that the administrative body’s freedom to revoke its stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is greater than the court’s freedom to revoke its stable judgement. The the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> unfavourably is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably. An explanation for this difference can be found in the fact that the EU law duty to recover – which can mean under Dutch law that a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is revoked unfavourably – is not so much about the interests of an individual (as is the case with the EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably), but rather about the general interests of the European Union itself, such as (in the case of EU (agricultural) aid) the justified allocation of financial resources and (in the case of state aid) the prevention of a distortion of competition...|$|R
