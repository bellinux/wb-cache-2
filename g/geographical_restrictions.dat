2500|$|The {{geographical}} limitations can {{be quite}} strict. [...] "Newcastle Brown Ale" [...] was restricted to being brewed {{in the city of}} Newcastle upon Tyne in England. However, having obtained this protection for their product, the brewery decided in 2004 that it would move across the river Tyne to Gateshead. As Gateshead is technically a separate town—albeit only the width of a river apart—it does not fall within the required <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction.</b> The brewery then applied to the European Union authorities to have the <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction</b> revoked. If the restriction had not been revoked, the brewery would have been forced either to move back to Newcastle, or stop calling its beer [...] "Newcastle" [...] brown ale. Ultimately, the brewery's application to revoke the geographic restriction was approved. Similarly, Stilton cheese can only be produced in the three English counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. Stilton village is in the traditional county of Huntingdonshire, now a district of Cambridgeshire, so Stilton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton (although it is unclear whether the cheese was ever produced there. Quenby Hall in Leicestershire claims to be the first producer).|$|R

40|$|After the Bank Charter Act in 1833, English banks could branch nationally without {{legal or}} <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction.</b> It has been {{previously}} thought that despite this freedom, early English joint-stock banks predominantly began as single units. Drawing upon a new dataset, this article maps the growth of branch banking, the size of bank networks and their geographical location and spread. It demonstrates that banks pursued branching strategies against the intentions of regulators and were successful in forming large and complex networks. However, ultimately, the majority settled for local, district and multi-regional structures, as opposed to national structures...|$|R

30|$|The {{internet}} introduces huge social inequalities {{due to its}} functionalist downside. The {{distribution of}} users is polarised due to economic and social status and inadequate economic structures {{in many parts of}} the world (Conachy 1999). The 2015 United Nations Economic and Social Council report links this inequality to the lack of open source models like the open source software production which are based on a commitment to share and open participation to online community users without any enforced <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction</b> that serves a particular region. Looker and Thiessen (2003) are of the opinion that geographical location has an impact on patterns of use and attitudes to new technologies. The authors argue that internet inequality will be a persistent phenomenon that is likely to “affect the ways and the extent to which members of different subgroups involve themselves in the information society” (Looker and Thiessen 2003 : 487).|$|R
40|$|Many {{third-party}} logistics (3 PL) providers in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region are small to medium companies, which {{play an important}} role in outbound logistics, managing logistics activities in the manufacturing supply chain in the Greater China. It is necessary for these companies to improve information transparency to their supply chain partners to maintain competitiveness. In this paper, a logistics information management platform known as Integrated Logistics Information Management System (ILIMS) is presented to suit this need. ILIMS aims to provide 3 PL companies a uniform way of doing business with other trading partners and managing operation performance online. Besides, it enables 3 PL companies to communicate with different trading partners on the internet without <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction.</b> A case study is presented with the application of ILIMS to a medium-sized 3 PL company.

50|$|As a quirk of analog broadcasting, some FM radio {{receivers}} that could tune {{as low as}} 87.5 MHz received the audio signal from NTV within the broadcast area of the main St. John's transmitter, {{as a consequence of}} channel 6's audio carrier being on 87.75 MHz. This ended when the station converted to digital. This fact was regularly noted in print ads in the Newfoundland Herald, although these ads did not suggest any <b>geographical</b> <b>restrictions.</b>|$|E
40|$|Geographic {{information}} retrieval (GIR) systems allow users to specify a geographic context, {{in addition to}} a more traditional query, enabling the system to pinpoint interesting search results whose relevancy is location-dependent. In particular local search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, which satisfy a <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction.</b> Unfortunately, many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems, including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located. As the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available, automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions. In this paper, we propose such a technique, using fuzzy footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries, and we provide experimental results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local search setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} ofSalmonella entericaserovar Typhi (S.

Here we utilize data from whole-genome sequences (WGS) of nearly 2, 000 isolates sourced from over 60 countries {{to generate a}} robust genotyping scheme that is phylogenetically informative and compatible {{with a range of}} assays. These data show that, {{with the exception of the}} rapidly disseminating H 58 subclade (now designated genotype 4. 3. 1), the global S.

Typhi populations and help identify recent introductions of S. Typhi into new or previously endemic locations, providing information on their likely geographical source. This approach can be used to classify clinical isolates and provides a universal framework for further experimental investigations...|$|R
40|$|Third Party Logistics (3 PL) {{service is}} one of the core {{logistics}} services in the local logistics industry nowadays. However, the business operation among the small and medium-sized 3 PL facilitators and their trading partners is still manual-based which is inefficient. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop new approach for them. In this paper, a comprehensive logistics information management platform called Integrated Logistics Information Management System (ILIMS) is proposed to suit this need. It aims to integrate the internal and external logistics 2 ̆ 7 operations and the information flow of 3 PL facilitators providing them a systematic mean of doing business. Moreover, it provides an effective channel for them to communicate with different trading partners without <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction</b> at low operating cost.

40|$|Mycobacterium africanum is {{a member}} of the Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) and an important cause of human tuberculosis in West Africa that is rarely observed elsewhere. Here we genotyped 613 MTBC clinical isolates from Ghana, and searched for associations between the different phylogenetic lineages of MTBC and patient variables. We found that 17. 1 % (105 / 613) of the MTBC isolates belonged to M. africanum, with the remaining belonging to M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. No M. bovis was identified in this sample. M. africanum was significantly more common in tuberculosis patients belonging to the Ewe ethnic group (adjusted odds ratio: 3. 02; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 67 - 5. 47, p< 0. 001). Stratifying our analysis by the two phylogenetic lineages of M. africanum (i. e. MTBC Lineages 5 and 6) revealed that this association was mainly driven by Lineage 5 (also known as M. africanum West Africa 1). Our findings suggest interactions between the genetic diversity of MTBC and human diversity, and offer a possible explanation for the <b>geographical</b> <b>restriction</b> of M. africanum to parts of West Africa...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{tools and}} fully {{integrated}} systems {{are currently being}} applied to educational settings, delivering educational content and activities to students. Asynchronous, computer-mediated communications enable students to reflect upon what they are learning, share their thoughts, and read those of others.
