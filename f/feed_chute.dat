50|$|The GAU-18/A, is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right hand feed depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> adapter {{is attached to the}} left or right hand feed pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.|$|E
50|$|The submachine gun {{could be}} fed from {{standard}} box magazines, {{or from a}} large drum magazine which was not actually connected to the weapon and instead fed the cartridges through a flexible chute.

50|$|Economy {{of labor}} was the {{fundamental}} aim of a round barn’s design. <b>Feed</b> <b>chutes</b> connecting {{the upper and}} middle levels allowed for easy distribution of hay, stored in the spacious loft, and silage, stored in the central silo. Farmers could stanchion up to sixty cows around the center silo for feeding and milking and easily remove manure through trap doors that opened to the basement below where it could be collected and removed by horse-drawn wagons.|$|R
40|$|Plantains are wasted due to {{deterioration}} when {{dumped in}} villages and towns {{during the peak}} of harvest. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} plantains are processed into chips for preservation and availability throughout the year. Modern methods of slicing have greatly improved production rate and reduces slicing time. The main objective {{of this study was to}} modify an existing plantain slicing machine so as to optimize its efficiency at low cost, reduce total time of slicing and produce hygienic and quality chips. The improvement on the design of the existing slicing machine was achieved through proper focus on the capacity, materials and other design criteria for various component parts. The slicer consists of cutting disc, cutting chamber, <b>feeding</b> <b>chute,</b> the main frame and power transmitting unit. The result of the improvement on the design of this slicing machine showed that maintenance cost is cheap, slicing time of plantain chips was reduced, operation of the machine does not require special skill, the machine is easy and safe to operate, it is free of noise and vibration,the slicing method is continuous with two slicing blades provided inside the cutting chamber and energy for loading and unloading is reduced since <b>feeding</b> <b>chute</b> and collecting bucket are provided. Slicing of plantain is safe since finger injury is reduced. The efficiency of the modified plantain slicing machine is 95. 79 % with capacity of 50. 49 g/s. The slicer is therefore recommended for commercial use...|$|R
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, the M60 {{received}} the nickname [...] "The Pig" [...] {{due to its}} bulky size. Vietnam's tropical climate harshly affected weapons, and the M60 was no exception. Its light weight made the gun damage easily and critical parts like the bolt and op rod wore out quickly. Even so, soldiers appreciated the gun's handling, mechanical simplicity, and effective operation {{from a variety of}} firing positions. Navy SEALs used M60s with shorter barrels and no front sights to reduce weight further. Some SEALs had <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> from backpacks to have a belt of thousands of rounds ready to fire without needing to reload.|$|R

50|$|The M197 {{remains in}} use in the latest AH-1W Cobra and AH-1Z Viper gunships. Although the weapon's rotary drive is {{theoretically}} quite reliable, its ammunition feed has been anything but: Marine pilots initially reported an alarmingly high jam rate (sometimes greater than 30%). The USMC and the manufacturer {{are aware of the}} problem and in 2011 a linkless feed system developed by Meggit Defense Systems was incorporated into the AH-1W and the Zulus. The system is capable of holding 650 +/-3 rounds in the storage unit with approximately 40 rounds in the <b>feed</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|E

Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.|$|E
5000|$|The M2 also {{appeared}} in a twin-mount version which paired two M2 guns with opposing <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> in one unit for operation by a single gunner, with a combined rate of fire of 2,400 rpm. All of the various [...]30 M2 models saw service {{in the early stages}} of World War II, but were phased out beginning in 1943, as hand-trained rifle-calibre defensive machine guns became obsolete for air warfare (the [...]50 in/12.7 mm M2 Browning and 20 mm Hispano HS.404 automatic cannon had replaced the [...]30 in as offensive air armament as well). The [...]30 in M2 aircraft gun was widely distributed to other US allies during and after World War II, and in British and Commonwealth service saw limited use as a vehicle-mounted anti-aircraft or anti-personnel machine gun.|$|R
50|$|Gas handgun {{magazines}} usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in {{a standard}} capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the <b>feeding</b> <b>chute.</b> Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} primary designs for a drum magazine. The most common is the {{cylinder}} type, {{that has a}} spider gear assembly that has an opening in each gear {{for two to three}} rounds of ammunition and can be loaded from the rear, used primarily in the AK-47. Another common design is the double-stack dual-horn drum, which operates like a standard stick magazine, but diverges the ammo into two separate <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> that run on a single cog. Rimmed ammunition including shotgun ammunition operated drums primarily run off a cogged (gear shaped) design which feeds each individual round of the ammo from the outermost edge of the drum. Recently a single-stack compact design has been released, which uses most of the interior capacity of the drum. It is driven by a single hub and telescopic shaft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s the US {{military}} {{was looking for}} an upgrade to the M1919 that could feed from either side for use as an improved coaxial machine gun. Saco-Lowell developed a model that had the driving spring attached to the back plate (eliminating {{the need for a}} mainspring and driving rod protruding out the back of the bolt), a solenoid trigger for remote firing, a feed cover that could open from either side, a bolt with dual tracks that could feed from either side, and a reversible belt feed pawl, ejector, and <b>feed</b> <b>chute.</b> The experimental T151 had a flat backplate (?), the T152 had spade grips and a [...] "butterfly" [...] trigger like the M2HB, and the T153 had a pistol grip and back-up trigger like the M1919A4 and an extended charging handle similar to those on the M1919A5. The T153 was adopted as the M37 and was produced by SACO-Lowell and Rock Island Arsenal from 1955 to 1957. It was in regular service from 1955 until it was replaced by the M37E1 in the late 1960s and the M73A1 in the early 1970s.|$|E

40|$|The present work aims {{to design}} and {{analysis}} of Ball mill inlet chute along with the truck assembly for Roller press circuit UMS (Unidan Mill S) type FLS Ball mill which {{are used in the}} Cement industry for grinding clinker material. The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the Roller press and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the Roller press and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from roller press to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The replacement of the liner plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck assembly at inlet chute. In this design, the Inlet chute will be fixed on the movable truck assembly which can be easily removable along with chute during the maintenance and liner plate replacement. The main objective of this project is to identify and design the suitable inlet chute for the BM+RP mill circuit with <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> truck assembly.

50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace through <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|R

40|$|IN MANY FACTORIES, the <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> of {{the first}} mill is {{operated}} with a high chute level {{for the purpose of}} maximising the cane rate through the mill. There is a trend towards trying to control chute level within a small control range near the top of a chute that can result in rapid changes in cane feeding rate to maintain the chute level set point. This paper reviews the theory that predicts higher cane rate with higher chute level and discusses the main weakness in the theory that it does not consider the beneficial effect on capacity of cane falling {{from the top of the}} chute to the top surface of the cane mat. An extension to the chute theory model is described that predicts higher capacity with lower chute level because of the effect of the falling cane. The original model and this extended model are believed to be the upper and lower limits to the true effect. The paper reports an experiment that measured the real effect of chute level on capacity and finds that increasing chute level does lead to higher capacity but that the trend is only about one-third as strong as the original theory predicted. The paper questions whether the benefits of slightly greater capacity outweigh the costs of operating with the small control range near the top of the chute...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this quarter of study was to prepare fuel pellets containing PVC, newspaper and plastics to be co-fired with coal in the AFBC combustor. The Western Kentucky University atmospheric fluidized bed combustion system requires the fuel to fall from a bunker into a lock-hopper, and from there into a mixing box where the fuel is auger-fed under pressure {{into the bottom of}} the fluidized bed. The fuel must flow freely out of the bunker and through the lock- hopper for proper feeding into the combustor. In order for the fuel to continuously fall through these units and into the mixing box during combustion, the density of the fuel and the size of the particles must meet certain requirements. The particles must be no larger than 3 / 8 inches in diameter and must have a density approaching that of coal.

40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel <b>feed</b> <b>chute.</b> Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Kömürlerin zenginleştirilmesi ya da yıkanması genellikle yaş yöntemlerle yapılmaktadır. Uygulanan yıkama işlemlerin büyük bir çoğunluğunun yaş yöntem olması, yani yıkama (ayırma) ortamının su ve kullanılan suyun büyük oranlarda olması, üretilen temiz kömürlerin ve atılan atıkların susuzlandırılması gerek ekonomik gerekse çevresel sorunlar doğurmaktadır. Susuzlandırma aşamalarında kullanılan yüksek oranda flokülantın kömür yıkama maliyetleri üzerindeki etkisi oldukça önemlidir. Bu sebeple, özellikle su problemlerinin yaşandığı Çin, Avustralya ve donma probleminin olduğu Rusya gibi birçok önemli kömür üreticisi ülkede, son zamanlarda kuru kömür üretimi üzerine çalışmalar başlatılmıştır. Türk kömürlerine uygulanabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve ortaya konulması geniş rezervlerimizin doğru olarak değerlendirilmesi açısından oldukça önemlidir. Bu çalışma kapsamında, - 15,- 15 + 4 ve - 15 + 1 mm boyut gruplarındaki kömür numuneleri Allair Jigi ile havalı ayırma işlemine tabi tutulmuştur. Bu ayırma işlemlerinde farklı nemlerdeki malzemeye farklı pülsasyon genlikleri ve farklı hava hızları uygulanmıştır. Uygulanan farklı hava hızlarını yataklanma-tabakalanma (sabit/akışkan yatak) üzerinde etkisi, basınç farklarının oluşturduğu eğriler ile ilişkilendirilip, her bir pülsasyon genliği, boyut ve kömür nemi için minimum akışkanlaştırma hava hızı belirlenmiştir. Soma imbat kömürlerine 120, 180, 240 ve 300 rpm (2, 3, 4 ve 5 s- 1) pülsasyon genliğinde uygulanan çeşitli hava hızlarına göre, tabakalandırma sırasında basınç düşüşleri ölçülmüştür. Minimum akışkanlaştırma hava hızı belirlendikten sonra, optimum akışkanlaştırma hava hızının tespiti için, zenginleştirme deneyleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Akışkanlaştırma hava hızının nem oranına bağlı olarak değiştiği, nem oranı arttıkça akışkanlaştırma hava hızının da arttığı belirlenmiştir. Ayrıca düşük nemlerde ve yüksek pülsasyon frekansı yüksek olduğunda tabakalanmayı olumsuz etkilediği belirlenmiştir. Akışkanlaştırma karakteristiği belirlenmesinde boyutun etkisi araştırıldığında görülmüştür ki malzeme içinde küçük boyut miktarı arttığında hava hızı düşük olduğunda buyuk tanelerin hareketlenmesi ve tabakalanması engellenmekte, hava hızı fazla olduğunda ise ince taneler ayırma işlemine maruz kalmadan pnömatik taşınma ile sistemi terketmektedir [...] Dolayısıyla malzeme oldukça dar boyut gruplarına ayrılarak zenginleştirme yapılmasının daha etkili olacağı saptanmıştır. Bununla birlikte ürün boşaltma sisteminin akışkanlaştırma özellikleri ile kontrol edilebilirliği de bu tez çalışmasında incelenmiştir. Coal {{enrichment}} processes or so-called coal washing are usually done in water medium. A {{vast majority of}} washing processes are wet using the separation medium of water; so {{the amount of water}} used in such processes is considerable. As a result, there are problems in dewatering of both produced clean coal and tailings in economic and environmental terms. Moreover, flocculation agents in high dosage used in dewatering processes increase the production costs. In the light of these facts, {{there is a tendency to}} processing of coal in dry basis and thus researchers have started on this issue especially in countries such as China and Australia, and in cold countries where there is icing problems like Russia; in all these countries water resource problems are acute. There is a great deal of work to make the dry beneficiation of coal competitive with conventional wet beneficiation processes. It is important to reveal the applicability of this method in the utilization of Turkish coals. Some technological measures and online data collection systems as well as an optimum process design for specific coal types are required to make this competition realistic as the physical properties of coal and its associated minerals play a major role on the separation efficiency especially in dry coal processing. Dry beneficiation techniques for coal processing such as hand picking, optical or X-Ray sorting, crushing size classification (accelerator) air jigs, air tables, FGX technologies, Akaflow aerodynamic separator, Tribo-electrostatic separator, air-dense medium fluidized bed, electrostatic separation and etc. have many advantages over wet processes in terms of economic and environmental concerns. Pneumatic beneficiations such as air jigs and air-dense medium fluidized bed have been commercialized and being applied in many countries. The efficiency of these processes basically depend on the difference in characteristics of coal and gang minerals such as density, particle size, shape factors, magnetic and electro static susceptibility. In gravity based dry processing, stratification of coal is achieved through fluidizing and pulsating air, vibration and an oscillating deck in gravity based dry separators. There are a number of studies that show successful use of gravity based dry processing for coal cleaning indicating that dry beneficiation techniques can be well adapted to coals with different characteristics. In addition to coal processing, these dry processing methods are also open to beneficiation of different minerals such as sand, ferrous minerals, etc. or coal-like materials such as leonardite. In some applications, gravity based dry processing methods were also developed with modified system using different dense media such as sand, magnetite, magnetite fly ash, magnetic pearl and paigeite in separation of both inorganics, pyrite, and Hg. It was also reported that for the optimal separation of these impurities, using air table or fluidized bed separators, the operational parameters such as vibration amplitude, pulsation frequency, air volume, superficial air velocity, transverse angle, longitudinal angle and also coal properties like size and shape factor should be controlled carefully. Among these operational  parameters, pulsation frequencies and superficial air velocity were the most important in  governing the density based stratification and separation of the coal particles. In a fluidized bed system, a pack of solids is converted into a ﬂuidized bed by lifting action of air passing through it. Thus, three stages can be identiﬁed in the process of ﬂuidizing a bed of solids based on the velocity of air ﬂow through it; (i) ﬁxed or static bed, where the particles are in direct contact with each other, supporting each other's weight, (ii) expanded/ﬂuidized bed or particulate ﬂuidization where the particles have a mean free distance between particles and the particles are supported by the drag force of the ﬂuid, and (iii) mobilized bed. In fixed bed conditions, the particles remain in stationary contact whereas they are in free motion in a fluidized bed. When the fluid is passed upward through an unrestrained bed of particles, the bed will initially expand slightly to take up a loose packed arrangement. If the flow is increased, the pressure drop across the bed increases. Eventually the pressure drop equals the force of gravity on the particles (weight of the particles) and the particles begin to move. During this period, the porosity increases and the pressure drop rise more slowly than before due to the net effect of increased porosity and velocity. The bed is in extremely loose condition with the particles still in contact. The bed is unstable, the particles begin to lose contact and then adjust their position to present as little resistance to the flow as possible. With further increase on air velocity, the particles are separated and true or complete fluidization begins. By the time this position is reached, all particles are in motion and beyond that stiuation, the bed continues to expand and the particles move in a more rapid and independent motion. The pressure drop across the particles bed reaches a threshold, referred to as the point of incipient fluidization or minimum fluidization velocity. At that sitiution, all of the particles have been entrained in the fluid and pneumatic conveying exists. Dry beneficiation of the tested coals was performed through a Lab scale Allair Jig. Allair jig facility consisits of feed, separation (jigging) and powder filtering units. The fresh run of mine (ROM) coals were fed into a manual <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> associated with belt conveyor and accumulated in the second <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> where the feed rate was controlled by the stargates. Following the stratification of the feed in jigging cell by the fluidizing air from the fluidizing and pulsed air production and distribution mechanism towards the bottom part, the lighter coal particles floated and discharged automatically from the channel while the discharge of the dense materials through separated channel is controlled by the stargates by varying the rotational speeds. During stratification, a limited amount of powder is ventilated by the filter unit through the ventilation pipe. During the stratification, the operational conditions are adjusted by the control panel. On separation, pressure drops, Δp, for both part of the jigging cells were measured based on the fluidizing air rate by U-tube manometer to determine the minimum fluidizing air velocities, Umf, Umfa, Umf-cohesive. In this study, coal samples from Soma region of Turkey were used in the experiments. Coal samples of - 15, - 15 + 4, and - 15 + 1 mm in size were subjected to Allair jigging process. Samples of various moisture contents were cleaned in different pulsation amplitudes and air speeds. The effect of air speed on bedding and layering (fixed/fluid bed) and the impact of pressure difference was investigated. For each pulsation amplitude, particle size, and coal moisture content a minimum fluidizing air speed is introduced. In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed.

In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed. The effect of controlling product discharging system speed on bedding was also investigated in this study. The results obtained in this thesis have revealed that the negative effects arising from coal and device parametres on the separation efficiency would be brought to the minimum levels if the fluidization air velocity is set based on the variable conditions. It is also found that a controlled  product discharge/drainage system would be a possible feature for such an application, with a careful implementation of both fluidization characteristics and separation performance.

40|$|In June 2004, the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS) was {{initiated}} {{with the intent}} to design, construct, and operate a full-scale bulk vitrification pilot-plant to treat low-activity tank waste from Hanford Tank 241 -S- 109. The DBVS facility uses In-Container Vitrification{trademark} (ICV{trademark}) {{at the core of the}} treatment process. The basic process steps combine liquid low-activity waste (LAW) and glassformers; dry the mixture; and then vitrify the mixture in a batch feed-while-melt process in a refractory lined steel container. Off-gases are processed through a state-of-the-art air pollution control system including sintered-metal filtration, thermal oxidation, acid gas scrubbing, and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and high-efficiency gas adsorber (HEGA) filtration. Testing has focused on development and validation of the waste dryer, ICV, and sintered-metal filters (SMFs) equipment, operations enhancements, and glass formulation. With a parallel testing and design process, testing has allowed improvements to the DBVS equipment configuration and operating methodology, since its original inception. Design improvements include optimization of refractory panels in the ICV, simplifying glassformer addition equipment, increasing the number of waste <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> to the ICV, and adding capability for remote clean-out of piping, In addition, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has provided an independent review of the entire DBVS process. While the review did not find any fatal flaws, some technical issues were identified that required a re-evaluation of the DBVS design and subsequent changes to the design. A 100 percent design package for the pilot plant will be completed and submitted to DOE for review in early 2008 that incorporates process improvements substantiated through testing and reviews. This paper provides a description of the bulk vitrification process and a discussion of major equipment design changes that have occurred based on full-scale testing over the past two years and DOE reviews...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} civil {{engineering}} {{structures such as}} protection dams and mitigation walls against the impact of large-scale geophysical flows requires a fundamental knowledge of the underlying physics of granular flows around obstacles. It is now well established that large discontinuities in depth and velocity, namely standing waves, jumps and shocks, can be formed throughout the flowing granular body, at the upstream side of the obstacle. The current paper describes a newly established small-scale laboratory apparatus, a tank <b>feeding</b> a <b>chute,</b> designed for studying in detail {{the shape of the}} granular jumps across a wide range of flow conditions. These flow conditions include variation of the input flow rate, chute inclination and basal roughness. The preliminary tests presented here highlight the existence of complex transitions from strong shocks to very diffuse jumps either two or three dimensional in shape, and the possible development of a basal stagnant zone downstream of the jump...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a proper}} operation, the player turns the crank, which rotates a {{vertical}} gear, {{connected to a}} horizontal gear. As that gear turns, it pushes an elastic-loaded lever until it snaps back in place, hitting a swinging boot. This causes the boot to kick over a bucket, sending a marble down a zig-zagging incline (the [...] "rickety stairs") which <b>feeds</b> into a <b>chute.</b> This leads the marble to hit a vertical pole, {{at the top of}} which is an open hand, palm-up, which is supporting a larger ball (changed later on to a marble just like the starter one). The movement of the pole knocks the ball free to fall through a hole in its platform into a bathtub, and then {{through a hole in the}} tub onto one end of a seesaw. This launches a diver on the other end into a tub which is on the same base as the barbed pole supporting the mouse cage. The movement of the tub shakes the cage free from the top of the pole and allows it to fall on the mouse.|$|R
50|$|The next hurdle {{surprised}} White and Hazard - {{there were}} in general, as was witnessed by the legislator's comments, a wide divergence of opinion {{as to whether the}} Lehigh could be tamed, and perhaps more surprising, there were less backers of any scheme to continue mining coal from the lands held by LCMC - there were simply too many failures over the 24 years of its operations for the peace of mind of many investors. Accordingly, three times the funds were raised to improve the river as were raised to put the mining U delivery of coal onto a regular paying basis. Given permission, the two companies went to work, and overstocked the market demand in 1820, having opened practical, though not ideal navigability of the Lehigh over four years ahead of their targeted 1824. Coal mining and delivery by grading a near constant descent mule track from Summit Hill to <b>feed</b> a loading <b>chute</b> at the huge slack water pool created at Mauch Chunk, went well as well; the coal deposits were essentially outcrops needing little effort to extract. Riding this success, the two companies were merged into the Lehigh Navigation Company, resolved to apply the high tech of the American Canal Era (canals, locks, rails) to bringing coal to their foundries and the stoves and furnaces of Philadelphia and beyond.|$|R
