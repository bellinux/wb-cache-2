60|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{himself that}} he has made no mistake in the hour he replaces the watch and walks rapidly southward up the street two squares, turns to the right and as he approaches the next corner fixes his eyes on an upper window in a three-story building across the way. This is a somewhat dingy structure, originally of red brick and now gray. It shows the touch of age and dust. Built for a dwelling, it is now a factory. I do not know what is made there; the things that are commonly made in a factory, I suppose. I only know that at two o'clock in the afternoon of every day but Sunday it is full of activity and clatter; pulsations of some great <b>engine</b> <b>shake</b> it and there are recurrent screams of wood tormented by the saw. At the window on which the man fixes an intensely expectant gaze nothing ever appears; the glass, in truth, has such a coating of dust that it has long ceased to be transparent. The man looks at it without stopping; he merely keeps turning his head more and more backward as he leaves the building behind. Passing along to the next corner, he turns to the left, goes round the block, and comes back till he reaches the point diagonally {{across the street from the}} factory--point on his former course, which he then retraces, looking frequently backward over his right shoulder at the window while it is in sight. For many years he has not been known to vary his route nor to introduce a single innovation into his action. In a quarter of an hour he is again at the mouth of his dwelling, and a woman, who has for some time been standing in the nose, assists him to enter. He is seen no more until two o'clock the next day. The woman is his wife. She supports herself and him by washing for the poor people among whom they live, at rates which destroy Chinese and domestic competition.|$|E
50|$|MultiAir {{technology}} can increase power (up to 10%) and torque (up to 15%), {{as well as}} reduce consumption levels (up to 10%) and emissions of CO2 (up to 10%), particulates (up to 40%) and NOx (up to 60%) when compared to a traditional petrol engine. The system also provides smoother cold weather operation, more even torque delivery and no <b>engine</b> <b>shake</b> at shut-off.|$|E
5000|$|The Achilles {{heel of the}} 195 was <b>engine</b> <b>shake.</b> An inline {{four-cylinder engine}} suffers from {{secondary}} imbalance. This is caused because of the 180 degree crankshaft. In this design, the two outside cylinders are always moving together and the two inside cylinders are doing the same. But due to geometry, a piston descending from top dead center will always move quicker through the first 30 degrees of crankshaft travel than a piston moving upward from bottom dead center, meaning that more mass is moving downward than is moving upward, causing a shaking in the vertical plane. Modern engineers consider the installation of twin counter-rotating balance shafts necessary for engines much larger than 122 cui (2.0 L). The V8-based design of the 195 had no such balance shafts since costs prohibited adding them. The 195 was instead cushioned by flexible rubber engine mounts designed to isolate the engine {{from the rest of}} the car, and its forces were further dampened by the Tempest's unusual driveshaft (which connected to a transaxle mounted in the rear). However, if the engine was out of tune or if a spark plug became fouled, the shaking overwhelmed the dampening of the mounts. The timing chain in the 195 was originally the same as the 389, but was prone to stretch and break from engine vibration; a special high-strength version was developed as a replacement. This also works on the V8 engines as a high strength upgrade.|$|E
60|$|When {{the tide}} had risen and flowed past, oily smooth, under the full moon, the {{windlass}} began to rattle and the cable clanged. The anchor {{came up and}} when the <b>engines</b> <b>shook</b> the ship Mayne pulled the whistle-line and a long blast rolled across the woods. Next moment a rocket soared and burst {{in a shower of}} colored lights.|$|R
60|$|The {{reversed}} <b>engines</b> <b>shook</b> {{the ship}} and the anchor plunged. She stopped, and but for {{the roar of the}} breakers all was quiet. Somehow Miguel had brought her across the sands. When she dragged out her cable the guns were hoisted up and put near the gangway, where, if needful, one could heave the boxes overboard. Miguel cleared the cargo launch ready for launching and they stripped the covers from a lifeboat.|$|R
6000|$|Lying in his hot {{steerage}} bunk, {{stripped to}} his under-shirt, Carl {{peered through the}} [...] "state-room" [...] window to the swishing night sea, conscious of the rolling of the boat, of the <b>engines</b> <b>shaking</b> her, of bolts studding the white iron wall, of life-preservers over his head, of stokers singing in the gangway as they dumped the clinkers overboard. The Panama was pounding on, on, on, and he rejoiced, [...] "This is just what I've wanted, always." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} method for identifying parameters of a double-chamber hydraulic mount and {{a study of}} application for adaptive hydraulic mount are presented. “Lever Model” is able to {{be described as a}} mechanical model of a double-chamber hydraulic mount as well as a single-chamber. Simulated dynamic properties of the “Lever Model” coincides a measured one and to be validated. Adaptive hydraulic mount equipped with switch-orifice was designed by using above analytical method and confirmed good idle shake and <b>engine</b> <b>shake</b> for a FWD passenger car...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{engine mounts}} {{are applied to}} the {{automotive}} applications to isolate the chassis from the high frequency noise and vibration generated by the engine {{as well as to}} limit the <b>engine</b> <b>shake</b> motions resulting at low frequencies. In this paper, a new hydraulic engine mount with a controllable inertia track profile is proposed and its dynamic behavior is investigated. The profile of the inertia track is varied by applying a controlled force to a cylindrical rubber disk, placed in the inertia track. This design provides a hydraulic engine mount design with an adjustable notch frequency location and also damping characteristics in shake motions. By using a simple control strategy, the efficiency of the proposed hydraulic engine mount in two-mode operation meaning isolating mode in the highway driving condition and damping mode in the shock motions, is investigated...|$|E
5000|$|The rollout of the Yukon was a near-disaster {{when the}} {{prototype}} {{could not be}} pushed out of the hangar since the tail was unable to clear the hangar doors. The first flight took place 15 November 1959 at Cartierville Airport. During test flights many problems were encountered from complete electrical failure to <b>engines</b> <b>shaking</b> loose and almost falling off. Rolls-Royce had problems delivering engines, resulting in the sarcastically-named [...] "Yukon gliders" [...] being parked outside Canadair as late as 1961.|$|R
50|$|On 10 July 2011 Kalka Mail derailed on the Kanpur-Fatehpur line {{near the}} Fatehpur railway station, more than 72 persons died and 200 were injured, some critically. The train was hauled by Ghaziabad-based WAP-7 30221. Malfunction of the undergear of the {{locomotive}} {{could also be}} a reason. The driver of the Kalka Mail said he saw the <b>engine</b> <b>shaking.</b> A post-accident diagnostic revealed that the first axle (leading) of the locomotive registered a jerk and the fourth axle (trailing bogie) showed loss of contact of the wheel with the track. The locomotive in question has been re-railed and is undergoing fault diagnostics and repairs.|$|R
40|$|Was 1974 a watershed? It was dawning of the {{information}} age, a period of rapid technological advance associated {{with the introduction of}} information technologies. It also was the start of a sharp rise in income inequality and signaled the beginning of the productivity slowdown. Were these phenomena related? Could they have been the result of an Industrial Revolution associated with the introduction of information technologies? The answer offered here is yes, and a simple theory connecting the phenomena is outlined. Evidence is presented showing that the coincidence of rapid technological change, widening inequality, and slowdowns in productivity growth are not with out precedence in economic history. Just as the steam <b>engine</b> <b>shook</b> 18 th century England, and electricity rattled 19 th century America, it is argued that information technologies are rocking the 20 th century economy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a prototype active engine mount (AEM) system designed for commercial passenger, requiring a good engine vibration solation performance. The AEM {{consists of a}} conventional hydraulic engine mount and an internal electromagnetic actuator. The robust H∞ controller was adopted to cancel out the force transmitted through the AEM. The vibration isolation performance tests were carried out by simulating the <b>engine</b> idle <b>shake.</b> The experimental result confirmed that can control unwanted vibration from the engine operation by using active mounts...|$|R
25|$|That night, the {{submarine}} fired six torpedoes at {{a ship that}} was being towed by a smaller freighter. Five of the torpedoes missed, and the sixth made a circular run and passed over {{the submarine}}'s <b>engine</b> room. A <b>shaken</b> crew broke off the attack.|$|R
5000|$|... 1985 {{brought the}} Monster 4x4s, much larger {{vehicles}} powered by C-cell batteries. Also new were the Speedsters, sports cars with steerable wheels {{and their own}} special track, and Zanees, which features huge <b>engines</b> that <b>shook</b> and made noise. Stomper Overdrives featured an over-running clutch mechanism. Futuristic vehicles made up the new Future Force line. A four-wheeled ATV joined the All-Terrain Cycles line, and two new Super Dragsters were added. The rest of the line was continued largely unchanged, though the Competition Pull Set was dropped.|$|R
50|$|Both the Damas and Labos {{are only}} {{available}} with a manual transmission. Air conditioning is optional. But the 0.8-litre engine hasn't got sufficient power to both carry cargo swiftly and deliver cold {{air from the}} aircon unit {{at the same time}} without struggling. The <b>engine</b> struggles and <b>shakes</b> (potentially leading to a stall) if you try both. However, for its purpose, the car is excellent, reliable, durable and nippy around town and outskirts, as long as speeds over 100 km/h (62 mph) are not required - beyond which the car becomes uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|Devine {{returned}} and threw him down a spade, {{and for the}} next hour Harding worked steadily, digging a trench to the buried wheels and beating its bottom flat. When his comrade came back they lined it with the logs he brought, and Harding started the <b>engine.</b> The machine <b>shook</b> and rattled, straining and panting under a full head of steam, but the wheels churned furiously in the soil and smashed the ends of the logs they bit upon. One big piece shot out of the trench and narrowly missed Devine, who fell among the harrows when he jumped. Harding stopped the engine as his friend got up.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1953, the 581st {{lost one}} of its B-29s and its entire fourteen-man crew while flying a leaflet drop mission over North Korea near the Chinese border. The {{aircraft}} had already dropped leaflets over five North Korean towns and was beginning its last run over the village of Cholson. Some of the leaflets carried war news, but others warned of an impending bombing attack by United Nations forces. Suddenly enemy searchlights lit up the sky, and in a rare night attack, a MiG-15 fighter attacked the B-29, setting afire its right inboard <b>engine.</b> The bomber <b>shook</b> as the tail gunner responded to the attack. Two more MiGs swept by the bomber, this time hitting the number three and four engines with machine gun and cannon fire. With the plane falling from the sky, the crew bailed out. Three of the crew died in the crash, but the remaining crewmen, including the 581st Wing Commander were captured and sent to a camp in China. They were imprisoned as war criminals by the Chinese engaged in [...] "espionage". They were held past the June 1953 Korean Armistice and subjected to an international publicized propaganda trial. Later under growing international pressure, the Chinese released the eleven airmen on 3 August 1955, making them the last Korean War American prisoners to be released by the Chinese communists.|$|R
