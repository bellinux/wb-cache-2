40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution to}} estimate the effective diameter of a naturally aspirated internal combustion engine intake pipe is presented in this paper. A formula to predict the effective diameter for the geometry of the intake pipe {{as a function of}} cylinder bore, stroke, engine speed, pipe length, ambient temperature and aerodynamic losses, is created. In this analysis, the kinetic energy of a charge column in the period of a <b>filling</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the maximum kinetic energy are taken into consideration. A comparison between the results of the novel suggested formula and the actual published work to determine the intake pipe diameter is done for different engines. The results indicated that a good agreement {{to estimate the}} intake pipe diameter, especially in high-speed engines is obtained...|$|E

40|$|The brachistochrone curve for a non-dissipative {{particle}} {{tries to}} maximize inertia of the particle {{but for a}} fluid <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder,</b> increasing inertia would amount to increased dissipative losses. Hence the trade-off between inertia and dissipation plays {{a vital role in}} determining the brachistochrone curve of a fluid <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This trade-off manifests itself {{in the form of an}} integro-differential equation governing the angular acceleration of the cylinder. Here, we compute the brachistochrone curve of a fluid <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> using optimal control principles and investigate the effect of the aforementioned trade-off on the deviation of the brachistochrone curve from that of a non-dissipative particle. Also, we investigate the effects of the non-dimensional parameters of the problem on the shape of the brachistochrone curve. We then analyze the stability of the time varying fluid flow in the cylinder and find an admissible region for the terminal point which would ensure the stability of the fluid flow as the cylinder rolls along the brachistochrone curve.

40|$|The {{effects of}} tilt and {{structural}} asymmetry on the vibration characteristics of partly liquid-filled thin-wall cylinders were experimentally studied. It {{was found that}} tilting the longitudinal axis of a partly <b>filled</b> axisymmetric <b>cylinder</b> from the vertical could markedly reduce its resonant frequencies and change significantly {{the shape of the}} circumferential modes. For the minimum frequency modes, vibratory motion occurred only {{on that side of the}} cylinder where the liquid was deepest. An empirical equation was derived that gives the equivalent liquid depth of an untilted cylinder having the same minimum resonant frequency as a tilted, partly <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Circumferential mode shapes of an untilted asymmetric cylinder were similar to those of the tilted, partly <b>filled</b> axisymmetric <b>cylinder.</b> Vibratory motion in the minimum frequency modes occurred in most instances only on the side of minimum thickness.

40|$|The {{computational}} {{and experimental}} results of impact loading a water <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{with a high}} speed piston are presented. Computational simulation of the impact process is performed by means of DIANA, a commercial finite element software package. In this simulation, water is modeled as a solid with very small shear modulus compared to the bulk modulus of water. The efficiency of the simulated impact is evaluated by the time dependent water pressure {{in the vicinity of}} the cylinder. Also, the shock pressure resulting from impact is detected by using a pressure transducer located in the middle of the water tube. Comparison of the computational and experimental results shows that the impact process on a water <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> is well modeled.

40|$|Abstract Background For many long {{standing}} practices, {{the rationale for}} them is often lost as time passes. This is the situation {{with respect to the}} storage and handling of equimolar 50 % nitrous oxide and 50 % oxygen volume/volume (v/v) mixtures. Methods A review was undertaken of existing literature to examine the developmental history of nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures for anesthesia and analgesia and to ascertain if sufficient bibliographic data was available to support the position that the contents of a cylinder of a 50 %/ 50 % volume/volume (v/v) mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen is in a homogenous single gas phase in a <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> under normal conditions of handling and storage and if justification could be found for the standard instructions given for handling before use. Results After ranking and removing duplicates, a total of fifteen articles were identified by the various search strategies and formed the basis of this literature review. Several studies were identified that confirmed that 50 %/ 50 % v/v mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen is in a homogenous single gas phase in a <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> under normal conditions of handling and storage. The effect of temperature on the change of phase of the nitrous oxide in this mixture was further examined by several authors. These studies demonstrated that although it is possible to cause condensation and phase separation by cooling the cylinder, by allowing the cylinder to rewarm to room temperature for at least 48 hours, preferably in a horizontal orientation, and inverting it three times before use, the cylinder consistently delivered the proper proportions of the component gases as a homogenous mixture. Conclusions The contents of a cylinder of a 50 %/ 50 % volume/volume (v/v) mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen is in a homogenous single gas phase in a <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> under normal conditions of handling and storage. The standard instructions given for handling before are justified based on previously conducted studies. </p...|$|R

The gun's barrel slid back on rollers, pushing a piston into an oil <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, at the end of recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. By this time smokeless powder had replaced gunpowder as the standard propellant.|$|R
40|$|The flow in a {{completely}} <b>filled</b> <b>cylinder</b> driven by a rotating endwall has multiple time-dependent stable states when the endwall rotation exceeds a critical value. These states have been observed experimentally and computed numerically elsewhere. In this article, the linear stability of the basic state, which is a non-trivial axisymmetric flow, is analysed at parameter values where the unsteady solutions exist. We show that the basic state undergoes a succession of Hopf bifurcations and the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these excited modes describe most {{of the characteristics of}} the observed time-dependent states. 1...|$|R
