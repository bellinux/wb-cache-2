50|$|As {{the washer}} rose {{up in the}} air, the student's head would also tilt upward as he tracked its flight. At the instant the gun was seated against his {{shoulder}} and his cheek, it would be aligned to match {{the position of the}} rising <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> in its trajectory. Accordingly, the student's subconscious mind then had very little fine-tuning to do to direct the muscles of his left arm to point the gun so the fired BB would hit the target. Five important factors were involved here. First, in shouldering the air rifle, the student would never bend his head so as to press his cheek against the gun-stock; instead, he would shoulder the gun {{in such a way that}} the gun-stock would be pressed against his cheek with his head still erect (i.e., he would move the gun to accommodate his head, not his head to accommodate the gun). Second, he would consistently shoulder the gun exactly the same way each time. Third, he would never hesitate before pulling the trigger, but would pull it the instant the gun was seated against his shoulder and his cheek, making a controlled snap-shot. (If he delayed the shot and tried to track the washer and align his gun with his conscious mind, he could never become proficient at this type of shooting.) Fourth, the student never once looked at the gun barrel; instead, he stared at the <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> until he pulled the trigger, and then he focused upon the flight of the BB he had shot to see where it would go in relation to the washer. And fifth, McDaniel would cock the BB gun for the student for each shot, so as to avoid tiring the student and spoiling his concentration. It was not enough for the student merely to perceive the flight of the aerial target; he had to focus and concentrate solely upon it for McDaniel's training program to work. If the student began tiring, McDaniel would declare a short rest period. The student had to concentrate his full attention on the target.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{target was}} {{generally}} a <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> {{the size of}} a silver dollar. McDaniel would balance it on the third finger of his right hand and loft it straight up into the air {{in such a way that}} it would remain parallel to the ground as it rose and fell, and he would give it a spin for stability with his thumb and forefinger as it left his hand. He would throw it about a foot in front of the student, so that it would rise 10 or 12 feet and then fall straight down again. McDaniel would tell the student to hold his gun at a high port-arms (diagonally in front of him with the barrel tilted up) initially, and to be look up in the air. When the washer entered the student's field of view, he would focus upon it and follow its flight, and move both forearms to pivot the gun to seat the butt against his shoulder, with the stock against his cheek, and pull the trigger the instant the gun was seated.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} the Ultra Soft X-ray (USX, 1. 5 keV, Al Kα) photon beam of a customized lab bench cold cathode generator. Within this generator, the electron beam is slowed down in a thin aluminium foil (16 μm) supported by an easily exchangeable anode. It is shown that {{the thickness of the}} foil and the anode configuration determine the spatial distribution and the fluence rate of the photon beam, whereas accelerating voltage determines both fluence rate and energy spectrum feature. It is shown also that under specific operation parameters (i. e. accelerating voltage), a Gaussian energy distribution of the beam can be generated which is centred on the energy of the Al Kα line (1. 5 keV). Dosimetric films of GAFCHROMIC® HD- 810 were used to estimate the photon fluence rate distribution of the beam. Its variation, when the generator acts as a monoenergetic source, was characterized with the two different configurations of the anode assembly. Finally, it is verified that the anode assembly consisting in a <b>flat</b> <b>washer,</b> on which the aluminium foil is set, acts as a simple point-source...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{because this}} {{phenomenon}} occurred routinely, {{it was obvious}} that the student's eyes were actually registering, and his subconscious was actually perceiving, the location of the first BB's dent in the spinning washer, but not sending that information to the conscious mind. However, the student's subconscious mind would then direct his muscles to point and shoot the gun so that the second and third BB hits would lie right next to the first one. The student's subconscious had previously memorized the trajectory of BB's fired from that particular gun, and it had also memorized a time-to-target table of BB's fired from it to hit targets at different distances. Now, while the student's current target, the <b>flat</b> <b>washer,</b> went sailing up into the air, the student's subconscious was computing and extrapolating the trajectory of that washer on that particular throw, its ever-decreasing rate of climb, and its ever-decreasing spin-rate. And his subconscious was solving all of those guidance-and-control problems so rapidly and accurately, directing the applicable muscles of his body with such precision, causing the student to group his first three hits within a millimeter of one another on the rapidly spinning flat washer—by selecting precise points to aim at that he could not even see, then hitting right next to them.|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} factors easing the {{pressure}} on the student. One of the most important steps was to eliminate the complications of noise and recoil when the gun was fired, which the use of the BB gun as the training aid did. The second step was to make it as easy as possible for the student to begin hitting the target right away. To do that, McDaniel not only threw up a large <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> for the student, but also lofted it straight up into the air, parallel to the ground, and gave it a spin for added stability. This presented the student with the easiest possible target. But if the student could not begin hitting that target quickly, then McDaniel would switch to a larger target. Occasionally, he would find it necessary to throw up an aluminum pie-plate right above the muzzle of the student's BB gun with the goal of getting the student to hit the target regularly, as it was then just a matter of shrinking the size of the target in small steps. The final factor here was that McDaniel was not a sadistic shooting instructor. He liked people and thoroughly enjoyed teaching them to shoot, and he let that show, nurturing his students and letting them know that he was on their side. All of those factors combined to give the student great confidence.|$|R
50|$|Lavatories {{and water}} closets {{normally}} {{connect to the}} water supply {{by means of a}} supply, which is a tube, usually of nominal 3/8 in (U.S.) or 10 or 12 mm diameter (Europe and Middle East), which connects the water supply to the fixture, sometimes through a flexible (braided) hose. For water closets, this tube usually ends in a <b>flat</b> neoprene <b>washer</b> that tightens against the connection, while for lavatories, the supply usually ends in a conical neoprene washer. Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or 'fast joint'ed directly onto the water supply pipes.|$|R
50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R
40|$|A Belleville washer can be best {{described}} as a non <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> with a conical shape and a uniform cross section. They are also known as disk springs and as the name suggests they are often utilised for their load bearing capabilities. Due to their compactness along the axis of loading and {{a wide range of}} attainable load-deflection characteristics they are an attractive alternative to conventional springs. Though Belleville washers are primarily used for their load bearing capabilities, they {{can also be used to}} build a damping device; which in turn can be used as part of a suspension system. The non linear deflection of the spring makes it difficult to predict the resulting pressure-flow characteristic and as a result the damper pack is built either by an experienced operative or by a trial and improvement method. Without an analytical tool to predict the behaviour a designer cannot exploit the full functionality of this type of spring. The intension of this paper is to present research undertaken to develop a correlation which describes the pressure drop required for various flow rates when using Belleville washers as damping elements. Using existing load deflection theory an initial model was developed to relate load with pressure and deflection with flow area which could be used to estimate flow rate. The solutions from a computer simulation showed similar trends to those found in the experimental study, but they estimated smaller pressure drops for a given flow rate. It was postulated that the exit velocity of the fluid created a region of low pressure which tended to close the opening and thus increase the pressure drop. This hypothesis was examined and confirmed with a computational fluid dynamic simulation and the results were used to modify the existing model. Analysis of the new model showed good agreement with the experimental study...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the student}} pulled the trigger, McDaniel would have him change his focus from the aerial target (initially, the big flat-washer) {{to a point}} two feet beyond the muzzle of the BB gun. There the student would pick up and track the flight of the BB he had fired and {{register}} {{the direction in which}} his BB missed the target (using an imaginary clock-face with the target at the center) and the distance of the miss. The student would then tell himself that for the next shot, he was going to miss the target by the same distance but in the opposite direction. If the student proved unable to convince himself of that, and continued missing consistently in the same direction each time, McDaniel would tell him that instead of focusing directly upon the next thrown target, he should focus upon a point in space the same distance from the target but in the opposite direction from his previous miss. If that didn't work, McDaniel would tell him to double the distance of the previous miss. In such manner, the student would swiftly learn how to bracket the target with each of his succeeding shots; and shortly thereafter, he would inevitably begin hitting the target. When the student could hit the initial target regularly, with about 80% accuracy, McDaniel would switch to a smaller target, usually progressing from a <b>flat</b> <b>washer</b> the size of a silver dollar to one the size of a half dollar, then the size of a quarter, then a nickel, dime, empty [...]22-short cartridge case, and finally an aspirin tablet. (If McDaniel really liked the student, and had enough time for it, he would teach the student to hit two or three out of ten thrown BB's in the air.) This basic training for bird hunters and police officers generally took about three hours.|$|R
