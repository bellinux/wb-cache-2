Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and <b>fergusonite.</b>|$|E

40|$|Stable social {{development}} requires novel approaches for energy production, distribution and storage combined with reasonable restrictions {{of the environmental}} impact. The fuel cell-based technologies, {{as well as the}} separation of gases from mixtures, particularly implemented into innovative power plant concepts, are therefore in the scientific and political focus. At the very core of these technologies are selected materials from a number of classes ranging from purely organic-and inorganic-based matrices to the precious metals and alloys that all ought to meet well defined operation-relevant conditions and efficiencies. Depending on the targeted application, each material foreseen as a base for component development has to be evaluated individually and its properties have to be modified i n terms of corresponding application requirements. In order to elaborate tailored ceramic materials for gas separation and ion/electron transport at the relevant operating conditions and stability ranges, improved electrical or ionic conductivities and permeation rates are required. That can be achieved by doping and substitution which are actors on a nano-scale that usually lead to macroscopic impacts. This chapter is dedicated to the fascinating world of tailoring ceramic materials for energy and environmental applications. Selected approaches to tune ceramics will be discussed to illustrate the versatile effects that compositional variation can have on the macroscopic properties, e. g. the conductivity of protons, oxygen ions and/or electronic carriers, stability, etc. The present chapter will therefore consider the structural features of selected material classes, as well as the principles of transport in bulk and microporous solids. It will furthermore illustrate and discuss the effects of selected additives and substituents on sinterability, electrical/electrochemical properties and stability of selected ceramic materials for energy and environmental applications. The material variety will cover ceramic materials with different crystal structures like fluorites, perovskites, pyrochlores, <b>fergusonites,</b> as well as selected zeolite structures...|$|R
40|$|Nb and Ta are geochemically related {{elements}} {{which typically}} {{give rise to}} isomorphous series of oxides as accessory minerals in granitic pegmatites (e. g. columbites, pyrochlores, <b>fergusonites,</b> etc). However, {{in spite of the}} natural occurrence of orthorhombic alumotantite (AlTaO 4), its Nb counterpart is only known as a synthetic product. AlNbO 4 crystallizes with monoclinic symmetry (s. g. C 2 /m) and was early described with a strict ordering of Nb and Al, respectively over M 1 and M 2, the two non-equivalent octahedral sites in the structure [1]. This model was revised by successive refinements showing that a partial disorder occurs in AlNbO 4 with a ~ 20 % inversion degree [2, 3]. CrNbO 4 is a disordered MM'O 4 compound, crystallizing with the rutile structure (s. g. P 42 mnm) while FeNbO 4 crystallizes with wolframite (s. g. P 2 /c), orthorhombic α-PbO 2 -type, rutile, or AlNbO 4 -type structure as the temperature increases. This brief review shows that, even at room conditions, the chemical nature of the metal cations M 3 + strongly affects the crystal structure of MM'O 4 -type oxides. In order to better understand the substitution mechanisms, the cationic ordering, the structural stability, and the phase transition processes for (M 3 +) (Nb 5 +) O 4 compounds, six samples along the (Al 1 -xCrx) NbO 4 join (x: 0. 0 – 0. 5) were synthesized by the solid-state reaction process and investigated by means of a X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and electron absorption spectroscopy (EAS) combined approach. Monophasic up to x(Cr) = 0. 125 apfu (AlNbO 4 -type structure), the samples along the join become biphasic (the former plus the CrNbO 4 -type structure) for x(Cr) > 0. 125 apfu, indicating the impossibility to have a complete solid solution between (Al,Cr) NbO 4 oxides. The lattice parameters increasing with the Al–Cr substitution defines a structural expansion limit (x(Cr) > 0. 24 apfu) that is ascribed to the maximum chromium content that the structure can accept. The samples up to x(Cr) = 0. 25 also exhibit the typical optical spectra of Cr 3 + in 6 -fold coordination, involving d-d electronic transitions. Ascertained that the proposed octahedral ordering models were corrected [2, 3], through different refinement strategies, the global instability index, GII [4], was calculated over the un-doped structure by varying the Al/Nb ratio in the two metal sites. Unpredictably, even the minimal values of GII obtained are very close to the limit of 0. 20 v. u. that implies strained structures. With a crystal field strength that decreases moving from x(Cr) = 0. 06 to 0. 50 apfu, and both the Racah parameters and the nephelauxetic trends nearly constants, no significant change in the degree of covalency and polarization of the Cr–O bond are found. The 10 Dq decreasing suggests an elongation of the local Cr–O distance for Cr 3 + increasing at site M 2 and to a minor extent at site M 1, fitting well the structural data on the long-range mean bond distances. The degree of structural relaxation around Cr 3 + was also assessed by means of the relaxation coefficient ε, until the structure will maintain the same symmetry. The AlNbO 4 lattice has a limited propensity to relax (ε≈ 0) and the AlNbO 4 structure follows the Vegard’s law. In contrast with the well known Al–Cr joins in garnets, spinels, perovskites and corundum, the AlNbO 4 structure is strongly constrained by other factors, like cation ordering and electrostatic charge balance. Indeed, the M 2 site hosting Al 3 + is underbonded and Cr 3 + can be accommodated at this site without significant strain for that the lattice does not need to relax around the bigger ion.

Described by the United States Geological Survey as one of the greatest deposits of rare-earth minerals in the world, the pegmatite was the first place geologists discovered <b>fergusonite,</b> monofergusonite, thorogummite, yttrialite, and nivenite. The pegmatite is centrally located in the Lone Grove pluton, a 1.6 Ga old rapakavi granite, intruded into Valley Spring Gneiss. Geologic evidence suggests the pluton's emplacement as a rather shallow intrusion of magma, possibly in a sub-caldera type situation. An original depth of five to seven kilometers may be assumed for the present level of exposure (Denney). Prior to mining, the hill was described as 40 ft tall by about 100 ft wide and 250 ft long. Hess describes the intrusion being surrounded by a graphic granite of peculiar beauty and definite structure, being more like a text-book illustration. A central quartz mass was described more than 40 ft across, with distinct white bands, from one-eighth to one-half inch wide. Within the white bands were found fluid inclusions and bubbles that moved only slowly when the specimen was tilted. Between these bands the quartz is glassy and clear. At one place a vug was found large enough for a man to enter, lined with smoky quartz crystals reaching 1000 lb (500 kg) or more in weight. A large crystal of smoky quartz was removed that weighed over six hundred pounds (270 kg). It was 43 in high and 28 in broad and 15 in thick (1090 by 710 by 380 mm).

40|$|Room-temperature Raman {{scattering}} {{has been}} measured in barium tungstate (BaWO 4) up to 16 GPa. We report the pressure dependence {{of all the}} Raman-active first-order phonons of the tetragonal scheelite phase (BaWO 4 -I, space group I 41 /a), which is stable at normal conditions. As pressure increases the Raman spectrum undergoes significant changes around 6. 9 GPa due to {{the onset of the}} structural phase transition to the monoclinic BaWO 4 -II phase (space group P 21 /n). This transition is only completed above 9. 5 GPa. A further change in the spectrum is observed at 7. 5 GPa related to a scheelite-to-fergusonite transition. The scheelite, BaWO 4 -II, and <b>fergusonite</b> phases coexist up to 9. 0 GPa due to the sluggishness of the I?II phase transition. Further to the experimental study, we have performed ab initio lattice dynamics calculations that have greatly helped us in assigning and discussing the pressure behaviour of the observed Raman modes of the three phases.

40|$|Room-temperature Raman {{scattering}} {{has been}} measured in lead tungstate up to 17 GPa. We report the pressure dependence {{of all the}} Raman modes of the tetragonal scheelite phase (PbWO 4 -I, space group I 41 /a), which is stable at ambient conditions. Upon compression the Raman spectrum undergoes significant changes around 6. 2 GPa due to the onset of a partial structural phase transition to the monoclinic PbWO 4 -III phase (space group P 21 /n). Further changes in the spectrum occur at 7. 9 GPa, related to a scheelite-to-fergusonite transition. This transition is observed due to the sluggishness and kinetic hindrance of the I-to-III transition. Consequently, we found the coexistence of the scheelite, PbWO 4 -III, and <b>fergusonite</b> phases from 7. 9 to 9 GPa, and {{of the last two}} phases up to 14. 6 GPa. Further to the experiments, we have performed ab initio lattice dynamics calculations which have greatly helped us in assigning the Raman modes of the three phases and discussing their pressure dependence.

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} structural {{behavior of}} europium orthovanadate {{has been studied}} using in-situ, synchrotron based, high-pressure x-ray powder diffraction technique. Angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements were carried out at room temperature up to 34. 7 GPa using a diamond-anvil cell, extending the pressure range reported in previous experiments. We confirmed the occurrence of zircon-scheelite phase transition at 6. 8 GPa and the coexistence of low- and high-pressure phases up to 10. 1 GPa. In addition, clear evidence of a scheelite-fregusonite transition is found at 23. 4 GPa. The <b>fergusonite</b> structure remains stable up to 34. 7 GPa, the highest pressure reached in the present measurements. A partial decomposition of EuVO 4 was also observed from 8. 1 to 12. 8 GPa, however, this fact did not preclude {{the identification of the}} different crystal structures of EuVO 4. The crystal structures of the different phases have been Rietveld refined and their equations of state (EOS) have been determined. The results are compared with the previous experimental data and theoretical calculations.

40|$|SEM-EDS {{techniques}} {{are used to}} study minute-sized crystals of HFSE minerals in an evolved batch of fluorine-rich granite. The batch separated due to buoyancy from the bulk magma before fluid separation was reached. Fluorine acted as the main complexing agent in the magma, facilitating the transport of many elements. Enhanced concentrations of elements like Nb, Y, REE, Th and possibly Be gave the granite an accessory mineral composition {{similar to that of}} NYF pegmatite. Biotite was chloritized and often no remaining biotite can be identified. Frequent are two minerals from the aeschynite-euxenite-polycrase group. One is blocky and formed together with chlorite. It was replaced by an acicular variety, which continued to crystallize into the late hydrothermal stage. Bastnäsite and synchysite are also common in the granite. Both started crystallizing together with chlorite, but only synchysite can be followed into the late hydrothermal stage. Hingganite and gadolinite occur as inclusions in fluorite and chlorite. Galgenbergite formed as fracture-fillings. Some other rare minerals have merely been identified as accidental inclusions, but their identification is less certain. They include brenkite, fluocerite, <b>fergusonite</b> and possibly håleniusite. Chemical heterogeneities in the minerals point to incomplete equilibratio...|$|E
