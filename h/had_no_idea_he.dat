But it's like this, the way I look at it, I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>he</b> was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
500|$|The show made {{reference}} of Jack's love triangle storyline with CNBC host Avery Jessup and {{his high}} school sweetheart Nancy Donovan, played by actresses Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore, respectively. This plot was first introduced in the April 22, 2010, episode [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". The love triangle dilemma would continue throughout the season.

500|$|In April 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers {{for the main}} cast of the series. Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series, I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>he</b> was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it {{and thought it was}} well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Keir as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Nigel Kneale {{had long}} been highly {{critical}} of Brian Donlevy's interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. A number of actors were considered for the part including André Morell who had played Quatermass in the television version of Quatermass and the Pit. However, Morell {{was not interested in}} revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on Scottish actor Andrew Keir who had appeared in supporting roles in a number of Hammer productions including The Pirates of Blood River (1962), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964) and [...] (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled, “The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn't want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More... {{and it was a very}} unhappy shoot. [...] Normally I enjoy going to work every day. But for seven and a half weeks it was sheer hell.” Roy Ward Baker denied he had wanted Kenneth More, who he felt would be [...] "too nice" [...] for the role, saying, “I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>he</b> [...] was unhappy while we were shooting. His performance was absolutely right in every detail and I was presenting him as the star of the picture. Perhaps I should have interfered more.” Keir went on to appear for Hammer in The Viking Queen (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971). He reprised the role of Quatermass for BBC Radio 3 in The Quatermass Memoirs (1996), making him the only actor other than Donlevy to play the role more than once.|$|E

According to Robertson [...] "This was no accidental arrest, no fortunate stumbling across a news team. They [...] had planned this all along." [...] The taxi driver, who was driving the crew and Robertson, was also held. According to Robertson the taxi driver had [...] "done nothing more than give us a ride.

He also used the type font from our very first single, and I {{asked him about it}} and he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>He</b> was just on point." [...] Fairey also remarked [...] "I use red {{frequently}} because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding." [...] The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork.|$|E
