5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez.

He said he did this because he had left <b>his</b> <b>keys</b> in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E

500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets <b>his</b> <b>keys</b> down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
500|$|Individual {{episodes of}} the series contain {{additional}} references to the Sherlock Holmes tales.

In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as [...] "Moriarty", the name of Holmes's nemesis. In the season four episode [...] "It's a Wonderful Lie", House receives a [...] "second-edition Conan Doyle" [...] as a Christmas gift. [...] In the season five episode [...] "The Itch", House is seen picking up <b>his</b> <b>keys</b> and Vicodin {{from the top of}} a copy of Conan Doyle's The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. In another season five episode, [...] "Joy to the World", House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message [...] "Greg, made me think of you." [...] Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler. [...] The series finale pays homage to Holmes's apparent death in [...] "The Final Problem", the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.|$|E
500|$|West {{recorded}} a verse by rap artist Nas—one of his idol rappers—for the track [...] "We Major" [...] without informing Jay-Z, {{who at the}} time was engaged in a [...] G.O.O.D, music label-mate Really Doe also appears on the track, delivering its elongated chorus. West later revealed that part of the reason he created the song was to dismantle the feud between the MCs, which they did later that year. [...] "Hey Mama", dedicated to his mother Donda West, was first recorded by West as early as 2000. Brion ran into some obstruction while conducting a twenty-piece orchestra for [...] "Celebration", as its musicians found themselves giggling at West's humorous lyrics which hampered their playing. [...] On [...] "Roses," [...] West and Brion had some minor discord; Brion initially layered it with keyboard arrangements, only for West to remove <b>his</b> <b>keys</b> along with the beat and completely reconfigure the entire song {{in such a way that}} its verses are built around the rhythm formed by his vocals and Brion's arrangements arrive during the choruses. Brion later lightheartedly compared the indecision surrounding the construction of the track to that of Prince's famous last-minute removal of the bass line from [...] "When Doves Cry." [...] According to Patti Labelle, she contributed vocals to [...] "Roses". [...] "I was in his studio one night, and [...] and his mother both asked if I'd just sing something on this song", Labelle recalled. [...] "I didn't get a credit on the album because the liner notes had already been printed up." ...|$|E

In [...] "Hungry Man," [...] Rita works hard to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot Larson (Rick Peters), when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives.

In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub [...] Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere [...] "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.|$|E
