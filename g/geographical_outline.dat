The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea {{to take advantage of the}} predictable monsoon winds.

In other parts of the book too he goes into raptures over such images as the changing colors of a flock of geese on the horizon, or of some beautiful leaves on an apple tree.His progression with all its ups and downs from tiny Ferghana to Hindustan would in itself ensure him a minor place in the league of his great ancestors, Timur and Jenghiz Khan; but the sensitivity and integrity with which he recorded this personal odyssey, from buccaneer with royal blood in his veins revelling in each adventure to emperor eyeing in fascinated amazement every detail of his prize, gives him an added distinction which very few men of action achieve.|$|R

40|$|Observations {{of human}} {{behaviour}} show {{a tendency for}} avoiding energy expenditure through stair climbing where possible. Similarities between demographic influences in stair avoidance and explicit perceptions of <b>geographical</b> slant <b>outlined</b> in the ‘economy of action’ account (Proffitt, 2006) suggest that this avoidance behaviour {{might be due to}} a perceptual bias. Chapter two of this thesis investigated measures of slant perception linked to action. It appears that these ‘haptic’ measures tap into a perceptual process that is more in touch with the physical reality of the environment than conscious awareness. Chapter four demonstrated that fundamentals of the economy of action account generalise to the perception of staircases, and to a newly developed laboratory setting. Depletion of energetic resources, manipulated through fatigue, resulted in steeper explicit estimates of staircase steepness. In reaction to published criticisms of the methodology used in this field, chapter five took a new approach to testing the effect of resources on perception. Two quasi-experimental field studies, designed to circumvent methodological issues challenging the validity of previous studies, demonstrated that available energy resources affects consciously perceived steepness in the built environment. Chapters six and seven built on this by testing the economy of action account as a model that explains stair avoidance behaviour. Encouragingly, across two different points-of-choice between stair climbing and avoidance, explicit measures of perceived geographical slant were linked to reported prior stair climbing behaviour at one site (chapter six) and objectively measured behaviour at another (chapter seven). Collectively, these findings suggest that available energetic resources dictate the exaggeration of perceived geographical slant experienced at an individual level, and that this in turn influences stair choice behaviour, biasing those with less resources towards stair avoidance and energy preservation...|$|R
40|$|Using {{landscape}} {{objects with}} geo-visualisation tools to create 3 D virtual environments is {{becoming one of}} the most prominent communication techniques to understand landscape form, function and processes. Geo-visualisation tools can also provide useful participatory planning support systems to explore current and future environmental issues such as biodiversity loss, crop failure, competing pressures on water availability and land degradation.

40|$|In {{this study}} we seek to analyse the ability of {{students}} to explain, exemplify and <b>outline</b> <b>geographical</b> processes, {{as well as to}} assess their competencies by using an evaluation grid. Therefore, we tested two types of hypotheses. The first one regards the fact that it becomes more difficult for students to represent a previously learned geographical process in writing, than to outline it graphically. The second Hypothesis highlights the fact that the ability to graphically represent a geographical process is more difficult to achieve, than the ability to represent a previously learned geographical process through sketches. We went through several steps such as: the preliminary analysis of students’ products; writing the text; setting up the criteria of analysis for products; grouping the products on the specific criteria; organizing the evaluation grid of competencies; inserting data in the tables; and the elaboration of the paper. We chose this type of approach due to the lack in evaluation grids, which we created according to the analysis of products. We used both qualitative and quantitative type of analysis, as well as data collecting, processing and interpretation. What is important to mention is that the students find it easier to represent a geographical phenomenon through a sketch previously learned rather than by using a written discourse. The sample of evaluation grid that resulted from this study can be used by the professionals in didactics, but it can be developed a new one, specific to students.

40|$|Abstract Elimination of endemic measles {{transmission}} is {{the culmination of}} a range of control measures at a national level. Current documentation of elimination proposed by WHO’s regional offices requires achieving specific targets for surveillance process indicators. We demonstrate how Australia, although not meeting these specific targets, has satisfied multiple criteria that justify the formal declaration of measles elimination. Our review shows that few countries previously declaring measles elimination have satisfied the current WHO surveillance targets. We argue that the requirements for recognition of measles elimination should not restrict countries to a particular type of surveillance system or surveillance criteria.

The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) has nominated the target date of 2012. 1 Since measles elimination was first proposed, definitions of elimination have progressed from requiring a reduction to zero in the incidence of infection in a defined geographical area, 2 to the absence of endemic measles transmission and the lack of sustained transmission following an importation of measles virus in a large and well populated <b>geographical</b> area, as <b>outlined</b> in guidelines by WPRO. 3 The indicators adopted by WPRO to monitor the progress towards measles elimination provide an operational definition of measles elimination. 3, 4 Papania & Orenstein have argued that elimination can be declared if multiple lines of evidence demonstrate the absence of endemic measles transmission. 5 Several countries have declared elimination of endemic measles transmission using criteria that have become more rigorous over time (summarized in Table 1, available at...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, the New Zealand Deprivation Index (NZDep) {{has been the}} {{universal}} measure of area-based social circumstances for New Zealand (NZ) and often the key social determinant used in population health and social research. This paper presents the first theoretical and methodological shift in the measurement of area deprivation in New Zealand since the 1990 s and describes {{the development of the}} New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). We briefly describe the development of Data Zones, an intermediary <b>geographical</b> scale, before <b>outlining</b> the development of the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which uses routine datasets and methods comparable to current international deprivation indices. We identified 28 indicators of deprivation from national health, social development, taxation, education, police databases, geospatial data providers and the 2013 Census, all of which represented seven Domains of deprivation: Employment; Income; Crime; Housing; Health; Education; and Geographical Access. The IMD is the combination of these seven Domains. The Domains may be used individually or in combination, to explore the geography of deprivation and its association with a given health or social outcome. Geographic variations in the distribution of the IMD and its Domains were found among the District Health Boards in NZ, suggesting that factors underpinning overall deprivation are inconsistent across the country. With the exception of the Access Domain, the IMD and its Domains were statistically and moderately-to-strongly associated with both smoking rates and household poverty. The IMD provides a more nuanced view of area deprivation circumstances in Aotearoa NZ. Our vision is for the IMD and the Data Zones to be widely used to inform research, policy and resource allocation projects, providing a better measurement of area deprivation in NZ, improved outcomes for Māori, and a more consistent approach to reporting and monitoring the social climate of NZ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study, in {{relation}} to geography education and with a historical perspective, the challenges of knowing and understanding the world. The cases are all from Sweden. In the first paper, educational ideas in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries are studied, and the results indicate that some of the previously criticised educational ideas that were perceived as resulting from the ideas of nineteenth century regional geography in fact can be observed in earlier centuries and were criticised during the nineteenth century. In the second paper, school children’s ability to locate <b>geographical</b> names on <b>outline</b> maps is compared with children’s ability to complete the same task 45 years earlier. A total of 1, 124 students were included in the latter study, and the results were compared with those from a study of 1, 200 students from the same town conducted in 1968. The results raise questions regarding the picture of the continuous decline in children’s school results and show, for example, that children today are better at locating continents on a world map. The final paper identifies a new aspect of map reading difficulties. These difficulties in map reading are increasingly important in our global society, i. e., how the edges of the world map cohere. The paper shows that many map readers, children and adults, respond according to the idea of linear peripheral continuity, which indicates that the proposed continuation is along the straight line that continues tangentially to the original route when it crosses the edge. In general, this understanding leads to incorrect interpretations of the continuation of world maps.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} metalwork deposition, {{distribution and}} association in the British Early Iron Age (800 - 600 BC) {{through the medium}} of the socketed axe. Out of 1412 known Early Iron Age axes, 954 specimens were analysed in detail for this thesis: 680 associated finds and 274 single finds. The methodology was governed by two main objectives: firstly, to propose a reworked and more comprehensive typology of Early Iron Age cast copper-alloy and wrought iron socketed axes in conjunction with their metallurgy, distribution and deposition, and secondly, to discuss their place within Early Iron Age society and what part they may have played in the people’s life, work, trade and exchange, ritual and death. As a result, this thesis introduces, defines and discusses 12 new types of transitional and Early Iron Age socketed axes. While the transitional type can be dated to the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age transition (c. 850 - 750 BC), the remaining 11 types can be dated to the fully developed Early Iron Age (800 - 600 BC). The 11 types of bronze Early Iron Age socketed axes display a great variety of decoration, shape, size, weight and colour. While Late Bronze Age axes are plain or simply ribbed, almost all Early Iron Age socketed axes are decorated with ribs-and-pellets, ribs-and-circlets or a more elaborate version thereof. Some axe have a shiny silver surface colour (Portland, Blandford, East Rudham and Hindon types). More than three quarters of Early Iron Age socketed axes were found in association with other metalwork. These hoards can be divided into two main groups: axe hoards and mixed hoards. The eight <b>geographical</b> regions <b>outlined</b> in this thesis are defined by different contexts, associations and the predominance of different Early Iron Age axe types, and in terms of depositional contexts this research suggests that the depositional contexts of Early Iron Age hoards containing socketed axes was different from the deposition of single finds: while hoards were often found in retrievable places, single finds were not. The survival {{of a large number of}} complete and almost undamaged bronze axes suggests that in the British Early Iron Age socketed axes were not just commonplace tools that were in use until they reached the end of their life. The changes in looks and shape, and consequently the adaption of a new and improved typology of socketed axes in the British Early Iron Age were accompanied by a change in conceptualisation and the overall meaning of socketed axes. Even when used in a different context their basic, very recognisable socketed-axe-shape was always maintained, that is a wedge of different dimensions with a socket and a small side loop for suspension or possible attachment of other items of metalwork. Throughout British prehistory axes were one of the most familiar objects in daily use: as a tool, socketed axes were omnipresent and thus an established part of British Late Bronze Age life – a life that appeared to be foremost practical rather than ritual, with the majority of Late Bronze Age socketed axes showing clear signs of use and resharpening. In the Early Iron Age socketed axes adopted a previously unseen duality in function and meaning (that is materialistic and symbolic). Thus, while Late Bronze Age axe may have been regarded as common woodworking tool, types of Early Iron Age axes were understood as ingots, weapons, or objects needed for certain displays or performances, with their unique ornaments communicating their role in both display and society as well as perhaps their users regional identity and status...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{first person}} films as {{platforms}} for producing alternative subjectivities within contemporary Turkey. Its central question is: “Considering {{its history and}} power structures, how do first person films address the limitations and potentials of forming diverse subjectivities within contemporary Turkey?” This question is addressed through a video diary practice and coupled with a theoretical inquiry. The video installation Of Dice and Men negotiates hegemonic identity politics in Turkey through moments of rupture and constant migration within my daily routines in London and Istanbul — both shaped by political violence. Migratory subjectivities are thought through Félix Guattari’s proposal of molecular subjectivities, which was fruitful for enacting such subjectivities in a geography where identity is largely monolithic. The video installation Of Dice and Men is thus born of negotiating hegemonic identity politics in Turkey {{as well as a}} conformist filmmaking industry. In terms theory, one persistent question was: “How can a filmmaking method with a strong history, theorized foremost for US and European contexts, be a platform for alternative (in Guattari’s words, molecular) forms of subjectivity reflective of the specificities of Turkey?” The thesis thus proposes an expansion of the history and theorizations of first person film, through Guattari’s notions of the molar and the molecular. To elaborate and probe the above problematic I discuss recent first person films and how they address subjectivisation through normative ideologies in Turkey, pertaining to two separate but intertwined spheres of identity formation. M. M. Arslan explores Kurdish-Turkish conflicts in I Flew You Stayed (2012), while Aykan Safoğlu’s Off-White Tulips (2013) explores queer subjectivity and migration. Within this focus are multiple aims: 1) mapping the limits, if not dangers, of imposing a single identity on the body politic of an entire <b>geographical</b> region; 2) <b>outlining</b> issues of subjectivity in contemporary Turkey; and 3) examining filmmakers who use first person narrators to challenge the hegemonic perspectives linked to the formation of modernity. I conclude with reflections on the construction of an author persona through my own filmmaking method in Of Dice and Men. Furthermore, presenting my work as an installation led to thinking through fluid subjectivities and reflecting on active modes of spectatorship. The installation thereby stands in a mutual questioning and expanding relationship to the written component of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} path of a tourism destination area centered around a special nature reserve and adjacent rural communities {{in the northern part}} of Serbia. Utilizing evolutionary economic geography (EEG) as an increasingly present theoretical and conceptual framework in the studies of tourism, this research project employs key EEG concepts of ‘path dependence’ and ‘co-evolution’. ‘Path dependence’ examines different social, economic, institutional and sectoral factors that direct, propel and/or hinder destination development, while ‘co-evolution’ analyzes causal and relational exchanges of stakeholders within and associated with the destination. The objective of this study is to trace developmental and relational trajectories of the nature reserve, tourism enterprises in its vicinity, and the place and role of public sector in these processes. The study, therefore, aims to analyze: (1) how the concept of ‘path dependence’ applies to the tourism development path of the nature reserve; (2) the dynamics of co-evolutionary and relational exchange processes in the nature reserve destination area, namely those occurring between actors operating in both public and private sectors. The two combined EEG approaches, previously not applied within the <b>outlined</b> <b>geographical</b> context, serve to illustrate and explain overall development mechanisms within a tourism destination, relevant economically, socio-culturally as well as environmentally for its region and on the tourism market of Serbia. When methodology is concerned, the study is in form of a case study, with primary data drawn from semi-structured, in-depth interviews and supported with complementary data from relevant scientific articles, government documents, web sites and other publications. The study findings show that the nature reserve in its tourism growth displays a path dependence determined by two seemingly diverging factors: (1) rules and regulations pertaining to protected areas such as nature reserves dictate tourism development and (2) the reserve management entrepreneurial skills play a noteworthy role in shaping its tourism growth. Apart from path dependence, the tourism development path associated with the nature reserve displays path plasticity, which represents a new direction in tourism growth based on the existing infrastructural and managerial framework. Moreover, the study outcomes indicate that levels, directions and intensity of co-evolutionary and relational exchanges among all stakeholders included demonstrate several different patterns. While there is detectable relationship between the nature reserve and most local tourism-related stakeholders, relationships among local stakeholders themselves are rather uneven. Similar patterns are found regarding the involvement of public sector. Public sector is closely linked with the nature reserve, however, its association with other tourism stakeholders in the destination area is uneven.   These findings support the idea that each destination area stands as a unique and complex entity, with various endogenous and exogenous factors shaping its growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries (EAF) {{has been developed}} {{during the last decade}} in response to perceived and actual deficiencies in previous methods of management. The EAF recognizes that fish are only one albeit important part of a much wider ecosystem incorporating an array of physical and biological components that humans interact with and exploit. Rather than managing single fish stocks, an EAF is concerned with the impacts of fisheries on the marine ecosystem, the interactions between different fisheries, of fisheries with the aquaculture sector, as well as with other human activities. The Geographic Information System (GIS) is considered an ideal platform upon which to perform necessary information management and decision-support analysis for the implementation of an EAF. This technical paper is primarily intended to be a guide to methods that readers could adopt for their own use of GIS for an EAF and these methods are covered in some detail. The planning considerations for an appropriate GIS in terms of objectives, scope and <b>geographical</b> area are <b>outlined.</b> The practical considerations are discussed and include hardware architecture, various software possibilities, sources and types of data that will be needed, and the array of backup and support that is available. More specifically, in Section 1 of this paper, the conceptual basis underlying EAF is discussed. In Section 2, a four-step participatory ecosystem management planning and implementation process consistent with EAF is recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and includes: (i) scoping for issues, (ii) setting objectives, (iii) formulating rules and (iv) establishing a monitoring, assessment and review system. In Section 3, the use of GIS is examined beginning with a brief look at its history and development and then reviewing its current application and uses within marine fisheries. In Section 4, the potential use of GIS {{in a wide range of}} EAF-related projects is illustrated using examples that focus on mapping, modelling, management and communication. The degree to which GIS is currently being used for EAF implementation is illustrated by four case studies detailed in Section 5. Section 6 proposes a plan for implementation of an EAF using GIS and considers the challenges faced by developing countries in using GIS in fisheries management. Strategies to enhance the role of GIS in EAF are suggested. In conclusion, Section 7 makes recommendations for the adoption of GIS for EAF. The adoption of GIS for an EAF is no easy task and a number of challenges must be faced but GIS for EAF is feasible even in relatively resource-poor situations. The authors hope this paper encourages fishery managers and researchers to explore the many benefits of GIS for managing fisheries in an ecosystem context...|$|R
40|$|For {{almost five}} decades, Europe’s two-pole {{division}} {{used to define}} the specific nature of conflicts as global, ideological, nuclear. In the two-dimensional configuration {{of the time of}} ideologies, inter-ethnic disagreements used to be suppressed and subordinated to the global confrontation. The new time, the new world order are ‘liberating the spirit’ of ethnoses and are marked by a strong drive for self-determination. In the beginning, there was the unification of Germany, then followed the dissolution of multinational federations. The division is going on within the new states as well. The strive for social community has ethnic and confessional identity as its basic criterion. 	Disintegration processes are especially strong in Central and Eastern Europe. The priority motivation of the dynamic transition in the former communist countries is the desire to compensate for the historical chances for independent development that have been lost during decades. This ambition complicates the patchwork of nationalities that is being rearranged by changing borders and homogenizing the ethnic composition. History, religion, folklore, language are a means of self-assertion. They are mobilized by the feeling of insecurity and by the idea that a nation ‘does not appear by itself’. 	In the south-eastern part of the continent, the historical development and the excessive emotional charge of the modern urge to self-determination orient the choice towards power politics. it is the means by which a solution is being sought for the ethnic problems {{after the collapse of the}} multinational Yugoslav federation. The division of the territory and the formation of national states on the basis of former Yugoslav republics is being done through a military conflict which has taken too long, accompanied by destruction and many lost lives. The geographical names of the emphasis change but the conflict continues: after Slovenia and Croatia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then in Kossovo, probably soon to be in Macedonia and all the time in Serbia. It is hard to create the formula for compromise, not to speak of a stable solution for the diverging interests of the different ethnoses. 	The study of the specific dimensions of destructive processes allows one to view the Yugoslav crisis as an extreme manifestation of the emancipation of nationality, which is characteristic of the collapse of totalitarianism and the transition towards a new political system. As a result of the changes in the late 1980 s, it has become impossible to conceal the national contradictions that have been accumulated for decades. There is a shift of the value orientation towards national ideas at the expense of the all-European criteria synthesized in the concept of democratism. The dominating idea in former Yugoslavia is not the apology of the democratic process but the defence and development of the national interest. 	The context of interpretation of the conditions that predetermine ethnic conflicts in the case of Yugoslavia is directed towards revealing their universality. In order to represent its nature, the problematic is centred in three conflict zones - Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kossovo, and Macedonia. Ethnic conflict in each of them has specific dimensions but they share common roots and similar results. Their analysis is organized on a problem basis with several standing points such as the revival of national identity, the legalization of group rights, the strive for ethnic homogeneity and the radicalization of nationalism. The peculiarities in the three conflictogeneous areas is used to substantiate the conception of the general regularities valid on the wider regional scale. 	The new risks do not presuppose the existence of a collective threat to most of the European continent. Ethnic conflicts are localized and their destructive potential affects most of all the immediate participants and the neighbouring countries. However, the war is unacceptable, with its numerous victims and destruction in the middle of Europe - a war lead under the pressure of emotions and radical nationalism. It is unleashed and growing in a time when, outside the territory of Yugoslavia, the ambition dominates for the establishing of a new world order, for more security and for taking advantage of the opportunities for social prosperity. The Yugoslav conflicts build up the counterpoint of united Europe and aggravate the isolation of its south-eastern part. These dimensions motivate the active position of international organizations and their efforts towards the settlement of the crisis. The international security organizations try out diverse approaches for influencing it. Conferences have been organized within the European Union - the Hague (1991), London (1992), Geneva (1993); consultations have been carried out in the OSCE, resolutions of the UNO Security Council have been adopted on declaring defence zones in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and on introducing an arms embargo and economical ban against the federal republic of Yugoslavia; for the first time in Macedonia, preventive diplomacy has been applied which is being implemented successfully through dislocating international military forces under the aegis of UNO; the Atlantic Union is taking commitment to direct military operations in the settlement of the crisis. The conflict in the collapsing federation comes out to be a kind of laboratory for developing and testing different approaches for the settlement of crises arising after the end of the Cold War. Most generally, the problem goes down to the right of interference with the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and with the purpose of urgent defence of human rights. 	Through tracing the numerous initiatives for influencing the ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kossovo and Macedonia, the attitude and the politics of the leading countries is being elucidated in each considered case. The emphasis, however, is put on what surpasses the <b>outlined</b> <b>geographical</b> dimensions, that is, the development of a common position and the application of different means for the settlement of ethnic confrontation. The complexity of this process is clarified as well as the difficulties it faces in its development because the efficacy of approaches is being tested ‘in operation’. The case of Yugoslavia is the specific occasion that uncovers the need of reaching a higher degree of coherence in the politics of international forces. Through the involvement in it, the ‘modern’ essence of the world organizations and the parameters of their participation and contribution. 	The specific nature of ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kossovo and Macedonia is elucidated more clearly in the description of their essence and development after the signing of the Dayton Treaty. The signed agreement for interrupting military action is being viewed only as the beginning of the peace process in former Yugoslavia. In its development, it faces difficulties of diverse kinds. The strive has been preserved towards splitting the territory and homogenizing the population on national criteria. The nationalistic desires for building new states through...|$|R
