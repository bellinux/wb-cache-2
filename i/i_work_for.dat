[...] The US State Department has a virtual monopoly on information in such cases, but refuses {{to act as a}} vigorous advocate for left-behind American parents while also preventing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or anyone else from playing that role. State Department attorney Thomas Johnson remarked that when he reminded one senior State Department official with Child Abduction Convention responsibilities that she works for the American people, her immediate response was: [...] "I don’t work for the American people; <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Secretary of State", [...] demonstrating the Department's inherent conflict of interest (i.e., a desire to maintain [...] "good" [...] bilateral foreign relations for their own sake that overrides assertive and effective advocacy on behalf of American citizens).|$|E
2500|$|In late 1998 {{and early}} 1999, {{tensions}} between the Chrétien and Martin camps started {{to come out in}} the open with backbenchers loyal to the two men leaking unflattering stories to the press about their rival patrons. Chrétien rarely changed the composition of the Cabinet, and so as a result, there had emerged by the late 1990s a group of deeply disgruntled Liberal backbenchers, who believed themselves to be Cabinet-worthy MPs, and were extremely frustrated that the Prime Minister would not elevate them to the Cabinet. This group become Martin's strongest supporters as they believed that only by deposing Chrétien could they achieve the promotion to the Cabinet that they so desperately desired. A major advantage enjoyed by the Martin fraction was that in a process starting in 1995 they were able to take control of much of the Liberal Party apparatus reaching a point about 1999 where Martin supporters had an almost undisputed control of the Liberal party as opposed to the government. When asked in an interview about why Chrétien allowed this to happen, Sergio Marchi said: [...] "He just became complacent". Chrétien tended to focus his efforts on controlling the government via the PMO with one of his aides at the PMO Terry Mercer making the revealing remark during a meeting of the Liberal national executive in 1998 that: [...] "I don't work for the party, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Jean Chrétien". This tendency had become especially acute by the late 1990s when Chrétien was widely seen to have lost touch with the Liberal Party apparatus and caucus, and was described by Marchi as living in a [...] "bubble" [...] comprising himself and his people at the PMO with relations with those outside of the [...] "bubble" [...] growing more cold and distant as time went by. Chrétien was well aware of the Martin group and its ambitions, but as he believed that Martin had trouble making difficult decisions that the danger was minimal because [...] "Mr. Dithers" [...] Martin would never make up his mind. An additional problem for Martin in challenging Chrétien was that beyond the differences between Chrétien's [...] "hard federalist" [...] approach to Quebec and Martin's [...] "soft federalist" [...] approach, there were no major policy differences between him and the Prime Minister. Since the Clarity Act and Chrétien's entire [...] "Plan B" [...] approach to Quebec were very popular in English Canada, challenging Chrétien on that issue was considered to be unwise, and with no other issue to take a stand on, it was hard for Martin to make a case that Chrétien needed to go. Martin was not very likely to rally much support in English Canada on the thesis that Chrétien needed to be deposed because he was being too tough with the separatist government in Quebec City. Through Martin did not publicly oppose the Clarity Act, he also initially refused to voice support for it in public and several of his aides and Martinista MPs leaked the news to the media that the Finance Minister did not believe that the Clarity Act was a wise piece of legislation.|$|E
