5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume <b>in</b> <b>litres,</b> but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial gallon {{is used as}} a unit of {{measure for}} fuel in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Burma, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis and St Vincent and the Grenadines.

25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{nitrogen content}} (in gram) of urea (in mmol) {{can be estimated}} by the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol. Furthermore, 1gram of nitrogen is roughly equivalent to 6.25grams of protein, and 1gram of protein is roughly equivalent to 5grams of muscle tissue. In situations such as muscle wasting, 1mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume <b>in</b> <b>litres</b> multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/l) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67gram.|$|E

2500|$|Rival {{performance}} {{claims by}} Airbus and Boeing {{appear to be}} contradictory, their methodologies unclear and neither are validated by a third party source. [...] Boeing claims the 747-8I to be over 10% lighter per seat and have 11% less fuel consumption per passenger, with a trip-cost reduction of 21% and a seat-mile cost reduction of more than 6%, compared to the A380. The 747-8F's empty weight {{is expected to be}} 80 tonnes (88 tons) lighter and 24% lower fuel burnt per ton with 21% lower trip costs and 23% lower ton-mile costs than the A380F. On the other hand, Airbus claims the A380 to have 8% less fuel consumption per passenger than the 747-8I and in 2007 Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's 747-400 fleet. Emirates' Tim Clark also claims that the A380 is more fuel economic at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83. One independent, industry analysis shows fuel consumption <b>in</b> <b>litres</b> per seat per 100 kilometres flown (L/seat/100km) as 3.27 for the A380 and 3.35 for the B747-8I, or a fuel cost per seat mile of $0.055 and $0.057 respectively. A possible, as yet uncommitted, re-engined A380neo is expected to achieve [...] 2.82 or 2.65 L/seat/100km depending on the options taken.|$|E
