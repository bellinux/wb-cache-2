5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to pass underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close {{for the rest of}} that weekend.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1964, a B-52H {{flown by}} Boeing test pilots lost its {{vertical}} stabilizer to turbulence near East Spanish Peak. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> {{to land at}} Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|The barge {{was used}} to {{transport}} materials between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and after the diesel engines were added, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to push another barge. It was in service between 1941 and 1972, and afterwards was moored in Bridgeport Harbor together with the Berkshire No. 7 and Priscilla Dailey, two other barges.|$|E
5000|$|The Roboquad's legs all swivel {{around and}} so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to walk forward, {{backwards}} and sideways {{at about the}} same rate and mobility. <b>Its</b> head <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> to swivel around completely, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to scan its surroundings without turning its body.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> {{to invade}} {{a range of}} habitats, from pine flatwoods to {{mangrove}} marshes. It grows {{in a wide range}} of soil types, including salty coastal soil, but is sensitive to heavy salt spray. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> fire-adapted, meaning <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to resprout prolifically after fire.|$|R

5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to establish itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} was {{formally}} announced on 2 April after an LM convention. As the LM {{had already begun}} establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to pick up momentum readily, presenting itself as a centrist moderate party, {{but it was never}} able to shed its reliance on Hall.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short period}} of abandonment, Park Hall was {{purchased}} from the council by Mike Harris with a view to redevelopment and The New Saints moving back to the ground. The New Saints started to use Park Hall as their regular home ground again in 2007 and the ground was further improved so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to host matches in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> a nocturnal fish {{like many}} catfish. It feeds on living, {{as well as}} dead, animal matter. Because of its wide mouth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to swallow {{relatively}} large prey whole. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> known to take large waterbirds such as the common moorhen. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> to crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. Further, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to survive in shallow mud {{for long periods of}} time, between rainy seasons.|$|R
25|$|Also novel bio-assays like DR CALUX are {{nowadays}} used in {{identification of}} dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The advantage {{in respect to}} HRGC/HRMS <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to scan many samples at lower costs. Also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to detect all compounds that interact with the Ah-receptor {{which is responsible for}} carcinogenic effects.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from one bit to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{circulation}} was exposed from the convection, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to intensify into Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200UTC on December 3 while located 375km (230mi) northeast of Pohnpei. It {{turned to the}} west on December4, due to a ridge to the north. It slowly intensified, developing an eye feature on December5. That day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon about 1150km (715mi) southeast of Guam.|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to walk {{on either}} two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased {{the height of the}} back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E

5|$|Major League Baseball is {{a sports}} video game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is notable for {{being one of}} the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors {{and a loss of}} electrical power throughout the ship. Within an hour, the ship's main generators were restarted and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the aft harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously {{with their}} {{appearance}} on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it was confronted with a North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to disengage.|$|E
5000|$|The flightlessness of B. {{antarctica}} may be {{an adaptation}} to prevent wind from blowing it into inhospitable areas. [...] It can survive the freezing of its body fluids and has a lifespan of two years; with the two growing seasons, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to accumulate the energy needed to reproduce. With its deep purplish black coloration <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to absorb heat to survive. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> to tolerate large changes in salinity and pH and can survive without oxygen for 2 - 4 weeks.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 2007, SvalSat was {{expanded}} with 12 antennas. Five {{are used for}} Galileo, while the remaining are used for a large array of customers. In 2007 and 2008, both Terra and Landsat 7 were hacked twice. The hackers were able to achieve all steps {{which would have been}} necessary to take control over the satellites, but did not actually take control. The operation commanded the satellites via SvalSat, which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to hack via the Internet connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{bank had}} total assets of CHF 202million {{and a total}} shareholders' equity of CHF 46million. In 1917, UBS completed {{the construction of a}} new headquarters in Zurich on Bahnhofstrasse, considered to be the Wall Street of Switzerland. By 1923, offices were established throughout Switzerland. Although the bank suffered in the aftermath of World War I and the Great Depression, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to make several smaller acquisitions; in 1937 it established Intrag AG, an asset management business responsible for investment trusts, (i.e. mutual funds).|$|E
5|$|Unable to pry the Hürtgen from German hands, the Americans pitted the 4th Infantry Division {{into the}} battle and between 7 November and 3 December this {{division}} lost over 7,000 personnel. After also throwing the 8th Infantry Division into the attack <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> {{to take the}} town of Hürtgen, but {{was not able to}} advance much farther given the amount of casualties it had sustained. In total, American forces suffered 24,000 combat casualties and had failed to reach their original objectives, the dams.|$|E

5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
