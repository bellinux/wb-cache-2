40|$|My {{expertise}} is in developing patentable user centred design solutions and this investigation focussed on solving {{how to improve}} the loading and securing of the barbell weights for users during aerobic exercise routines. The inability to load and lock the free weights is caused by disc rotation, which disrupts the users exercise routines and can cause health and safety issues through tripping and falling over. This disruptive problem frequently occurs for users who participate in multiple person exercise routines that involve barbell and dumbbell activities in fitness centres and <b>gyms.</b> This systematic <b>user</b> centred investigation, supported by patent evaluations and ergonomic product testing, has generated an entirely new anti-roll barbell design and locking system. Through ethnographic research and user testing a D-shape disc and bar locking system was developed that addressed the limitations of existing solutions, eliminating all disc rotation. This means that a user can locate, load and reload disks without requiring rotation. The D-shape bar, which introduces a flat bearing surface and cam locking mechanism also address the limitations of existing solutions by improving the locking performance. It has also resulted in an entirely new visual identity within this category of product. The inventiveness of these features have been rigorously scrutinised via 13 -month patent assessment procedure. This has lead to successful granting of a UK patent. The systematic research leading to the anti-roll design informed {{the development of an}} anti-roll dumbbell for Reebok Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse whether men who regularly work out in the gym (<b>gym</b> <b>users)</b> can be differentiated from non-user university males from the general population according to the following variables: body image, altered eating habits and altered exercise habits. Two samples took part in the study: one with 78 <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> randomly chosen from gyms in Guadalajara (Jalisco-Mexico) and 340 non-user students from the UNIVA University in Guadalajara. The results of an attitude questionnaire show that as far as body image measured, there was no difference between <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> and non-user men from the general population. It was also observed that <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> had worse eating and physical exercise habits than the men surveyed from the general population. The intensity of the alteration in eating attitudes and attitudes towards physical exercise seem to be linked to the desire to have larger muscles as measured by a figure scale. These data indicate that <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> have a greater pathological tendency in eating and physical exercise habits than the general population. This may be related to engaging in a sport for an aesthetic outcome rather than for health reasons...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} exposure to the muscular male body ideal on body-focused negative affect among male <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> and non-exercisers.

Furthermore, the extent to which <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> were motivated to increase strength and muscularity moderated these exposure effects; men who reported stronger strength and muscularity exercise motivation reported a greater degree of self-enhancement after exposure to the muscular ideal.

Based on previous research, it was predicted that male <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> would report greater body image disturbance (e. g., body image avoidance and body dissatisfaction) and eating pathology, compared with non–gym users. Results of the study partially supported hypotheses, revealing body dissatisfaction and eating pathology were significantly increased in male <b>gym</b> <b>users.</b> However, no significant differences were observed in body image avoidance behaviors, though this is likely because of methodological limitations associated with psychometric measures selected. The study provides preliminary evidence that male <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> do experience subclinical eating and body image concerns, with some also experiencing clinically significant symptoms that could be precursors to the later development of an eating disorder. Results of the current study highlight the importance of educating key stakeholders within health and fitness centers, through community-based interventions, to increase awareness regarding male body image and eating disturbances...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, in a gym context we {{may find}} three people among ten who declare protein {{supplements}} consumption. Health, physical fitness, self esteem, performance and muscle hypertrophy are usually the main reasons inducing such kind of consumption. It well documented that particularly active individuals use supplements to build muscle, gain strength or prevent future diseases and illnesses. Furthermore, scientific researchers have shown that in general people have different opinions {{about the use of}} supplements and the appropriate food to eat. As reported by Bianco and colleagues in 2011, proteins are the most widely ingested supplements in people attending commercial <b>gyms</b> and supplement <b>users</b> also ate higher protein content foods in respect to those who did not supplement. It is clear that there is an increased interest in what is considered “proper” nutrition and what is the best nutritional strategy to optimize exercise training workouts. Dietary behaviour is in fact a complex phenomenon; food-based approaches are regarded as the long-term strategy for improving nutrition. These require significant efforts and appropriate planning in order to include certain specific macronutrients or supplements in everyday’s diet. Dieting or unhealthy eating practices, (such as eating foods deemed as “bad” by the dieter), in one way or another, may be associated with long-term weight gain. Previous studies have shown discrepant rates of supplement intake amongst subjects that exercise in gyms. These different findings might be explained by different gyms and people enrolled. Probably an under or over-reported use of such supplements, or an incorrect knowledge of what is considered a supplement may lead to such results. As mentioned before, proteins are the most widely consumed supplement in commercial gyms, although association of protein supplements and food consumption is a poorly researched field. It is to date unclear whether those more inclined to supplement also have healthier dietary patterns. As shown by Pechey and colleagues in 2010, socioeconomic status is another factor influencing the quality of food intake, highlighting that low socioeconomic status people usually purchase a greater proportion of unhealthy foods and beverages. Conversely, high socioeconomic status people purchase greater proportions of fibres, proteins and total sugars, and smaller proportions of sodium.

40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} research design, this paper addresses {{the practice of}} gym work in contemporary society by examining the factors that lead adult <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> {{to make the transition}} from non-gym activity to regular gym use. While there are many studies that address the motives for undertaking gym work, there are very few studies that take a temporal perspective by inviting <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> to explain why they resolved to do gym work when they did. Under the conceptual umbrella of life-course theory, this project interrogated 10 individual case studies with the aim of determining the catalyst for their involvement in gym work. The results showed that eight respondents cited critical incidents that drove them to undertake gym programmes. Two of the incidents - and consequent epiphanies and turning points - centred on serious illness and injuries, two arose out of a family trauma, three revolved around emotional distress and one case focused on bodily deterioration. Six of the eight respondents who cited critical incidents also noted that prior to the incident occurring they had little interest in using gyms as places for improving fitness and well-being. The results not only reveal that gyms are important spaces for transitioning people from sedentary to active lifestyles, but also confirm the utility of life-course frameworks in exposing the critical incidents, epiphanies and turning points that make it happe...|$|E

An online questionnaire was administered to assess BMI, body image, body esteem, perfectionism, and implicit and explicit anti-fat attitudes. Results showed high BMI was associated with greater weight dissatisfaction, regardless of gender or gym use. BMI was positively associated with body and appearance dissatisfaction, but only among non-gym users and females. Regular <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> displayed greater weight preoccupation, overall explicit AFA, and fear of weight gain, compared to non-gym users. Females reported higher appearance, body, and weight dissatisfaction, and lower overall explicit AFA, dislike of overweight individuals, and willpower, compared to males. Implicit and explicit AFA were weakly associated, except among females as implicit AFA significantly correlated with overall explicit AFA and fear of weight gain. A relationship was found between body image and explicit AFA. Specifically, high weight preoccupation correlated with greater overall explicit AFA, regardless of gender or gym use. Furthermore, high appearance and body dissatisfaction and greater weight preoccupation was associated with greater fear of weight gain. Regular <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> high in appearance investment displayed greater fear of weight gain, whereas non-gym users with greater investment in physical appearance reported greater dislike of overweight individuals. Greater weight preoccupation, body and weight dissatisfaction, and investment in physical appearance were associated with greater willpower among men, whereas only weight preoccupation correlated with willpower among women. Body image correlated with implicit AFA, but only among non-gym users and females, such that individuals with high body dissatisfaction and greater weight preoccupation displayed greater implicit AFA. No moderation or mediation effect was found for body esteem on the relationship between body image and AFA. However, perfectionism mediated the effect of body image on AFA. Specifically, maladaptive perfectionism mediated the relationship between Appearance Orientation and overall explicit AFA, Appearance Orientation and Dislike, Appearance Orientation and Fear, Overweight Preoccupation and overall explicit AFA, and Overweight Preoccupation and Fear.

Based on a thematic analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews it is argued that gym workout is a means to create better versions of the self on mainly three levels. First, gym participants perceive themselves to be efficient and productive in general. Second, gym training is believed to increase the control they have over their lives. Third, gym members associate their gym workout with amplified emotional resilience, believing that fitness workout makes them not only fitter in a physical sense but also fitter and better equipped in a psychological sense. Surprisingly, a small group of regular <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> displayed more critical sentiments and distanced themselves from the images and values the gym stands for.

However, the overall {{diversity of the}} bacterial community residing on the surfaces in these indoor environments is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the overall bacterial ecology of selected fitness centers in a metropolitan area (Memphis, TN, USA) utilizing culture-independent pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA genes. Samples were collected from the skin-contact surfaces (e. g., exercise instruments, floor mats, handrails, etc.) within fitness centers. Taxonomical composition revealed the abundance of Firmicutes phyla, followed by Proteobacter and Actinobacteria, {{with a total of}} 17 bacterial families and 25 bacterial genera. Most of these bacterial genera are of human and environmental origin (including, air, dust, soil, and water). Additionally, we found the presence of some pathogenic or potential pathogenic bacterial genera including Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, and Micrococcus. Staphylococcus was found to be the most prevalent genus. Presence of viable forms of these pathogens elevates risk of exposure of any susceptible individuals.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the social psychological determinants of the use of performance-enhancing drugs by <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> who practice bodybuilding, fitness, powerlifting or combat sports. In this questionnaire-based study, 144 respondents answered questions on their actual use and intention to use such drugs and also on their background characteristics and beliefs, such as their attitudes, social influences and self-efficacy. While all social psychological determinants correlated with intention to use these drugs, the most important predictors were personal norms, beliefs about performance outcomes and the perceived behavior of others. Non-users held more restrictive norms about using performance-enhancing drugs, were less optimistic about the performance-enhancing outcomes and believed that fewer significant others used performance-enhancing drugs than users and ex-users. The results of this study indicate that users attribute advantages to performance-enhancing drugs and are inclined to overlook the risks of using them.

40|$|Abstract: The {{recreational}} use of androgenic {{anabolic steroids}} (AAS) {{has been associated}} with a range of health and psychological problems in the past, but very little research has considered what impact AAS might have upon cognition and memory. The present study aimed to identify whether the recreational use of AAS is linked to deficits in everyday retrospective memory (RM) and everyday prospective memory (PM). We assessed self-reports of RM and PM in 25 regular AAS users and 28 Non-Users (all were males, regular <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> and aged between 18 - 30 years) using the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire. A Recreational Drug Use Questionnaire was used to measure AAS use and alcohol use. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale measuredtwo dimensions of mood (anxiety and depression). The results revealed thatrecreational AAS users reported significantly more everyday RM lapses (AAS Mean = 2. 41 vs Non-Users Mean = 1. 66; p< 0. 001) and significantly more everyday PM lapses (AAS Mean = 2. 79 vs Non-User Mean = 1. 84; p< 0. 001) than the Non-User group. These findings were not attributable to other substance use or mood variations. This is the first study to demonstrate everyday memory deficits associated with AAS use and it is suggested that such deficits be added to the growing list of health and cognitive problems associated with AAS use...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} analyze {{the validity of the}} relations hypothesized by the theory of self-determination in predicting adherence to physical exercise in fitness academy users and subjects following personal training. A total of 588 persons from Pelotas / RS / Brazil (405 <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> and 183 subjects following personal training) completed the Portuguese version of the three questionnaires, i. e. the Perceived Autonomy Support Climate Exercise Questionnaire, Basic Psychological Needs in the Exercise Scale and Behavioral Regulation in the Exercise Questionnaire − 2. The results support the factorial structure of the questionnaires used in this sample. There was a significant multivariate effect of context on self-determination for physical exercise training [Wilks’ λ = 0. 934, F (10, 576. 000) = 4. 03, p < 0. 001, η 2 = 0. 01]. The hypothesized structural equation model, which considered the self-determination theory, showed a good fit to the data (S-B χ 2 = 234. 703; p=. 001; df = 52; χ 2 /df = 4. 514; SRMS =. 049; NNFI =. 906; CFI =. 926; RMSEA =. 077; RMSEA 90 % CI =. 067 −. 088). However, in the comparative analysis, the perception of autonomy support, relatedness and competence were significantly higher in the context of personal training, while the amotivation and external regulation were significantly higher in the context of fitness academies...|$|E

40|$|Music {{and video}} are {{utilised}} by recreational <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> {{to enhance their}} exercise experience. Music and video have not been investigated for their combined ergogenic effect during high intensity exercise. To induce fatigue, this study was performed in warm (~ 26 °C), moist conditions (~ 50 %RH). Six, non-acclimated, male participants {{took part in the}} study. Each participant completed three 30 -minute exercise bouts on a motorised treadmill under three counterbalanced conditions on separate days: control (CON), motivational music plus video intervention (M), non-motivational intervention (NM). They completed a warm-up (5 km·h- 1 [5 minutes], 9 km·h- 1 [10 minutes]) followed by a maximal effort run (15 minutes). Participants did not receive any feedback of time elapsed, distance run or speed. Measures: Distance covered (metres), heart rate, blood lactate accumulation (Blac) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). Participants in the M condition ran significantly further than in the NM (M: 3524 [388]metres; NM: 3110 [561]metres; CON: 3273 [458]metres) and CON conditions, accumulated more Blac, but did not increase their peak RPE rating (p < 0. 05). The M intervention improved tolerance of high intensity exercise in warm conditions. It was proposed that a change in attentional processing from internal (physical sensations) to external perspective (music and video) may have facilitated this improvement. These findings have strong implications for improving health, fitness and engagement in gym-based exercise program...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} gym and non-gym users' use and understanding of nutrition labels. Design/methodology/approach – A consumer survey in the form of a questionnaire conducted in the Greater London area in February/March 2005. Subject recruitment process took place in both a gym and university setting. Frequency tables and ? 2 -test are used to assess relationships between variables (p= 0. 05). Findings – The resulting sample consisted of 187 subjects, with predominance of females and <b>gym</b> <b>users.</b> Of the subjects, 88 per cent reported to at least occasionally read nutrition labels, with higher reading rates amongst women, irrespective of gym user status. Total and saturated fats are the most often information viewed on labels, however the overall knowledge of the calorie content of fat is low, with 53 per cent of subjects responding saturated fat contains more calories per gram when compared with other types of fats. This paper does not find significant differences in the use and understanding of nutrition labels between gym and non-gym users, but highlights the publics' continued lack of understanding of nutrition labels. Originality/value – This paper is unique as it investigates whether there is any difference between gym/non-gym users' use and interpretation of use of nutrition labels. It finds gender impacted more on nutritional labels knowledge than gym user's status. This points to a gender issue and questions the quality of information available to the general public. This paper is valuable as it highlights and identifies an area that requires further research and assessment, and is therefore useful to key stakeholders responsible for public health nutrition. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Anabolic steroids (AS) {{abuse is}} {{spreading}} increasingly among professionals and amateur athletes {{taking part in}} gym halls. Healths educators' awareness of why athletes and <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> take such substances may help them to develop appropriate intervention. In this regard, perceived behavioral control (PBC) is defined as “a person’s estimate of how easy or difficult {{it will be for}} him or her to carry out the behavior”, and Self-efficacy (SE) is defined as “people’s beliefs about their capabilities to produce performances that influence events affecting their lives”. Both concepts refer to people's beliefs that they are capable of performing a given behavior. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the role of SE and PBC in predicting AS use among male body builders. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, totally three hundred male body builders in Hamadan were randomly selected. The data was gathered using a self-report questionnaire included: demographic characteristics, self-efficacy for not using AS, and PBC for not using AASs. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess association between SE and PBC with AASs use. Results: Based on the results, 24. 3 % (n= 73) of athletes reported that they had used AS and 38 % of them reported the history of using AS in the past. Logistic regression model showed SE (OR= 0. 851 P= 0. 000) and PBC (OR= 0. 711 & P= 0. 000) that indicate association between low PBC and Low SE to use AS. Conclusion: High self-efficacy for not using AS and high perceived behavioral control have effective potential to protect adolescents against high risk behaviors. Comprehensive preventative health education programs need to emphasize on psychological factors that mediate and predict adolescents’ and youths' health-related behaviors(Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2012; 19 (1) : 45 - 52...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{propose a}} {{self-control}} {{analysis of the}} role of availability in valuation. We explored the hypothesis that, when temptation becomes available, counteractive self-control processes render it less valuable. We found evidence for devaluation of available temptation among <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> before they choose to forgo an unhealthy snack rather than after they make their choice (Study 1), and among students evaluating leisure activities when their decision to enroll in an uninteresting class is reversible rather than irreversible (Study 2). Suppose you are on a diet, yet you have found yourself in a restaurant contemplating the dessert menu. You observe a dessert cart in the distance. Would the napoleon appear more pleasurable if it were in front of you, or would it seem better if it remained in the distance? Current theories of valuation do not provide an unequivocal answer. Making tempting stimuli available might increase valuation. Zajonc (1968) provided evidence for a positive association between availability and value: ‘‘The mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it’ ’ (p. 1; see also Bornstein, 1989; Harrison, 1977). Subsequently, research on goal pursuit (Shah & Kruglanski, 2002) showed that presentation of a means for goal pursuit implicitly activates the goal toward which the means is instrumental. Making a stimulus available would then activate any goals toward which the stimulus is instrumental. With the goals activated, the stimulus holds more utility, and so it becomes more valuable (Ferguson, 2007; Ferguson & Bargh, 2004). However, making temptations less available might also render the temptations more desirable. Reactance theory (J. W. Brehm, 1966; S. S. Brehm & Brehm, 1981) and commodity theory (Brock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Substances with {{performance}} enhancing properties {{appear on a}} continuum, ranging from prohibited performance enhancing drugs (PED) through dietary supplements to functional foods (FF). Anti-doping messages designed to dissuade athletes from using PEDs have been typically based on moralising sport competition and/or employing scare campaigns with focus on the negative consequences. Campaigns offering comparable and acceptable alternatives are nonexistent, nor are athletes helped in finding these for themselves. It is timely that social marketing strategies for anti-doping prevention and intervention incorporate media messages that complement the existing approaches by promoting comparable and acceptable alternatives to doping. To facilitate this process, {{the aim of this}} study was to ascertain whether a single exposure knowledge-based information intervention led to increased knowledge and subsequently result in changes in beliefs and automatic associations regarding performance enhancements. Methods In a repeated measure design, 115 male recreational <b>gym</b> <b>users</b> were recruited and provided with a brief information pamphlet on nitrite/nitrate and erythropoietin as a comparison. Measures of knowledge, beliefs and automatic associations were taken before and after the intervention with at least 24 hours between the two assessments. The psychological tests included explicit measures of beliefs and cognitive attitudes toward FF and PED using a self-reported questionnaire and computerised assessments of automatic associations using the modified and shortened version of the Implicit Association Test. Results The information based intervention significantly increased knowledge (p p p Conclusion Evidence was found that even a single exposure to a persuasive positive message can lead to belief change and can create new or alter existing associations - but only in the specific domain. Interventions to change outcome expectations in a positive way could be a rewarding avenue for anti-doping. Effective social marketing campaigns for drug free sport should follow appropriate market segmentation and use targeted messages via promoting the natural form as opposed to the purified form of the main active ingredient. </p...|$|E
