We designed a type of assistant positioning device for parallel <b>machine</b> <b>vice</b> to ensure complete positioning of work piece. The device can be easily and conveniently installed on the guide rail of a parallel <b>machine</b> <b>vice,</b> which keeps the generality of the <b>machine</b> <b>vice</b> and improves its performance. It features new structural design, easy to be processed, easy for use and optimized working efficiency and can be classified as a type of assistant positioning device of machine fixture with integral advantages economical efficiency and practicability...|$|R

Firstly, it has been discussed the concept of designing in general, then described the process of construction and the stages the process has gone through. In the designing process of a clamp, a <b>machine</b> <b>vice</b> respectively, has been included the morphological method of matrices.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of an optimal schedule for the so-called mixed shop problem when the makespan has to be minimized. In such a problem, some jobs have <b>fixed</b> <b>machine</b> orders (as in the job-shop), while {{the operations of the}} other jobs may be processed in arbitrary order (as in the open-shop). We prove binary NP-hardness of the preemptive problem with three machines and three jobs (two jobs have <b>fixed</b> <b>machine</b> orders and one may have an arbitrary machine order). We answer all other remaining open questions on the complexity status of mixed-shop problems with the makespan criterion by presenting different polynomial and pseudopolynomial algorithms...|$|R

The efficiency of a <b>fixed</b> geometry <b>machine</b> depends on the flow coefficient and Reynolds number.

Thus off-design operation is completely inefficient and may result in cavitation at higher flow rates.|$|R
