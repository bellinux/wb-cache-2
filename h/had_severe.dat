5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> scoliosis of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other.

Four of the five patients <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.|$|E

The trade was not {{finalized}} until December 18 due to the Padres expressing some concerns over a physical which revealed Kemp <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> arthritis in both hips. The Padres attempted to renegotiate the deal after the physical but the Dodgers refused, and the deal was consummated as originally conceived.|$|E

5|$|Only 13days after Eline {{struck the}} country, Cyclone Gloria also hit northeastern Madagascar, {{bringing}} additional damage and flooding. The two storms collectively {{killed at least}} 140people, although there was initial uncertainty in the toll due to disrupted communications. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. About 12,000people in 114villages were isolated. Rice fields were flooded for over a week, and coffee and banana crops <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> losses. Collectively, 12,230people were left without access to clean water.|$|E
5|$|Over land, the {{hurricane}} weakened to a tropical storm, although it re-intensified {{slightly in the}} Gulf of Mexico. On September25, it made a second landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and {{there were hundreds of}} deaths. About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> to total destruction to their roofs. The destruction prompted the declaration of martial law, and there was a curfew instated.|$|E

5|$|Reduction in flow {{caused by}} dams, diversions, water for {{thermoelectric}} power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs – {{the latter of}} which consumes more than 15percent of the river's natural runoff – has <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at {{only a fraction of}} its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{caused the}} deaths of 33 people: 32 tourists (17 of them were Swedes) and the occupant of the apartment above the book store. Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris. Thirteen people, who had jumped from windows, either died or were severely injured. Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> injuries. Two guests from the United States escaped without injury.|$|E
5|$|When I Airborne Corps was {{committed}} to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning's rift with Brereton <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> repercussions. Browning {{was concerned about the}} timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, and not to make two drops on the first day. This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen.|$|E

5|$|In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union {{experienced}} the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the two superpowers {{to the edge}} of nuclear war and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated rapprochement. After years of dormant or lethargic negotiations, American and British negotiators subsequently forged a strong working relationship and with Soviet negotiators found common ground on test restrictions later in 1962. After years of pursuing a comprehensive ban, Khrushchev was convinced to accept a partial ban, partly due to the efforts of Soviet nuclear scientists, including Kurchatov, Sakharov, and Yulii Borisovich Khariton, who argued that atmospheric testing <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> consequences for human health. Khrushchev had been concerned by a partial ban due to the greater US experience in underground tests; by 1962, the US had conducted 89 such tests and the Soviet Union just two (the Soviet focus had been on cheaper, larger-yield atmospheric tests). For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a partial ban would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities. Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered. Her bedlinen was changed daily, and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates. She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery. Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s, she <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train haulage contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, {{a new report}} from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, and was not performing safety analysis. Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt that the issues taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none of the procedures criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E

5|$|Racer's {{hurricane}} was {{a destructive}} tropical cyclone that <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> effects on northeastern Mexico and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October1837. It takes {{its name from}} the Royal Navy ship Racer, which sustained some damage when it encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September26 and27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October1. As the hurricane approached northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply eastward. The storm battered the GulfCoast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October3 and7, and after crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas. For most of the storm's duration, the strongest winds and heaviest rains were confined to the northern side of its track.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) {{began on}} January 24, 1848, when gold {{was found by}} James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California {{from the rest of}} the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of {{immigration}} and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes <b>had</b> <b>severe</b> side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
