2500|$|<b>Data</b> <b>scientist</b> Azhar Hamdan, {{working to}} explain the paradoxes the 2016 outcome, [...] "chief among them the {{discrepancy}} between the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by 2.8 million votes, and the electoral college, where Trump won 304-227", compared Trump's 30 states against Clinton's 20 states and the District of Columbia. He said that Trump outperformed Mitt Romney's 2012 results, while Clinton only just matched Barack Obama's 2012 totals. Hamdan also said that Trump was [...] "the highest vote earner of any Republican candidate ever," [...] exceeding George W. Bush's 62.04 million votes in 2004, though neither reached Clinton's 65.9 million, nor Obama's 69.5 million votes in 2008, the overall record. He concluded, with help from The Cook Political Report, that the election hinged not on Clinton's large 2.8 million overall vote margin over Trump, but rather on about 78,000 votes from only three counties in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.|$|E

40|$|In larger organizations, {{multiple}} {{teams of}} <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> have to integrate data from heterogeneous data sources as preparation for data analysis tasks. Writing effective analytical queries requires <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> to have in-depth {{knowledge of the}} existence, semantics, and usage context of data sources. Once gathered, such knowledge is informally shared within a specific team of <b>data</b> <b>scientists,</b> but usually is neither formalized nor shared with other teams. Potential synergies remain unused. We therefore introduce a novel approach which extends data management systems with additional knowledge-sharing capabilities to facilitate user collaboration without altering established data analysis workflows. Relevant collective knowledge from the query log is extracted to support data source discovery and incremental data integration. Extracted knowledge is formalized and provided at query time.

40|$|Feature {{engineering}} {{is one of}} the most important and time consuming tasks in predictive analytics projects. It involves understanding domain knowledge and data exploration to discover relevant hand-crafted features from raw data. In this paper, we introduce a system called One Button Machine, or OneBM for short, which automates feature discovery in relational databases. OneBM automatically performs a key activity of <b>data</b> <b>scientists,</b> namely, joining of database tables and applying advanced data transformations to extract useful features from data. We validated OneBM in Kaggle competitions in which OneBM achieved performance as good as top 16 % to 24 % <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> in three Kaggle competitions. More importantly, OneBM outperformed the state-of-the-art system in a Kaggle competition in terms of prediction accuracy and ranking on Kaggle leaderboard. The results show that OneBM can be useful for both <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> and non-experts. It helps <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> reduce <b>data</b> exploration time allowing them to try and error many ideas in short time. On the other hand, it enables non-experts, who are not familiar with data science, to quickly extract value from their data with a little effort, time and cost...|$|R
