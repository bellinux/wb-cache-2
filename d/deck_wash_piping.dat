5000|$|One folk {{tale that}} {{continues}} {{in the culture of}} Northern Bay and the surrounding communities is that of [...] "Hannah's Tolt". The following is from the old Newfoundland magazine <b>Decks</b> <b>Wash</b> (V.9, No.6, Dec.1980): ...|$|R
50|$|At ‘four bells’ she {{was struck}} by a big angry sea,She listed right over; her <b>decks</b> <b>washed</b> a-lea.She was {{crippled}} — and signalled for help to the shore,But ere it arrived the ship was no more.|$|R
50|$|Her carbonfiber {{design has}} a very high power-to-weight ratio, she is rigged with a carbonfiber {{rotating}} mast and has a canting keel. Due to the unprecedented performance of the boat when built, the design includes several safety features including crash bars and a high deck sides to reduce high-speed <b>deck</b> <b>wash.</b> She can function without any auxiliary power.|$|R
60|$|The {{deepwater}} sailor of to-day needs know none {{of these}} things. And he doesn't. He pulls and hauls as he is ordered, swabs <b>decks,</b> <b>washes</b> paint, and chips iron-rust. He knows nothing, and cares less. Put him in a small boat and he is helpless. He will cut an even better figure on the hurricane deck of a horse.|$|R
50|$|Luna is {{equipped}} with various pumps, including a fuel transfer pump, to shift fuel from one fuel tank to another and to a day tank, a bilge and salvage pump, to pump water from the tug and from barges and ships {{in case of an}} emergency, and a fire pump to deliver water to several hydrants for fire-fighting and <b>deck</b> <b>washing.</b> Galley water is delivered by hand pump.|$|R
60|$|The <b>deck,</b> <b>washed</b> {{now almost}} {{continuously}} by hurtling tons of storm-mad water, as one mountainous wave followed another {{the length of}} the ship, had become entirely impossible. With difficulty the men were attempting to get below between waves. All semblance of discipline had vanished. For the most part they were a pack of howling, cursing, terror-ridden beasts, fighting at the hatches with those who would have held them closed against the danger of each new assault of the sea.|$|R
60|$|Day broke, just as {{the last}} batch of men were brought on board. As soon as these had gone below the whistle was sounded, the old crew came up on deck, and the {{preparations}} for making sail commenced. The anchor was hove short, the lashings of the sails were loosened, the flags run up to the mast heads, the last casks and bales lowered into the hold, the hatches put on, and the <b>decks</b> <b>washed</b> down.|$|R
60|$|I was stunned. I {{felt like}} {{one in a}} horrid dream. Gradually the smoke cleared away, and then I saw that our captain had put down the helm and our vessel was {{sheering}} off to leeward under full sail. The rapidity with which everything was done quite took away my breath. Before {{we were out of}} gun-shot the decks had been cleared, the dead thrown into the sea, the wounded carried below, and the <b>decks</b> <b>washed</b> with buckets of water.|$|R
60|$|The {{second day}} out of port, the <b>decks</b> being <b>washed</b> down and breakfast over, the watch was called, and the mate set us to work.|$|R
60|$|The night {{got very}} dark, for the land-breeze brought off a haze, but the engine lamp and {{glow from the}} furnace door threw an elusive glimmer about the craft. White sea-crests chased and caught her up, and rolling forward broke between the funnel and the bows. Water splashed on board, the engine hissed as the spray fell on it, and the {{floorings}} got wet. One could see the foam on <b>deck</b> <b>wash</b> about the headledge forward as the bows went up with a sluggishness that was the consequence of carrying an extra load of coal.|$|R
60|$|We soon {{reached the}} {{schooner}} and found ourselves the last aboard. In {{a few minutes}} the seals were skinned, boats and <b>decks</b> <b>washed,</b> and we were down below by the roaring fo'castle fire, with a wash, change of clothes, and a hot, substantial supper before us. Sail had been put on the schooner, as we had a run of seventy-five miles to make to the southward before morning, so as to get {{in the midst of the}} seals, out of which we had strayed during the last two days' hunting.|$|R
6000|$|The usual prompt [...] "Ay, ay, sir," [...] was given, {{but before}} the men could reach their places a heavy sea struck the vessel amidships, poured several tons {{of water on the}} <b>decks,</b> and <b>washed</b> all the loose gear overboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--my wife an' little gurl, {{two women}} and an old gentleman. You don't suppose I'd keep 'em on <b>deck</b> to be <b>washed</b> overboard?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{took some}} hours' work before the <b>deck</b> was <b>washed,</b> the ropes coiled down, and {{everything}} ship-shape. By the time all was done, the low coast of Norfolk had sunk below the horizon, and the smack was far out at sea. There was more motion now, {{but the wind}} was still light.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} {{looked down to}} tell you," [...] he said cheerfully, [...] "that {{everything}} is going on well. The first burst of these gales is always the critical point, and we can congratulate ourselves that we have got through it without losing a spar or sail--thanks to our having had sufficient warning to get all snug, and to the gale striking us gradually. I am afraid you won't have a very comfortable time of it {{for the next day}} or two; but there is nothing to be at all uneasy about. The gale is off the land, and we have sea-room enough for anything. Now we have got rid of half our cargo the ship is in her very best trim, and though we may get her <b>decks</b> <b>washed</b> a bit by and by, she will be none the worse for that." ...|$|R
60|$|The watch {{finished}} <b>washing</b> <b>decks.</b> I went {{below and}} stopped at Mr. Burns' door (he {{could not bear to}} have it shut), but hesitated to speak to him till he moved his eyes. I gave him the news.|$|R
500|$|In 1893 {{the pier}} head was {{replaced}} in cast iron {{with a new}} timber landing stage, and the pier head pavilion was completed in 1894. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. In 1899, [...] of the <b>decking</b> was <b>washed</b> away by a storm, and in 1910, part of the landing stage was damaged in another storm and replaced by a concrete landing stage in 1913.|$|R
60|$|It was now {{late in the}} afternoon; and for {{the present}} bent upon {{avoiding}} land, and gaining the shoreless sea, never mind where, Samoa again forced round his craft before the wind, leaving the island astern. The decks were still cumbered with {{the bodies of the}} Lahineese, which heel to point and crosswise, had, log-like, been piled up on the main-hatch. These, one by one, were committed to the sea; after which, the <b>decks</b> were <b>washed</b> down.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the final}} phase of those exercises, Tusk was {{operating}} in a unit which also included the submarine [...] On 25 August, while steaming through a gale off the coast of Norway, Cochino suffered an explosion in one of her batteries. Tusk rushed to the aid of the stricken submarine, providing medical supplies for Cochinos injured by way of life rafts. One such raft capsized in heavy seas sending a Cochino officer and a civilian employee of the Bureau of Ships into the icy Arctic Sea. Both were recovered, but during the administration of artificial respiration on board Tusk, another wave broke over her <b>deck</b> <b>washing</b> away the civilian and 11 Tusk crewmen. Only four sailors were subsequently rescued. After those tragic events, Tusk and the limping Cochino headed for Hammerfest, Norway. Along the way, another explosion erupted in Cochinos after battery. The second detonation sealed Cochinos fate. Water poured through her battered hull. Tusk came alongside in heavy seas and lashed herself to the sinking submarine. Under the worst possible conditions, Tusk took all of Cochinos crew off safely. Minutes later Cochino took her final plunge and Tusk headed for Hammerfest.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 {{the pier}} head was {{replaced}} in cast iron {{with a new}} timber landing stage, and the pier head pavilion was completed in 1894. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. In 1899, 20 ft of the <b>decking</b> was <b>washed</b> away by a storm, and in 1910, part of the landing stage was damaged in another storm and replaced by a concrete landing stage in 1913.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. (Captain) Jacobs {{was calm}} and self-possessed. He even behaved excellently. Once, all on <b>deck</b> were <b>washed</b> into the lee scuppers, {{and one man}} washed overboard; but he held a rope, and with it and the recoil was borne in again upon the deck. Lowest barometer, 28° 65'! We were startled {{yesterday}} at about 4 P.M. with {{the news of the}} reappearance of the vessel. I think that some £30 and the replacing the boats will pay damages, but one doesn't think of that.|$|R
50|$|Secondary spill {{containment}} is {{the containment}} of hazardous liquids {{in order to}} prevent pollution of soil and water. Common techniques include the use of spill berms to contain oil-filled equipment, fuel tanks, truck <b>washing</b> <b>decks,</b> or any other places or items that may leak hazardous liquids.|$|R
60|$|The <b>decks</b> were <b>washed</b> down, {{the main}} hatch removed, and a gun-tackle {{purchase}} rigged before the boat arrived with breakfast. I {{had grown so}} suspicious of the wreck, {{that it was a}} positive relief to me to look down into the hold, and see it full, or nearly full, of undeniable rice packed in the Chinese fashion in boluses of matting. Breakfast over, Johnson and the hands turned to upon the cargo; while Nares and I, having smashed open the skylight and rigged up a windsail on deck, began the work of rummaging the cabins.|$|R
60|$|Martin was too {{far gone}} in the {{lassitude}} of sea-sickness to make any reply to these words, or even to attend to them as they were spoken. And the subject of their discourse returning at this crisis with some hot tea, effectually {{put a stop to}} any resumption of the theme by Mr Tapley; who, when the meal was over and he had adjusted Martin's bed, went up on <b>deck</b> to <b>wash</b> the breakfast service, which consisted of two half-pint tin mugs, and a shaving-pot of the same metal.|$|R
50|$|Three main {{factors were}} {{attributed}} to the sinking of London by the subsequent enquiry by the Board of Trade: firstly, the decision by Captain Martin to return to Plymouth, as it is believed the ship had passed {{the worst of the}} weather conditions and by turning back the London re-entered the storm; secondly, the ship was overloaded with 345 tons of railway iron; and finally, the 50 tons of coal which was stored above deck, which after the <b>decks</b> were <b>washed</b> by waves blocked the scupper holes, which prevented drainage of the seawater.|$|R
60|$|At daylight, {{all hands}} were called, and the <b>decks</b> were <b>washed</b> down; {{then we had}} an hour to go ashore to breakfast; after which we worked at the rigging, or picked oakum, or were set to some {{employment}} or other, never mind how trivial, till twelve o'clock, {{when we went to}} dinner. At half-past nine we resumed work; and finally knocked of at four o'clock in the afternoon, unless something particular was in hand. And after four o'clock, we could go where we pleased, and were not required to be on board again till next morning at daylight.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} crew <b>washing</b> <b>decks</b> above me. I knew I {{would have been}} told at once {{if there had been}} any wind. Calm, I thought, and I was doubly vexed. Indeed, I felt dual more than ever. The steward reappeared {{suddenly}} in the doorway. I jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave a start.|$|R
25|$|By 2:15a.m., Lightoller, Moody {{and others}} were {{struggling}} to retrieve Collapsible Boats A and B from their places of storage {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters. They rigged up makeshift ramps from oars and spars down which they slid the boats onto the Boat Deck. Unfortunately for all concerned, the boat broke through the ramp and landed upside-down on the deck. It reached the Boat Deck upside-down but there was no time to right it as Titanic began her final break-up and plunge to the seabed. Water swept across the Boat <b>Deck,</b> <b>washing</b> the upside-down lifeboat and many people into the sea. Wireless operator Harold Bride found himself trapped underneath the overturned hull. Titanics increasing angle in the water and an opening expansion joint caused the stays supporting the forward funnel to snap and crash into the water, crushing swimmers in its path and pushing Collapsible B away from the sinking ship. As Titanic went under, the lifeboat was left in the midst of hundreds of people swimming in the water. Several dozen people climbed onto its hull, including Lightoller, who then took charge of it. Also aboard were Jack Thayer (whose mother was saved with her maid in Boat #4, but whose father died), military historian Colonel Archibald Gracie, who later wrote a popular account of the disaster, and Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Bride managed to escape from the air pocket beneath the boat and made it onto the hull.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go then, lad," [...] the man said. [...] "I {{have always}} thought that you have borne up very well; but I know it is even worse for you {{than it is for}} us sailors. We are {{accustomed}} to be cooped up for six months at a time on board a ship, without any news from outside; with nothing to do save to see that the <b>decks</b> are <b>washed,</b> and the brasses polished, except when there is a shift of wind or a gale. But to anyone like yourself, I can understand that it must be terrible; and if you feel getting into that state, I should say go by all means." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the <b>decks</b> were <b>washed</b> and the little {{schooner}} was once more presentable that the mate gave a thought to his own toilet. It was a fine, warm morning in May, and some of the cargo had got into his hair and settled in streaks on his hot, good-humored face. The boy had brought aft a wooden bucket filled with fair water, and placed upon the hatch by its side a piece of yellow soap and a towel. Upon these preparations the mate smiled pleasantly, and throwing off his shirt and girding his loins with his braces, he bent over and with much zestful splashing began his ablutions.|$|R
60|$|She was rusty and dingy; {{the screens}} along her bridge were cracked and burned by the sun. The boat at her rail was {{blackened}} by soot, {{and when she}} rolled the weed streamed down from her water-line. She looked very small and overloaded by the stack of coal on <b>deck.</b> The <b>wash</b> round her stern got whiter, ripples ran back from her bows, and when she steamed near Cartwright's boat, her whistle shrieked. Cartwright stood up and waved; Learmont, on the bridge, touched his cap, but {{for a few moments}} Barbara fixed her eyes on Terrier's deckhouse. Then she blushed and her heart beat, for she saw Lister {{at the door of the}} engine-room. He saw her and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I shipped on a seal {{schooner}} {{with the}} lazy Siwashes, and followed his trackless {{trail to the}} north where the hunt was then warm. And we were away weary months, and spoke many of the fleet, and heard much of the wild doings of him I sought; but never once did we raise him above the sea. We went north, even to the Pribilofs, and killed the seals in herds on the beach, and brought their warm bodies aboard till our scuppers ran grease and blood and no man could stand upon the deck. Then were we chased by a ship of slow steam, which fired upon us with great guns. But we put sail till the sea was over our <b>decks</b> and <b>washed</b> them clean, and lost ourselves in a fog.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the ship}} began its final plunge, the water came {{up onto the}} boat <b>deck</b> and <b>washed</b> over the bridge. Lightoller {{attempted}} to launch Collapsible B on the port side. This collapsible boat {{was one of the}} smaller Englehardt lifeboats with canvas sides and was stowed atop the officers' quarters. The collapsible floated off the deck upside down. Lightoller then crossed over to the starboard side of the roof, [...] "to see if there was anything further to be done there". As the ship sank, seawater washed over the entire bow, producing a large wave that rolled aft along the boat deck. Seeing crowds of people run away from the rising water, Lightoller decided that he could do no more and dived into the water from the roof of the officers' quarters.|$|R
5000|$|Huáscar again fired guns at {{such close}} range that they killed several crew members {{including}} engineers and firemen who {{went up on}} <b>deck</b> and <b>washed</b> away the officers' mess room, which was then also the ship's clinic. Sublieutenant Ignacio Serrano cried again [...] "Stand by for boarding!" [...] and he boarded Huáscar with eleven more men, armed with machetes and rifles but they were again unsuccessful, falling {{on the deck of}} the monitor to the Gatling guns and the monitor's crew, some dying immediately due to bullet wounds sustained. Ignacio Serrano was then the only survivor and had received several shot wounds in the groin. Grau quickly had him picked up and carried to the infirmary in a state of shock, where they left him next to the dying petty officer Aldea.|$|R
60|$|Moran {{turned to}} Bethune, who was leaning as if {{exhausted}} on his helm, and demanded {{why he had}} not luffed the craft, which would have eased their work. Then the dripping man showed them that the boat they carried on <b>deck</b> had been <b>washed</b> against the wheel {{so that he could}} not pull the spokes round. They moved her, and when Bethune regained control of the sloop, he told them what had happened, in disjointed gasps.|$|R
