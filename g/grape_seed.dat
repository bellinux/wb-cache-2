40|$|Abstract: <b>Grape</b> {{skin and}} <b>seeds</b> are sources for {{phenolic}} compounds {{that contribute to}} the sensory characteristics and beneficial bioactive of many processed foods. Hence, the study was aimed to evaluate and characterize the phenolic composition and evaluate the antioxidant activities of three grape varieties skin (white, red and black) and white <b>grape</b> <b>seeds.</b> The results indicated that among the grape skin of the three varieties, black grape skin (BGS) contained the highest amount of total phenolic compounds (2070. 02 mg GAE/ 100 g dry weight). While white grape skin (WGS) found to have the lowest phenolic contents (296. 27 mg GAE/ 100 g). On the other hand, white <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> (WG Seeds) contained the highest content of phenolic compounds compared to the skin samples (2536. 5 mgGAE/ 100 g dry weight). The phenolic composition of the grape skin and <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> samples were determined by HPLC. The main phenolic compound in the three grape skins was Di-OH-cinamic acid. In the contrast, the main phenolic compounds in the <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> were Catechin and Brocyanidin B 1. Besides, all the extracts showed remarkable DPPH radical scavenging activities with EC 50 values ranged from 0. 26 - 26. 91 µg extract/µg DPPH. The results showed that scavenging capacity of black grape skin and <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> extracts increased with increasing concentration of the skin extract in the range 0 – 21. 08 µg extract/µg DPPH and <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> extract up to 1. 92 µg extract/µg DPPH.

2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). <b>Grape</b> <b>seed</b> extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

The experiment was conducted in two experimental periods and in each period 100 laying hens were surveyed. They were separated into two groups an experimental and a control one.
