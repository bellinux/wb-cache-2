We sketch the semantic search techniques in RFT and illustrate a prototype tailored to the fishing industry. 1 Aim and Scope In this paper we introduce the system Real Food Trade (RFT), which provides a marketplace for any food producer to sell their produce directly, freeing the producer both from the wholesaler and from the effort of retail. The main {{idea is that the}} producer uses the system to advertise flash stands, each of which consists of (1) a set of products, with their quantities, and (2) a delivery time and location. From the economic point of view, this is important as severa...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of the wood flows from smallholder plantations to industrial buyers in the Binh Dinh and Phu Tho provinces of Vietnam. It describes the actors involved in the market chains, their respective roles, the value added to the wood in the market chain and the distribution of costs and benefits. Various differences between the two provinces exist. In Binh Dinh, wood flows are relatively direct and the market price information is transparent. There are various end-buyers but most are buying bark-clean logs. The division of labour is clear among actors. Plantation wood brings substantial income for the tree growers, yet there is great potential to improve their income through better marketing. In the Phu Tho province, the situation is more complex with various levels of intermediaries. The most striking difference is that most actors have poor access to price information, even in the wholesale market. Markets are more varied with four main types of wood; the most prominent are woodchips and bark-clean logs. The <b>end-buyer</b> market of these products is dominated by Bai Bang Paper Mill because it is located close to the tree growers. At site level, the division of labour is not as clear as in Binh Dinh. The farm gate price in Phu Tho is much lower than the price in Binh Dinh, thus tree growers in Phu Tho have a lower income from wood sales. Plantation wood plays an important part in local livelihoods, but there is still room for improvement...|$|E

"May 2011 "This study explores the conditions for the possibility of an effective participation of small vegetable farmers in the modern value chains and the effects of this participation on the farmers' livelihood sustainability. Taking a confluence of ideas from the literatures on value chains, clustering, and sustainable livelihoods, it examines how market relationships could be shaped through structures of producer-buyer reciprocity and horizontal cooperation among farmers that could mediate impacts on farmer households. Markets constantly evolve and may thus be re-engineered to favor relationships that potentially benefit both the upstream vegetable producers as well as the downstream <b>end-buyers.</b> Based on an examination of the processual dynamics engaged in by the small farmers in supplying a fast-food company with assistance from external agencies, I generate a number of generalized observations about the possible conditions through which participation in the modern value chains improves the prospects of livelihood sustainability of the small farmers. I argue that attaining sustainable livelihoods through participation in modern value chains is challenging and difficult, involving a continuous and arduous process of innovative learning on the part of small farmers and an unremitting assurance {{from the side of the}} <b>end-buyers</b> to integrate small producers in their supply chain. The role of external development agencies proves critical in establishing the reciprocal and redistributive patterns of relationships between producers and buyers. In the final analysis, a value chain vision of external interventions helps facilitate the inclusion of small farmers in the modern markets and promotes their competitive advantage in the long run...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a decentralized auction-based approach to pricing of edge-allocated bandwidth in a differentiated services Internet. The players in our network economy model are one raw-capacity seller per network, one broker per service per network, and users, {{to play the}} roles of whole-sellers, retailers, and <b>end-buyers,</b> respectively, in a two-tier wholeseller/retailer market, which is best interpreted as a “sender-pay ” model. With the progressive second price auction mechanism as the basic building block, we conduct a game theoretic analysis, deriving optimal strategies for buyers and brokers, and show the existence of networkwide market equilibria. In addition to pricing, another key consideration in building differentiated network services is the feasibility of maintaining stable and consistent service level agreements across multiple networks where demand-driven dynamic allocations are made only at the edges. Based on the proposed game-theoretic model, {{we are able to}} construct an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the game, which determines the sustainability of any set of service level agreement configurations between Internet service providers. These analytical results are validated with simulations of user and broker dynamics, using the distributed progressive second price auction as the spot market mechanism in a scenario with three interconnected networks, and two services based on the proposed standard expedited forwarding and assured forwarding per-hop behaviors.

50|$|The Lebanese GDP {{per capita}} is around US$13,000 (after taxes) while the Lebanese working abroad make on average around $30,000 /year (after taxes). A decent housing {{situation}} {{far away from}} Beirut can cost around $150,000, a decent housing {{in the suburbs of}} Beirut can easily cost 4 times that amount, while decent housing in the Beirut Central District could cost millions. Since home prices are rising constantly, many Lebanese and other investors are buying (through a mortgage) houses in order to resell them later (to other potential investors) at inflated prices. This strategy, as well as other deceptive strategies by the real estate agents left many Lebanese, both inside and outside Lebanon, unable to buy property in Lebanon anymore. Additionally, the inflated home prices are leading to an increase in rental prices, further increasing inflation and decreasing the real income of the Lebanese living in Lebanon. Other Lebanese who are <b>end-buyers</b> (e.g. not thinking of reselling their home) are committing to long term and risky loans in order to repay their mortgage. Since the banks only give 60% of the price of the house, the banking system in Lebanon can sustain a decrease of 40% of home prices in case of a bubble burst, this will increase the effect of the bubble burst on the buyer, as sometimes the 40% can constitute one's life savings (as well as his family's).|$|R
