The durability of coating in terms of corrosion resistance {{is the focus of}} this paper. The detailed degradation mechanism has been investigated using electrochemical-monitoring techniques supported by precise pre-test and post-test microscopical examination using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Zn-Al-Mg-RE coating shows a typical aspect of layered heterogeneous structure, the existing of ZnAl 2 O 4 and MgAl 2 O 4 implies the good anti-corrosion feature. The polarization curves showed that Zn-Al-Mg-RE coating exhibits passive behavior at 0. 5 h and 16 h immersion, but at 600 h, it begins to dissolute. In contrast, the anti-corrosion performance isn’t cut down. The corrosion potential moves to the noble direction step by step, along with the current density drops gradually. After corrosion, it has been observed that the coating surface is jointed by <b>flaky</b> <b>lamellar</b> products and dense without obvious defects and pores. It is postulated that with the addition of RE, the porosity of the coating is reduced, meanwhile, the stability of the products layer can reinforce the self-sealing effect of the coating distinctively...|$|R

30|$|The {{ultrasonic}} vibrations {{are transferred}} into an elastic environment by spreading the longitudinal or transverse waves. Transverse waves cannot propagate in a gas or a liquid {{because there is}} no mechanism for driving the motion perpendicular to the propagation of the wave; thus, they are transformed into standing (stationary) waves by the ultrasonic horn. Stationary waves are able to vibrate <b>lamellar</b> <b>particles,</b> using the vibration to overcome van der Waals forces. As a result, <b>lamellar</b> <b>particles</b> are gradually peeled off to reveal individual sheets. The particle milling effect is based on intense ultrasonic cavitation, while delamination is caused by stationary waves. Increasing the density of the solvent or/and increasing the pressure of the solvent will also increase the cavitation threshold [24, 25]. Through the selection of suitable reaction conditions and factors (sonotrode shape, intensity of ultrasound, solvent density, pressure, etc.), it is then possible to favor the process of delamination over grinding and milling. Delamination of layered minerals [26] by ultrasound was successfully used for the preparation of exfoliated mica [27] and kaoline [28] under atmospheric pressure. Pressurized batch ultrasonic reactors were also used to exfoliate graphite to graphene [29], which then served as the precursor for the composite materials of graphene-anatase [30] and graphene oxide-anatase [31]. It can then be theorized that the exfoliation of IAGs using power ultrasound in an environment of strong polar aprotic solvents in a pressurized batch reactor could be achieved through this procedure.|$|R

The formate-LDH is sensitive to the atmospheric humidity and reversibly exchanges its intercalated water with atmospheric moisture. The hydration/dehydration cycle is complete within a narrow range of 0 - 30 relative humidity with significant hysteresis and involves a randomly interstratified intermediate phase.

For this purpose, {{the fact that}} two polymers are both crystalline makes situation much complicated. To simplify, we used non-crystalline PLA: poly(d,l-lactide) (DLPLA), which is a racemic copolymer comprising d- and l-lactide moieties. Higher-order peaks arising from the ordered lamellar stacking of PEG (i. e. the lattice peaks) were observed in the various blend samples, {{as well as in the}} PEG 100 % sample, all of which were cast from their solutions in dichloromethane.

Here, we combined these studies with a new technique enabling the simultaneous and non-invasive measurement of surface tension (γ). This method is a refinement of the pendant-drop principle. A sapphire cone with a 300 -μm aperture keeps the experimental fluid by virtue of surface coherence in a fixed and nearly planar position above the objective of an inverted microscope. The radius of curvature of the fluid meniscus is related to γ and determines the pattern of light back-reflection upon epi-illumination. This method, which we name “inverted interface”, has several novel aspects, in particular its microscopic dimensions. When using <b>lamellar</b> body-like <b>particles</b> freshly released by alveolar type II cells, we found that their conversion at the interface resulted in γ-reduction close to 30 mN/m. After a fast initial decay, γ-decrease proceeded slowly and in proportion to single particle conversions.

The coarse aggregate produced shows high percentage of cubic materials (64 %) and 36 % elongated / lamellar material.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe effect of friction-stir processing (FSP) on the microstructure of a cast nickel-aluminum bronze (NAB) material {{has been characterized}} by various micro-analytical methods including orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). Cast NAB is widely utilized {{in the production of}} propellers for the surface ships and submarines of the U. S. Navy due to excellent corrosion-resistance. New applications require improved mechanical properties that may be attainable using FSP to achieve localized microstructure modification. Friction between a rotating tool and the surface of the material results in a *stirring* action that, in turn, produces adiabatic heating and local softening of the material. The tool rotation results in very large shear deformations in the softened regions and thus microstructure refinement and homogenization; in effect FSP may convert an as-cast microstructure to a wrought condition in the absence of macroscopic shape change. In as-cast material, results of optical and scanning electron microscopy (using energy dispersive analysis) show an ` (FCC) matrix containing globular and particulate dispersions that correspond to the *I, *II and *IV second phases; these represent various morphologies of the Fe 3 Al intermetallic compound, which has a D 03 structure. Also present are <b>lamellar</b> <b>particles</b> of *III, which is NiAl and has a B 2 structure. The grain size in the ` matrix is ~ 1 mm. In OIM, the microtexture and microstructure in the ` (FCC) matrix may be readily obtained and analyzed. However, interatom distances in the Fe 3 Al and NiAl phases differ by only about one percent and so these phases are not distinguishable from one another during OIM. Altogether, microstructure and microtexture analysis showed that there are several regions in the thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) of a material subjected to FSP. From base material inward toward the TMAZ, these include: annealing effects in undeformed base material; a region just inside the TMAZ in which grain deformation and C-type shear deformation textures are observed; regions of highly refined and recrystallized grains further inside the TMAZ, wherein the grain size is < 5 æm; and, finally, regions of elongated, banded and twinned grain structures that suggest grain growth following recrystalliztion.

The addition of both organic and inorganic fillers in a CS:PVA blend polymer enhances the thermal and ionic properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solution. The work was divided into two parts. In the first part the effects of different counterions on phase behavior was investigated, while the second part concerns the 1 -monooleoyl-rac-glycerol (MO) /n-octyl-β-D-glucoside (OG) / 2 H 2 O-system. The effects of mixing monovalent and divalent counterions were studied for two surfactant systems, sodium/calcium octyl sulfate, and piperidine/piperazine octanesulfonate. It was found that mixing monovalent and divalent counterions resulted in a large decrease in cmc already at very low fractions of the divalent counterion. Moreover, the degree of counterion binding for piperidine in the piperidine/piperazine octanesulfonate system was much higher than predicted, {{probably due to the}} larger hydrophobic moiety of piperidine. The effects of hydrophobic counterions were studied for eight alkylpyridinium octanesulfonates (APOS). The results were discussed in terms of packing constraints. The anomalous behavior of the 2 H 2 O quadrupolar splittings in the lamellar phases was explained by the presence of two or more binding sites at the lamellae surface. The MO/OG/water system was studied in general and the MO-rich cubic phases in particular. When mixing MO and OG it was found that OG-rich structures (micelles, hexagonal and cubic phase of space group Ia 3 d) could solubilize quite large amounts of MO, while the MO-rich cubic structures where considerable less tolerant towards the addition of OG. The micelles in the OG-rich L 1 phase were found to remain rather small and discrete in the larger part of the L 1 phase area, but at low water concentration and high MO content a bicontinuous structure was indicated. Only small fractions of OG was necessary to convert the MO-rich cubic Pn 3 m structure to an Ia 3 d structure, and upon further addition of OG a lamellar (La) phase formed. Since the larger part of the phase diagram contains a lamellar structure (present either as a single La phase or as a dispersion of <b>lamellar</b> <b>particles</b> together with other phases), the conclusion was that introducing OG in the MO structures, forces the MO bilayer to become more flat.

It is shown that the density of PEG-lipid in the membrane, sufficient to prevent liposome aggregation and subsequent phase transition, depends on the size of the PEG headgroup.

During sintering the degree of texture increases due to the preferential growth of pressing-oriented particles at the expense of non-oriented ones. As a result, an easy magnetization axis formed in the sintered ferrite which coincides with the compression axis. Most sizes of ferrite products are manufactured {{in such a way that}} the magnetic field lines in their operation do not coincide with the compression axis (ring, P- and R-core), which significantly reduces their operating parameters. To reduce the texture in this study we used a short process flow diagram including only one heat treatment i. e. sintering of the blanks pressed directly from the mixture of the raw ferrite oxide particles that are oriented but slightly when pressed. We show that isotropic Mn–Zn ferrite with the desired magnetic properties at CCC can be obtained using bismuth oxide additives and a complex composition of binder during compaction instead conventionally used polyvinyl alcohol...|$|R
40|$|A {{concentrated}} {{suspension of}} <b>lamellar</b> colloidal <b>particles</b> (e. g. clay) is modelled by considering a single, uniformly charged, finite platelet confined with co- and counterions to a Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell. The system is treated within Poisson-Boltzmann theory, with appropriate boundary {{conditions on the}} surface of the WS cell, supposed to account for the confinement effect of neighbouring platelets. Expressions are obtained for the free energy, osmotic and disjoining pressures and the capacitance in terms of the local electrostatic potential and the co- and counterion density profiles. Explicit solutions of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) equation are obtained for circular and square platelets placed at the centre of a cylindrical or parallelepipedic cell. The resulting free energy is found to go through a minimum as a function of the aspect ratio of the cell, for any given volume (determined by the macroscopic concentration of platelets), platelet surface charge and salt concentration. The optimum aspect ratio is found to be nearly independent of the two latter physical parameters. The osmotic and disjoining pressures are found to coincide at the free energy minimum, while the total quadrupole moment of the electric double-layer formed by the platelet and the surrounding co- and counterions vanishes simultaneously. The osmotic equation-of-state is calculated for a variety of physical conditions. The limit of vanishing platelet concentration is considered in some detail, and the force acting between two coaxial platelets is calculated in that limit as a function of their separation.

40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} (PS) is {{an essential}} complex of lipids and specific proteins synthesized in alveolar type II pneumocytes, where it is assembled and stored intracellularly as multilayered organelles known as lamellar bodies (LBs). Once secreted upon physiological stimulation, LBs maintain a densely packed structure {{in the form of}} <b>lamellar</b> body-like <b>particles</b> (LBPs), which are efficiently transferred into the alveolar air-water interface, lowering surface tension to avoid lung collapse at end-expiration. In this work, the structural organization of membranes in LBs and LBPs freshly secreted by primary cultures of rat ATII cells has been compared with that of native lung surfactant membranes isolated from porcine bronchoalveolar lavage. PS assembles in LBs as crystalline-like highly ordered structures, with a highly packed and dehydrated state, which is maintained at supraphysiological temperatures. This relatively ordered/packed state is retained in secreted LBPs. The micro- and nanostructural examination of LBPs suggests the existence of high levels of structural complexity in comparison with the material purified from lavages, which may contain partially inactivated or spent structures. Additionally, freshly secreted surfactant LBPs exhibit superior activity when generating interfacial films and a higher intrinsic resistance to inactivating agents, such as serum proteins or meconium. We propose that LBs are assembled as an energy-activated structure competent to form very efficient interfacial films, and that the organization of lipids and proteins and the properties displayed by the films formed by LBPs are likely similar to those established at the alveolar interface and represent the actual functional structure of surfactant as it sustains respiration...|$|R
40|$|Eight lanthanide(III) oleates {{have been}} {{prepared}} and characterized. The chelation and self-assembly structures of these rare-earth oleates have been studied by elemental analysis, Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Elemental analysis and FTIR results indicate that three oleate anions are complexed with one lanthanide cation and, {{with the exception of}} anhydrous cerium(III) oleate, form either a mono- or a hemihydrate. The X-ray analysis showed that the neat lanthanide soaps have a lamellar bilayer structure at room temperature. The thermal behavior has been investigated by cross-polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). POM scans showed that all the lanthanide oleates form a lamellar phase in the presence of excess water. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and XRD were used to investigate the internal structure of the bulk lanthanide oleates in excess water, and these X-ray results conﬁrmed that the lanthanide oleates do not swell in water. Select lanthanide oleates were dispersed in water to form nonswelling <b>lamellar</b> submicrometer <b>particles,</b> conﬁrmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and synchrotron SAXS measurements. NMR results indicated that colloidal dispersions of lanthanide oleates containing paramagnetic ions, such as gadolinium(III), terbium(III), and dysprosium(III), have a signiﬁcant effect on the longitudinal (T 1) and transverse (T 2) relaxation times of protons in water. Time-resolved ﬂuorescence measurements have demonstrated that colloidal dispersions of europium(III) oleate exhibit strong luminescence. The rare earth metal soaps exemplify the potential of self-assembled chelating amphiphiles as contrast agents in medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ﬂuorescence imaging...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{established}} the efficient mucosal delivery of vaccines using absorption enhancers and chitosan. In addition, {{the use of}} chitosan was shown to enhance the action of other known adjuvants, such as CTB or Quil-A. Collectively, the results presented herein indicate that chitosan has excellent potential as a mucosal adjuvant. We have evaluated a number of absorption enhancers for their adjuvant activity in vivo. Polyornithine was shown to engender high scrum immune reasons to nasally delivered antigens, with higher molecular weight polyornithine facilitating the best results. We have demonstrated {{for the first time}} that vitamin E TPGS can act as mucosal adjuvant. Deoxycholic acid, cyclodextrins and acylcarnitines were also identified as effective mucosal adjuvants and showed enhanced immune responses to nasally delivered TT, DT and Yersinia pestis V and F 1 antigens. Previously, none of these agents, common in their action as absorption enhancing agents, have been shown to have immunopotentiating activity for mucosal immunisation. We have successfully developed novel surface modified microspheres using chitosan as an emulsion stabiliser during the preparation of PLA microspheres. It was found that immune responses could be substantially increased, effectively exploiting the immunopenetrating characteristics of both chitosan and PLA microspheres in the same delivery vehicle. In the same study, comparison of intranasal and intramuscular routes of administration showed that with these formulations, the nasal route could be as effective as intramuscular delivery, highlighting the potential of mucosal administration for these particulate delivery systems. Chitosan was co-administered with polymer microspheres. It was demonstrated that this strategy facilitates markedly enhanced immune responses in both magnitude and duration following intramuscular administration. We conclude that this combination shows potential for single dose administration of vaccines. In another study, we have shown that the addition of chitosan to alum adsorbed TT was able to enhance immune responses. PLA micro/nanospheres were prepared and characterised with discreet particle size ranges. A smaller particle size was shown to facilitate higher scrum IgG responses following nasal administration. A lower antigen loading was additionally identified as being preferential for the induction of immune responses in combination with the smaller particle size. This may be due to the fact that the number of particles will be increased when antigen loading is low, which may in turn facilitate a more widespread uptake of <b>particles.</b> PLA <b>lamellar</b> <b>particles</b> were prepared and characterised. Adsorbed TT was evaluated for the potential to engender immune responses in vivo. These formulations were shown to generate effective immune responses following intramuscular administration. Positively charged polyethylcyanoacrylate and PLA nanoparticies were designed and characterised and their potential as delivery vehicles for DNA vaccines was investigated. Successful preparation of particles with narrow size distribution and positive surface charge (imparted by the inclusion of chitosan) was achieved. In the evaluation of antibody responses to DNA encoded antigen in the presence of alum administered intranasally, discrimination between the groups was only seen following intramuscular boosting with the corresponding protein. Our study showed that DNA vaccines in the presence of either alum or Quil-A may advantageously influence priming of the immune system by a mucosal route. The potential for the combination of adjuvants, Quil-A and chitosan, to enhance antibody responses to plasmid encoded antigen co-administered with the corresponding protein antigen was shown and this is worthy of further investigation. The findings here have identified novel adjuvants and approaches to vaccine delivery. In particular, chitosan or vitamin E TPGS are shown here to have considerable promise as non-toxic, safe mucosal adjuvants. In addition, biodegradable mucoadhesive delivery systems, surface modified with chitosan in a single step process, may have application for other uses such as drug and gene delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the cermet fraction in cermet/ metal composite coatings developed by High-Velocity Oxyfuel Flame (HVOF) spraying on their tribological behaviour was studied. Five series of coatings, each one containing different proportion of cermet-metal components, prepared by premixing commercially available feedstocks of NiCrFeBSiC metallic and WC-Co/Cr cermet powders were deposited on AISI 304 stainless steel substrate. The microstructure of as-sprayed coatings was characterized by partial decomposition of the WC <b>particles,</b> <b>lamellar</b> morphology and micro-porosity among the solidified splats. Tribological behavior was studied under sliding friction conditions using a Si 3 N 4 ball as counterbody and the friction coefficient and volume loss were determined {{as a function of}} the cermet fraction. Microscopic examinations of the wear tracks and relevant cross sections identified the wear mechanisms involved. Coatings containing only the metallic phase were worn out through a combination of ploughing, micro-cracking and splat exfoliation, whilst those containing only the cermet phase primarily by micro-cracking at the individual splat scale. The wear mechanisms of the composite coatings were strongly affected by their randomly stratified structure. In-depth cracks almost perpendicular to the coating/ substrate interface occurring at the wear track boundaries resulted in cermet trans-splat fracture...|$|R
40|$|Inorganic <b>lamellar</b> solid <b>particles,</b> {{for example}} {{molybdenum}} disulphide, {{have been used}} as solid additives in lubricants to improve their friction and wear properties. Recently, inorganic fullerene-like materials (IFLM) of metal dichalcogenides with a closed-cage structure have been synthesized. It has been shown that mechanical dispersion of IFLM nanoparticles in mineral and synthetic base oils gives benefits of low friction coefficient and wear and the benefits are superior to those of lamellar solids. The IFLMs positive effect on the oils performance was attributed to rolling mechanism and to their mechanical degradation. The aim of the thesis is to extend knowledge of inorganic tungsten disulphide (IFWS 2) nanoparticles behaviour through study of their interactions with other additives in prepared oils. The investigation of the IF-WS 2 lubrication efficiency had several major objectives. These were: to evaluate effect of various sliding-rolling ratios and temperatures, to classify the IF-WS 2 {{from the point of view}} of additive groups and to evaluate the nature of interactions between specific additives and the nanoparticles. Lubrication efficiency of IF-WS 2 nanoparticles dispersed in oils was evaluated on tribo-rigs with ball-on-disc configuration at a wide range of operating conditions. For the testing of oils with IF-WS 2 Mini Traction Machine (MTM) and High-Frequency Reciprocating (HFRR) rigs were employed. Standard highly polished specimens made of AISI M 52100 steel were used. In addition, Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) rig was utilised for film thickness measurements. One of the major outcomes of this work was establishing a positive effect of elevated temperature on IF-WS 2 dispersion, friction and wear behaviour. Also, a certain sulphuric extreme pressure additive improved IF-WS 2 dispersion properties, which was attributed to a synergistic reaction between these two additives. Moreover, the tribological performance of the nanosuspension was found to be improved by addition of stearic acid under moderate conditions, where nanoparticles show no contribution. Study of interactions between ZDDP and the nanoparticles has shown superior performance of the ZDDP solution compared to the nanosuspension under given conditions. Imperial User Onl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Electrorheological fluids (ER) are {{commonly}} known as suspensions composed of semiconducting particles dispersed in insulating oil that respond to electric fields by gelling. The increase in suspension viscosity on application of the field is typically rapid and reversible and as a result, the ER response is amenable to applications where real time control of stress transfer properties is required. Ferroelectric particles are interesting in this application due to the presence of spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant. Particularly, Bismuth Titanate (Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 -BIT) is well-known as layer-structured ferroelectrics, so the typical morphology of these crystals is <b>lamellar.</b> Therefore, these <b>particles</b> dispersed in oil, in the presence of an electric field must produce an interesting ER response. Thus, BIT powders were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction method and the particles size was adjusted using ball milling process. Different ER fluids containing average particles size about 2. 5 to 0. 5 µm were dispersed in silicon oil about 10 % vol and were submitted to AC and DC electric field. The relation between the BIT particles size with the ER response was observed, presenting an increase of the shear stress with the reduction on particle size...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{synthesis}} route to carbon with hierarchical morphology on the nanoscale. The structures are generated using crystalline orthorhombic lithium carbide (Li 2 C 2) as precursor with nanolamellar organization. Careful treatment by SnI 4 oxidizes carbon at the fairly low temperature of 80 degrees C to the elemental state and keeps intact the initial crystallite shape, the internal <b>lamellar</b> texture of <b>particles,</b> and the lamellae stacking. The reaction product is amorphous but displays in the microstructure parallel band-like arrangements with diameters {{in the range}} of 200 - 500 nm. These bands exhibit internal fine structure made up by thin strips of about 60 nm width running inclined with respect to the long axis of the band. The stripes of neighboring columns sometimes meet and give rise to arrow like arrangements in the microstructure. This is an alternative preparation method of nanostructured carbon from an inorganic precursor by a chemical redox route without applying physical methods such as ion implantation, printing, or ablation. The polymerization reaction of the triple bond of acetylide anions gives rise to a network of carbon sp(2) species with statistically sized and distributed pores with diameters between 2 and 6 angstrom resembling zeolite structures. The pores show partially paracrystal-like ordering and may indicate the possible formation of carbon species derived from graphitic foams...|$|R
