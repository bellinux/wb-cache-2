5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they were in. This <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E
40|$|Miller [1977. Risk, uncertainty, and {{divergence}} <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Journal <b>of</b> Finance 32, 1151 - 1168] hypothesizes {{that prices}} of stocks subject to high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{we find that}} high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks. In addition, the returns on high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements. <b>Differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> Earnings announcements Institutional ownership Limits to arbitrage Market efficiency Short-sales constraints...|$|R

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, {{he acknowledged that}} he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, {{was an integral part}} of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{regarding}} {{political participation}} also marks the {{fundamental difference between}} the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

40|$|In price-optimism models, <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> lead {{to stock}} overvaluation, as optimistic {{investor}}s hold stocks while pessimistic investors {{stay out of}} the market due to short-sales constraints. We find that retail investor sentiment {{plays an important role in}} the relation between <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and overvaluation. Stocks are overvalued when both <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and small-trade imbalances are high, but not so when either of these two is low. In addition, mispricing happens before retail investors start to buy. Therefore, it is not retail investors who directly cause mispricing with their trades, but rather they delay the realization of negative information into stock prices and facilitate mispricing.
