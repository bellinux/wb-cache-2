500|$|With {{the loss}} of self goes Eliezer's sense of time: [...] "I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father. How he had changed!... So much had {{happened}} within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train? Was it only a week? One night–one single night?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{opponent}} out of {{the corner}} of my eyes. The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|The {{salesman}} {{nodded and}} shot a questioning <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|She shot a timid <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{face and}} looked troubled at the question, but made no reply.|$|R
60|$|I cast a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> uncle, and I {{saw that}} the shadow had deepened upon his face.|$|R
60|$|I tore myself away. At {{the hall}} door, Lady Georgina intercepted me. She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> red eyes. 'Then {{you have taken}} him?' she cried, seizing my hand.|$|E
6000|$|Something in my tone struck him: {{and when}} he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> eye and read what was written there, his face paled perceptibly. He hesitated a moment, then said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will soon}} be here," [...] she said, [...] "for I have just <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Magic Picture, and have seen them {{coughing}} and choking with the dust in the tunnel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a strange}} thing!" [...] he said. [...] "And you {{are fond of}} {{gathering}} pretty flowers?" [...] he continued, with a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> treasure.|$|R
60|$|He shot {{a mischievous}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother as he spoke, and she laid down her {{knitting}} {{on her lap}} and looked very earnestly at him.|$|R
60|$|With an admiring <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> tormentors, I {{rolled out}} my sleeping-bag and crawled into it, vowing I would remain there even if devil-fish, armed with pikes, invaded our cave.|$|R
60|$|She murmured {{in reply}} {{something}} melodious and inarticulate, then <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{face in a}} questioning way; {{but only for a}} moment, then her sweet eyes were again veiled under those drooping lashes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch, {{saw that}} I {{had already been}} out just three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided there was not time to go round, turned--" ...|$|E
60|$|As I dressed I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. It was {{no wonder}} {{that no one was}} stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly {{finished}} when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, I do; {{and again}} I tell you, I do," [...] he replied. He paused, {{suddenly}} <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face, and added, [...] "Why do you ask, Davy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl cast a bewildered <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wife, who said, [...] "You needn't pay any {{attention}} to him, Miss Gage. He has an idea that he is making a joke." ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{delivered}} this formal mandate, {{to neglect}} which meant imprisonment, or worse, {{she threw her}} cloak about her, and with a wondering <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face, {{opened the door and}} went.|$|R
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion, {{and finding}} {{that he had}} already risen {{and was ready to}} depart, thanked them for what they had told me, and took my leave. The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out, and he looked full at her.|$|E
60|$|So back we went, Oro pausing a while {{behind and}} {{overtaking}} us with long, determined strides. Yva led us, gliding {{at my side}} and, as I thought, now and again <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face with a look that was half anxious and half pitiful. Also twice she stooped and patted Tommy.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{companion}} {{a little}} curiously. There {{was something in}} his manner distinctly puzzling. With his lips he was smiling approval at the little danseuse who was pirouetting near our table, {{but it seemed to}} me that his mind was busy with other thoughts. Suddenly he turned his head toward mine.|$|E
60|$|The old man {{frowned and}} shook his head; while she, after one swift, shy <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face, and with {{something}} like a smile flitting over her delicate lips, turned and re-entered the house.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he smiled very pleasantly, and bowed two or three times, and told the steward to open the cabin-door, which the steward did with a {{peculiar}} sort of grin on his face, and a slanting <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> shooting-jacket. And so we left.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{keep her}} {{portrait}} constantly before me to correct my natural amativeness. I {{fell in love}} with her and married her. I have fallen in love once or twice since but a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lost Hetty has cured me of the slightest inclination to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{the largest}} foot," [...] and then I {{proceeded}} {{to explain to}} him my misfortune. He took up first my top-boot, and then the shooting- boot--in looking at which he gazed with wonder at the nails;--and then he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> feet, measuring them with his eye; and after this he pronounced his opinion.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} again upon the bed. I looked at the pillow and the unturned coverlet doubtfully. They had {{obviously}} not been disturbed. I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch! it was barely two o'clock. I had not even been to bed. I {{could not possibly be}} dreaming! The door was straining now almost to bursting. I began to be annoyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "A great deal," [...] I answered, [...] "seeing that a {{young woman}} and my friend are concerned. As for firing at you, had I done so {{you would not be}} asking {{questions}} now. I fired at the pistol in your hand, but if there is more trouble next time it shall be at the holder," [...] and I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> revolver.|$|E
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. She <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> entrance.|$|R
60|$|She was gone, past recall; and all {{the love}} and {{gratitude}} and remorse I had longed to express flooded up in me. Yet, stuck up there in my chair, my chief apprehension had been that Fleming might come in again, and cast yet another veiled, sneering <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> visitor.|$|R
60|$|Instinctively I drew away, lips dry, {{and heart}} numbly, heavily beating. An {{influence}} more secret than {{the shadow of}} a cloud had suddenly chilled and darkened the garden and robbed it of its beauty. I shrank into myself, cold and awkward, and did not dare even to <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion.|$|R
6000|$|That evening, {{at dinner}} in the saloon, the pea-green young man strolled in with a jaunty air and took his seat next to us. The Red Sea, by the way, was kinder than the Mediterranean: it allowed us to dine {{from the very first}} evening. Cards had been laid on the plates to mark our places. I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> neighbour's. It bore the inscription, 'Viscount Southminster.' ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{too much}} taken aback at so providential an {{interposition}} to contradict this highly imaginative statement. My highwayman {{had turned into a}} protecting knight-errant of injured innocence. I let the policeman go his way; then I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> preserver. A very ordinary modern St. George he looked, with no lance to speak of, and no steed but a bicycle. Yet his mien was reassuring.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old friends, who {{grinned at}} me through the berry-stain on their faces. We reached a ditch through which the rain {{of the night before}} was {{draining}} from the fields Clark dropped the bridle, stooped down, and rubbed his face clean. Up he got again and flung the feathers from his head, and I thought that his eyes twinkled despite the sternness of his look.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} photographer, with a {{momentary}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face, [...] "the eyebrows are removed. We have a process now--the Delphide--for putting in new ones. You'll notice here where we've applied it {{to carry the}} hair away from the brow. I don't like the hair low on the skull." ...|$|R
5000|$|Don't {{expect the}} {{narratives}} in Joy Katz's first book to resolve themselves into tidy morals. There's nothing Aesopian about Fabulae. A <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Latin dictionary {{suggests that a}} more apt translation of the title is [...] "myths," [...] for these unsettling poems conceal and reveal insights more spiritual and unpredictable than aphoristic. They resist easy expectations.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> mother <b>glanced</b> across <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father, but the man, intercepting her question, {{replied to}} it himself.|$|R
