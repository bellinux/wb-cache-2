2500|$|The {{mathematical}} {{theory of}} origami {{is more powerful}} than compass and straightedge construction. Folds satisfying the Huzita–Hatori axioms can construct exactly {{the same set of}} points as the extended constructions using a compass and conic <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> Therefore, origami can also [...] be used to solve cubic equations (and hence quartic equations), and thus solve two of the classical problems.|$|E
2500|$|A {{point has}} a solid {{construction}} {{if it can be}} constructed using a straightedge, compass, and a (possibly hypothetical) conic <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> that can draw any conic with already constructed focus, directrix, and eccentricity. [...] The same set of points can often be constructed using a smaller set of tools. [...] For example, using a compass, straightedge, and a piece of paper on which we have the parabola y=x2 together with the points (0,0) and (1,0), one can construct any complex number that {{has a solid}} construction. [...] Likewise, a tool that can draw any ellipse with already constructed foci and major axis (think two pins and a piece of string) is just as powerful.|$|E
2500|$|The neusis {{construction}} {{is more powerful}} than a conic <b>drawing</b> <b>tool,</b> as one can construct complex numbers {{that do not have}} solid constructions. [...] In fact, using this tool one can solve some quintics that are not solvable using radicals. [...] It is known that one cannot solve an irreducible polynomial of prime degree greater or equal to 7 using the neusis construction, so {{it is not possible to}} construct a regular 23-gon or 29-gon using this tool. [...] Benjamin and Snyder proved that it is possible to construct the regular 11-gon, but did not give a construction. [...] It is still open as to whether a regular 25-gon or 31-gon is constructible using this tool.|$|E

The apparel design is very specific with its various <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in CAD systems. The maximal aid {{is possible only}} after the optimum use of tools. This paper presents a classification of <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in connection with 2 D apparel design, construction and modelling. Key words: CAD, apparel design constructing, apparel design modelling PROBLEM STATEMENT CAD/CAM systems made their debut in the garment industry in the 1960 s, but design constructing and modelling are last automated stages 1 Apparel constructing and modelling are bi-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D). The present paper views the 2 D apparel design. Bi-dimensional constructing and modelling are based on traditional hand design of garments. The traditional hand methodologies are transformed for automated design in conformity with the <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification. A study of systems and publication about 2 D apparel design show different using of <b>tools</b> for <b>drawing</b> and modification. There is no concrete information about use of a fixed tool and why it is chosen. One and the same construction is drawn in CAD using of very different tools. The paper presents a classification of <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in connection with 2 D apparel design constructing and modelling. The purpose of this classification is optimum using of tools for design of garment...|$|R
