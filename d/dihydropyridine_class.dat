40|$|Different {{classes of}} calcium {{antagonist}} were defined in vitro using radioligand binding {{studies and the}} efficacy of the classes as neuroprotective agents was assessed in vivo using a novel model of cerebral ischaemia. Radioligand binding studies indicated that the interactions of both <b>class</b> I (<b>dihydropyridines)</b> and <b>class</b> II (verapamil and diltiazem) calcium antagonists was temperature-, ligand- and tissue-dependent. Specific binding sites for class III antagonists (flunarizine, fluspirilene, etc.), labelled by [3 H] fluspirilene in skeletal muscle, were not identified in brain membranes, although these compounds allosterically regulated [3 H] dihydropyridine binding in brain. All class III compounds displayed high affinity for the [3 H] fluspirilene site in skeletal muscle membranes and thus fluspirilene appeared to be prototypical of this class of compound. The calcium antagonist SR 33557 identified a novel high affinity binding site in brain membranes. This putatative fourth site for a calcium antagonist appeared to be tightly coupled to the <b>dihydropyridine</b> site. <b>Class</b> III calcium antagonists displayed a range of affinities for other receptor and ion channel sites but all class III calcium antagonists showed high affinity for rat brain sodium channels labelled by [3 H] batrachotoxinin-A- 20 -a-benzoate. In the Mongolian gerbil, forebrain ischaemia (10 min but not 5 min) with 7 days recovery produced a significant {{reduction in the number of}} [3 H] PN 200 - 110 binding sites in hippocampal membranes. However, an w 3 ligand, [3 H] PK 11195 was shown to be a better marker of ischaemic damage. Binding experiments and autoradiographic analysis demonstrated a significant ischaemia-induced increase in the density of w 3 sites after 5 min forebrain ischaemia and 7 days recovery in the gerbil. The distribution and pharmacology of w 3 sites was very species dependent. [3 H] PK 11195 was successfully used to establish a model of focal ischaemia in the mouse, in which a variety of class III calcium antagonists were found to be neuroprotective. The anticonvulsant phenytoin was active in the mouse focal ischaemia model and in an in vitro model of ischaemia (using the rat hippocampal slice). The interaction of calcium antagonists with both Na+ and Ca 2 + channels is proposed to be important as a mechanism whereby these agents confer neuroprotection...|$|R
40|$|Current {{schistosomiasis}} control {{strategies are}} {{largely based on}} chemotherapeutic agents and {{a limited number of}} drugs are available today. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the only drug currently used in schistosomiasis control programs. Unfortunately, this drug shows poor efficacy in patients during the earliest infection phases. The effects of PZQ appear to operate on the voltage-operated Ca 2 +channels, which are located on the external Schistosoma mansoni membrane. Because some Ca 2 +channels have <b>dihydropyridine</b> drug <b>class</b> (a class that includes nifedipine) sensitivity, an in vitro analysis using a calcium channel antagonist (clinically used for cardiovascular hypertension) was performed to determine the antischistosomal effects of nifedipine on schistosomula and adult worm cultures. Nifedipine demonstrated antischistosomal activity against schistosomula and significantly reduced viability at all of the concentrations used alone or in combination with PZQ. In contrast, PZQ did not show significant efficacy when used alone. Adult worms were also affected by nifedipine after a 24 h incubation and exhibited impaired motility, several lesions on the tegument and intense contractility. These data support the idea of Ca 2 +channels subunits as drug targets and favour alternative therapeutic schemes when drug resistance has been reported. In this paper, strong arguments encouraging drug research are presented, with a focus on exploring schistosomal Ca 2 +channels...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} supports the ‘calcium hypothesis’ of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which postulates that a variety of insults might disrupt the homeostatic regulation of neuronal calcium (Ca 2 +) in the brain, resulting in the progressive symptoms that typify the disease. However, despite ongoing efforts to develop new methods for testing therapeutic compounds that might be beneficial in AD, no single bioassay permits both rapid screening and in vivo validation of candidate drugs that target specific components of the Ca 2 + regulatory machinery. To address this issue, we have integrated four distinct model systems that provide complementary information about a trial compound: the human neuroblastoma MC 65 line, which provides an in vitro model of amyloid toxicity; a transgenic Drosophila model, which develops age-dependent pathologies associated with AD; the 3 ×TgAD transgenic mouse, which recapitulates many of the neuropathological features that typify AD; and the embryonic nervous system of Manduca, which provides a novel in vivo assay for the acute effects of amyloid peptides on neuronal motility. To demonstrate the value of this ‘translational suite’ of bioassays, we focused on a set of clinically approved <b>dihydropyridines</b> (DHPs), a <b>class</b> of well-defined inhibitors of L-type calcium channels that have been suggested to be neuroprotective in AD. Among the DHPs tested in this study, we found that isradipine reduced the neurotoxic consequences of β-amyloid accumulation in all four model systems without inducing deleterious side effects. Our results provide new evidence in support of the Ca 2 + hypothesis of AD, and indicate that isradipine represents a promising drug for translation into clinical trials. In addition, these studies also demonstrate that this continuum of bioassays (representing different levels of complexity) provides an effective means of evaluating other candidate compounds that target specific components of the Ca 2 + regulatory machinery and that therefore might be beneficial in the treatment of AD...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{adhesion}} force between {{the tip of}} an atomic force microscope cantilever derivatized with nimodipine (a calcium blocker, from the <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class,</b> currently used in clinical medicine for hypertension) and living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (unicellular eukaryotes which portray ultrastructural features characteristic of higher eukaryotic cells) was measured. This methodology allowed us to locate (and visualize) pores on the cell surface which {{may be responsible for}} calcium transportation in the living cells. The interaction of the cantilever derivatized with the calcium blocker and a pore, which can be a calcium channel, is more intense than a non-derivatized cantilever and the pore. Outside the pore (on the rest of cell surface), a derivatized or a non-derivatized cantilever has the same pattern of {{adhesion force}}.

40|$|Various pharmacologic {{agents have}} been used for {{perioperative}} BP control in pediatric patients, including sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, &# 946;-adrenergic antagonists, fenoldopam, and calcium channel antagonists. Of the calcium antagonists, the majority of the clinical experience remains with the dihydropyridine nicardipine. Clevidipine is a short-acting, intravenous calcium channel antagonist of the <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class.</b> It undergoes rapid metabolism by non-specific blood and tissue esterases with a half-life of less than 1 minute. As a dihydropyridine, its cellular and end-organ effects parallel those of nicardipine. The clevidipine trials in the adult population have demonstrated efficacy in rapidly controlling BP in various clinical scenarios with a favorable adverse effect profile similar to nicardipine. Data from large clinical trials regarding the safety and efficacy of clevidipine in children is lacking. This manuscript aims to review the commonly used pharmacologic agents for perioperative BP control in children, discuss the role of calcium channel antagonists such as nicardipine, and outline the preliminary data regarding clevidipine in the pediatric population...|$|E

Gastric floating drug delivery systems (GFDDS) offer numerous advantages over other gastric retention systems. In the present work, Gastric floating drug delivery systems (GFDDS) as effervescent floating tablets were developed in seven different formulation (F 1 to F 7) by using different combination of polymers with an objective of achieving 24 hours floating time. The floating tablets were developed using hydrophilic polymer HPMC (K 4 M), HPMC (K 15 M) and hydrophobic polymer Carbopol 934 P to deliver Felodipine in the upper parts of the intestine in a controlled manner to improve its bioavailability. The GFDDS were developed by direct compression method which comprises of an effervescent agent, swellable polymer and a binding agent. The formulations were evaluated for various physical properties, buoyancy studies, dissolution parameters and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Formulation F 5 showed maximum floating time of 24 hours and gave slow and sustained drug release of Felodipine. It was concluded from the various experimental data that Felodipine can be given in floating drug delivery system to achieve the desired requirement...|$|E
40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} calcium channel blockers (CCBs) enhance the anti-tumour activity of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin) against both cisplatin-sensitive human glioblastoma U 87 MG cells and cisplatin-resistant U 87 -MG-CR cells, the latter of which we developed for resistance to cisplatin. Nifedipine, a <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class</b> CCB, significantly enhanced the anti-tumour effect of cisplatin on these two cell types in vitro and in vivo. Our findings also indicated that, {{in the absence of}} normal extracellular Ca 2 + nifedipine was capable of enhancing the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In addition, this anti-tumour activity was partially inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that it is possibly dependent upon new RNA and protein synthesis. Interestingly, ultrastructural analysis, DNA fragmentation assay and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that synergism between cisplatin and nifedipine results in apoptosis (programmed cell death) at a relatively low concentration of cisplatin, which when tested alone did not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nuclei from these cells lack a Ca(2 +) -dependent endonuclease that degrade chromatin in the linker region between nucleosomes. In conclusion, our studies suggest that the non-cytotoxic agent nifedipine is able to synergistically enhance the anti-tumour effects of cisplatin on U 87 -MG and U 87 -MG-CR cells lacking a Ca(2 +) -dependent endonuclease and subsequently to induce apoptosis via interaction of nifedipine with an as yet uncharacterised functional site other than a calcium channel on target cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} acute hemodynamic and {{long-term}} clinical effects of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class,</b> {{we performed a}} double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study in 19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0. 18 +/- 0. 05. Patients were treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine increased cardiac index (+ 36 %) and stroke volume index (+ 30 %) (both P < 0. 001), while systemic vascular resistance (- 33 %) and mean arterial pressure (- 10 %) decreased (both P < 0. 005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected. Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1 death, 1 side-effects), but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO 2), LVEF, echocardiographic indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment. Repeat invasive hemodynamic measurements showed that the initial improvement by isradipine was not present anymore. In conclusion, despite a beneficial acute hemodynamic effect, isradipine has no favorable clinical influence during prolonged treatment in patients with mild to moderate CHF...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesBecause of {{the known}} CYP 3 A 4 {{inhibition}} by calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), we hypothesized {{that there might be}} a drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and dihydropyridines in patients with coronary artery disease. BackgroundClopidogrel is activated by CYP 3 A 4, which also metabolizes CCBs of the <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class.</b> MethodsResponsiveness to clopidogrel was assessed by the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay and aggregometry in 200 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. ResultsThe platelet reactivity index (PRI) (in the VASP assay, normal range 69 % to 100 %) was higher in patients receiving both clopidogrel and CCBs (61 %) as compared with patients receiving clopidogrel without CCBs (48 %). The absolute difference was 13 % (95 % confidence interval: 6 % to 20 %; p = 0. 001), and the relative difference approached 21 %. A decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel (PRI > 69 %) was seen in 40 % of patients with concomitant CCB treatment and in 20 % of patients without concomitant treatment (chi-square test, p = 0. 008). Intake of CCB remained an independent predictor of reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was 30 % higher in patients on concomitant CCB treatment compared with patients without CCBs (p = 0. 046). Moreover, intake of CCBs was associated with adverse clinical outcome. In vitro incubation with CCBs (nimodipine, verapamil, amlodipine, and diltiazem) did not alter the PRI or the adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation of patients taking clopidogrel. This finding indicates that the negative effect occurs in vivo, conceivably at the level of the CYP 3 A 4 cytochrome.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are {{the drugs}} {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of epilepsy. Many AEDs have been developed, but the ideal AED which can not only prevent but also abolish seizures by correcting the underlying pathophysiology is still not in sight. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may form such a group, as the initiation of epileptogenic activity in the neuron is connected with a phenomenon known as “intrinsic burst firing” which is activated by inward calcium current. In this study, Amlodipine, a CCB of the <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class</b> was evaluated for its anticonvulsant activity in mice. It was compared with Phenytoin sodium, one of the oldest anti epileptic drugs. Amlodipine was also combined with Indomethacin, a conventional NSAID, to look for any potentiating effect of this prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 adult Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 20 - 30 G were used for this study; 48 were divided into 8 groups, each group containing 6 mice. Group 1 - 4 MES (50 m Amp for 0. 1 secs) induced convulsion method, Group 5 - 8 evaluated by using the chemo-convulsant, picrotoxin (0. 7 mg / kg). Group 1, 5 are controls of MES, Picrotoxin (without treatment). Group 2 & 6 administered standard drug phenytoin (0. 5 mg/ 100 mg i. p), Group 3 & 7 : Amlodipine group (8 mg / kg i. p) and Group 4 & 8 : Amlodipine (8 mg/kg) and Indomethacin group (20 mg / kg). In MES method Duration of tonic hind limb extension, Clonic convulsions, Recovery period were studied. In Picrotoxin method Latent period before onset of convulsions, severity of convulsions assessed. Results: In electrically induced seizures, the 3 parameters compared are duration of tonic hind limb extension, THLE, (P 0. 05); duration of recovery phase (P< 0. 0001) and in picrotoxin-induced seizures, the 2 parameters are onset of seizures (P< 0. 05) and severity of seizures (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The combination of Amlodipine and Indomethacin showed a superior anticonvulsant effect than the use of Amlodipine alone, in both electrically-induced seizures and picrotoxin-induced seizures in mice...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypertension {{leads to}} {{vascular}} damage {{due to high}} pressure exerted on arteriolar wall and also promotes atherothrombosis in large and medium sized blood vessels. Thrombosis {{is an extension of}} haemostasis and platelets have {{a crucial role in the}} formation of atherothrombosis. Increased platelet activity is a risk factor in hypertensive patients and leads to cardio- and cerebrovascular events and target organ damage. Anti-platelet aggregatory treatment in these high risk patients have become a crucial step in their treatment. Recent data indicate that angiotensin II type 1 blockers or AT 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) like Losartan and <b>dihydropyridine</b> <b>class</b> of L-type calcium channel antagonist like Amlodipine have anti- platelet activity. These two classes of drugs are frequently administered in hypertensive either alone and in combinations. This study aims to compare the anti-platelet activity of Losartan and Amlodipine. Anti-platelet activity in addition to anti-hypertensive activity of these drugs would be beneficial in treating hypertensive who are at high risk of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis, if they are selectively prescribed these agents. Methods: This was an observational study. Sixty (n= 60) patients diagnosed with essential hypertension, attending medicine outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled in the study. Out of them thirty (n= 30) were patients who were prescribed losartan. Rest of the patients (n= 30) were ones prescribed amlodipine. It was ensured that the patients of both the groups were on respective medication for at least one month. Another thirty (n= 30) normotensive subjects acted as control. The bleeding time was evaluated for all three groups using Duke method of bleeding time estimation. Results: Data was analysed using SPSS software version 20. One way ANOVA was used to analyse the data. This was followed by post hoc Tukey's test. The mean bleeding time(in minutes) of Losartan group was 2. 583 +/- 0. 263 SD, Amlodipine group was 2. 214 +/- 0155 SD and control group was 1. 998 +/- 0. 198 SD. Statistically significant p value of < 0. 001 was observed in losartan and amlodipine groups. Conclusions: Our study shows that the mean bleeding time of Losartan group and amlodipine group were significantly higher than that of Control group. It was further observed that the mean bleeding time of losartan was higher than that of amlodipine group indicating a better antiplatelet action by losartan than amlodipine. Additional antiplatelet activity could be desirable to treat hypertensive patients with high atherothrombotic and/or thromboembolic risk.
