5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>population,</b> as well as the most common cause of hospitalization.

A recent report, showed that, in Sardinian population, the missense mutation Arg282Ser in APOA5 gene, correlates with a decrease in TG levels.

5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>population.</b> The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>population,</b> outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years.

It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>population</b> is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that circumcision {{reduces the risk of}} men acquiring HIV infection in areas of the world with high rates of HIV. Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>population</b> studies rate it cost effective.

5|$|Pilot whales can {{be found}} in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current {{population}} sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>population</b> in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{elimination}} of sulfisoxazole in eight renal transplant patients. The patients received sulfisoxazole prophylactically for urinary tract infection commencing 7 days postoperatively. The renal elimination of sulfisoxazole (unbound renal clearance) was decreased <b>in</b> <b>this</b> patient <b>population</b> and was highly correlated with creatinine clearance. The unbound metabolic clearance and apparent unbound formation clearance of N 4 -acetyl sulfisoxazole {{did not differ from}} values found in healthy volunteers. The protein binding was marginally lower <b>in</b> <b>this</b> patient <b>population</b> than <b>in</b> healthy subjects after a single dose. The reduced binding was compatible with a reduced albumin concentration. In contrast to the situation for healthy subjects, the binding of sulfisoxazole decreased upon multiple dosing. This is probably due to a relatively higher sulfisoxazole and N 4 -acetyl sulfisoxazole-to-albumin ratio <b>in</b> <b>this</b> patient <b>population</b> than <b>in</b> healthy subjects. No complications of sulfisoxazole therapy were seen, although in three subjects concentration of the N 4 -acetyl sulfisoxazole in urine exceeded its theoretical solubility on a few occasions...|$|R

50|$|In 1959 {{the school}} {{building}} was refurbished, helping to accommodate the growing Roman Catholic <b>population</b> <b>in</b> the town. <b>This</b> <b>population</b> growth is largely attributed to the industrialization of the town in the mid 20th century, with the town becoming a hub for the textiles industries, which attracted employees from Belfast and further afield, to settle <b>in</b> the town. <b>This</b> <b>population</b> growth resulted <b>in</b> the formation of St. Nicholas' High School in Carrickfergus, which opened its doors in September 1969.|$|R
