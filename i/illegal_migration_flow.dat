40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine why euroregions in Eastern Europe {{increased}} after the Enlargement of the EU. Euroregions in the EU developed because of the regional policy of the EU. However, euroregions in Eastern Europe existed outside of the EU and most of them do not have common border with the EU countries. They do not have sufficient financial assistance and experiences which manage the cross border cooperation. There are three reasons. First, Russia felt the threat from the EU 2 ̆ 7 s enlargement, then she launched euroregims in order to interrupt the EU 2 ̆ 7 s influence in the region between the EU and Russia. Second, the EU developed the ENP policy which meant the end of the enlargement. It means that the membership of Ukraine diminished and because of the reason Poland was reluctant and lauched the policy ‘Eastern Partnership’. Third, in order to prevent the <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flow</b> from east european countries, the EU needs the strict border control. Therefore the EU have to cooperate with such countries. Euroregions are the tool to control the region between Russia and the EU. Therefore the euroreigons in Eastern Europe increased after the EU 2 ̆ 7 s enlargement...|$|E
40|$|This essay, {{first of}} all, seeks to answer {{questions}} related {{to the problem of}} the traffic of migrants in Europe: are there organised criminal groups active in the continent who concern themselves with human trafficking and if so which groups? How do they organise their traffic? Which routes are most widely used in order to perform this criminal activity? These questions will be dealt with under a particular light: while answering them, the author will try to give a framework, though very general, of the role played in these scenarios by Western, Central and Eastern European states, sometimes as sending, sometimes as transit or destination countries. The analysis is also projected towards the comprehension of those which are the most common illicit conducts performed by organised criminals while trafficking migrants. Since the beginning, it seems noteworthy to highlight a particular point of view under which the phenomenon of traffic in human beings can be analysed and which can explain why in this context the attention of the author is mainly focused on well-organised criminal groups. There appears to be reason to believe that this illegal traffic, when it involves organised criminal organisations, is very dangerous especially because it links an international criminal dimension to a local one. In fact, the more the traffic is organised, the more it seems to exist in illegal circuits that, starting from the traffic of migrants, come to the exploitation of these people in the local criminal markets of the destination countries. It is to say that very often trafficked people, once arrived in their host countries, are pushed by the organised trafficking groups into deviant or criminal markets, such as those of drug pushing, prostitution, begging or theft, very often as a mechanism for repaying the cost of being smuggled. The second part of this essay sets some guidelines in order to build up a feasible and comprehensive strategy, at the European regional level, to fight the international migrant trafficking. In particular, it suggests to design some countryby-country tailor-made interventions. The devising of such instruments should not only be focused on criminal law but should start from a consideration: some Central and Eastern European countries are the main sending countries or seem to be chosen as transit places from which to gather migrants before moving on towards the West; while Western European countries, on their part, are mainly receivers of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} and statistical services of border management organizations in Central and Eastern European countries have registered and accumulated a vast {{body of knowledge}} on the demographics and mechanisms of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> over the last one-and-a-half decade. This paper attempts to tap this resource by summarising {{the results of a}} yearly survey among border guards of 17 countries. A set of quantitative indicators of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is developed, presented and interpreted, based on the answers of the border services to a series of quantitative and qualitative questions. This empirical material is used to evaluate the dynamics and pattern of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> in Central and Eastern Europe on the one hand, and to examine the development of border management strategies on the other. The impacts of legal and institutional reforms are investigated in light of the temporal and spatial variations of border apprehension statistics. The interdependence of the two processes is reviewed {{from the point of view}} of national border management authorities, perhaps the most authoritative source of information on the issue. The results of the authors’ annual survey indicate that the progressive development of migration control mechanisms at national and international levels seems to have a significant impact on irregular <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> as most indicators of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> have significantly decreased after the turn of the century.

The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> <b>flows</b> - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.|$|R

Twelve years after the treaty has come into effect questions emerge to what extent NAFTA was able to reduce the migration pressure: are trade and migration substitutes like the policy-makers had assumed or are they complements?

Concerning the migratory and refugee movements in and from the Horn of Africa Günther Schröder notes that greater efforts are needed to deal with its causes. A report by the German Caritasverband states that only a long-term strategy that differentiates between combating the causes for migration in the countries of origin and the development of an EU migration policy will be able to find solutions. Responding to the root causes of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> involves cooperation with third countries, including migrants' countries of origin and transit and might manifest itself in conflict prevention / peacekeeping and state building.

Phenomena like terrorist threats and <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> {{on the one hand}} and an anxious western population on the other seems to legitimize a considerable growth and sophistication of databases and surveillance technologies. Surveillance technologies may lead towards a more secure society for some. However they also have a profound rearranging effect on society and may be a threat for fundamental human rights. For these reasons social scientists have tried to slow down this fast-moving and self-evident evolution in the last ten years. In this volume we continue the debate by discussing the protagonists in the surveillance society: the surveillants and the surveilled. The contributions are set out on the consequences of surveillance technologies in specific settings: •for the large diversity of public and private, official and informal surveillants •for the diversity of included or excluded, rich or poor, anxious or careless people under surveillance •for the social interaction of the different actors in surveillance settings.

40|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 1970 s, the {{migration}} policies of developed European countries were {{based on the assumption that}} controlling immigration was possible. Due to various reasons discussed in this article, such policies proved unsuccessful. The result was an increase in the total number of foreigners and a change in the composition of immigrant communities, i. e. the proportion of supported family members increased. During the 1980 s there was increasing convergence in the migration policies of European immigration countries and traditional overseas emigration countries. Policies were more and more oriented towards preventing <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows,</b> on regulating refugee flows and on balancing labour migration with family migration. The turning-point in the direction of “harmonising” West European migration policies was marked by the Schengen agreement (1985) on gradual elimination of border controls between the signing parties (France, Germany and the Benelux countries). Fear in the face of a possible invasion of Eastern Europeans after the collapse of socialism in 1989 was a further strong stimulus towards the harmonisation of migration policies in the developing EU. As opposed to migration control, the integration of immigrants has remained so far the prerogative of nation-states. The text further presents an overview of migration policy reforms in individual member states of the EU and of multilateral actions. The post- 1989 migration regime in Europe has four major traits: 1) an extension of the agenda; 2) an accent on joint actions; 3) defensiveness; 4) confusion and an overload of issues. While on the one hand the EU continues to seek ways of protecting itself from undesired external migration, on the other hand the process of regional integration continues to “erase” its internal borders...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{immigration}} policies in OECD countries has turned its attention towards illegal migrants. Given that <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> are determined by immigration laws, the probability of potential detection, penalties for unauthorised migrants and their employers, and on income differences between sending and receiving countries, this paper presents {{a new approach to}} the problem of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> grounded on the economic theory of illegal behaviour. The framework considers the interaction of potential migrants, citizens, employers, and the government. After introducing the supply function of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> and its determinants, the trade-off between social costs and benefits of preventing and combating <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is demonstrated. This trade-off results in an optimal level of migration larger than zero. A complete "market model" of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is offered by presentation of a demand curve of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> based on the tolerance of the society towards clandestine foreigners. Equilibrium forces predict a non-zero level of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> The rule of law of our legal systems, according to which any illegal activity has to be reduced to zero, bears the danger of producing inefficient disequilibria. A reasonable policy of wanted and unwanted migration should address {{the question of how to}} allocate scarce resources.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the ISFEREA action, the JRC IPSC carried out an {{analysis}} of the permeability of the EU Eastern land border to a specific class of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows.</b> This analysis is based on a preliminary version of a spatial quantitative model of the "green border" permeability. This model was built {{on the assumption that the}} flow of illegal migrants is function of the geographical permeability of the border and crossing points, the efficacy to control them by the Authorities, and also function of the driving force defined by people's willingness to cross (push and pull factors). The spatial model developed by the JRC attempts to represent in deep only the first part of this equation, while the modularity of the proposed model may allows further development for a more comprehensive explanation the <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> phenomena. With the present release the model uses as input more than 20 spatial datasets ranging from satellite remotely-sensed data, land use land cover, digital terrain model, weather and environmental conditions, presence of population, infrastructures, and physical obstacles, and presence of border control points. The model is focused on the geographic permeability related to a standard adult person having illegal behavior and deciding to cross the green border by foot. The basic criteria implemented in the current release are built around three concepts: the rapidity of walking allowed by the terrain and the weather conditions (walk), the possibility to hide by the physical environment (hide), and the probability to be stopped by a border police agent (secure). The geographic permeability is conceptualized as function inverse of the friction surface calculated using fuzzy multi-criteria methodology with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer. Friction statistics are related to specific spatial contexts around the border lines (from 1 to 50 km) aggregated at the national and sub-national level between different countries. The model confirms the two major entry routes into Europe: the Ukrainian border and the Turkish section of the Greek border. The model shows also the high sensitivity of the potential corridor of Norway but the high number of border points at this boundary seems to be sufficient to protect this entry point. The report concludes that, in spite of limitations linked to data collection and availability, the permeability maps which resulted from this study show the high potential of such a model for the analysis of potential and actual <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> and related policy planning. This tool could provide an opportunity to test different “what-if” scenarios about the driving forces of illegal migratory flows at the external EU land border, to prioritize investments of Member States in border management infrastructures at EU level, and to develop policy advice for relevant internal and external EU policies. This modeling tool can help estimate the impact on permeability of concrete measures, such as changes in the number of border points or number of border guards and in their level of equipment at these particular points. The flexibility of the model also allows for the input of additional data like typology of border points, in order to improve the results. Finally, the development of a more comprehensive model would require the co-operation of and contribution from relevant authorities of the EU Member States as well as FRONTEX. JRC.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, and {{especially}} after the accession to the European Union, southern European countries were faced with an increased influx of immigration, particularly by third country citizens. The majority of <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> refers to <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> In this paper, the integration of new immigrant groups in the labour market has been analysed by using {{the theory of the}} segmented labour market. A high degree of labour market segmentation and irregularities in the analyzed countries is particularly present in the construction, agricultural and service sectors (households, hotels and catering). Illegal recruitment is an important attractive factor for illegal migrants, and encourages the development of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> Frequent implementation of control programmes solves the problem of illegal migrants only partially while, at the same time, an increasing number of new immigrants is being “attracted”. Due to special features of more recent <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> in southern European countries, it is possible to apply the “South European immigration model” by King and Ribas-Mateos, portraying these flows triangularly. In this model the mass influx of immigration is connected to a high level of irregularities in the economic sector and a weak welfare state. The uneven economic development of sending and receiving countries, as well as the perception of new immigrants (third country citizens) exclusively through the prism of homo economicus, does not inspire too much optimism that their position in the labour market and in society will significantly improve in the foreseeable future.
