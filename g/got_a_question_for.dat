5000|$|Then [...] "Beat the Crusher" [...] began. The two couples, {{now ready}} for the game, would have to answer {{multiple}} choice general knowledge <b>questions.</b> If <b>a</b> couple <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong, their car would move up a level on a moving platform {{and closer to the}} crusher. If they got the question right, the opposing couple's car would move up a level. If they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong when they were above the crusher, known as the 'Danger Zone', or the opposing team <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> right, the loser's car was dropped into the crusher and destroyed. The owners received bus fare home as a consolation prize. The winning couple would then have a choice of two new cars, either a luxury estate car or a stylish four-door saloon.|$|R
5000|$|Contestants {{competed for}} points, not dollars. A {{contestant}} won a Disney collector's pin for each point level he passed (minus any {{down to the}} previous milestone {{if he or she}} <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong). <b>A</b> prize table can be found below.|$|R
5000|$|First-time callers {{were also}} forbidden. Any caller {{disclosing}} their first-time status before asking their question was immediately [...] "blown up".

5000|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} buzzed in and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong, the question would be offered to other contestants, signaled by a buzzer sounding.

5000|$|The fight's bill {{comes from}} a remark made by Tarver to Jones at center ring after the referees' {{instructions}} before the second fight.

5000|$|One of the devs explained: [...] "I {{was working}} from home, going insane. I {{found out that}} this space was {{starting}} up...It’s been incredible. If I’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> from <b>a</b> tech perspective...I can just go and {{talk to some of}} Australia’s foremost experts...That kind of expertise is just invaluable as a developer".|$|R
50|$|Round Two: Match UpThe {{second round}} {{featured}} two columns of eight. Each {{word in the}} left-hand column could match up to a related word on the right-hand column (e.g. US states and their capitals). Each contestant had to answer two <b>questions</b> each. If <b>a</b> team member <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong the opposing team {{had a chance to}} steal and the question was passed over.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{audience}} member could answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{on his or}} her keypad {{at the same time as}} the hot seat contestant did. Contestants won points by pressing the correct button quickly; at the 1,000 and 32,000-point levels the game was paused briefly to show the top ten scores. If the hot seat contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong or decided to walk away, instead of additional fastest finger questions, the top scorer in the audience took his place, as long as there was time remaining. (Usually, only two full games were played.) The player with the highest score on the last game only won congratulations from the host, if that.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "Loser" [...] {{was used}} {{excessively}} in this show.

[...] A sound bite saying [...] "Loser!" [...] was sometimes used when <b>a</b> contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong; the word was also displayed on a screen during the bonus round if one contestant gave an invalid clue. The connotation was furthered with the Beck song Loser, which was popular at the time.|$|R
