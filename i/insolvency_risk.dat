40|$|The {{discussion}} {{surrounding the}} recent reregulation of the thrift industry suggests that (i) thrifts engaging in "risky" activities {{are more likely}} to become insolvent and that (ii) thrifts already near insolvency are likely to take on more risks resulting in increased loss. This paper considers the relationship between <b>insolvency</b> and <b>risk</b> taking in a simultaneous framework and uses 1978 - 1983 data for Illinois thrifts to investigate the relationship. The paper explores the likelihood that risk taking by thrifts increases as the probability of <b>insolvency</b> increases, that <b>risk</b> taking increases as the probability of failure (i. e., closure by the regulator) increases, and that the probability of <b>insolvency</b> increases as <b>risk</b> taking increases. Preliminary empirical results suggest that an increase in the probability of <b>insolvency</b> increases <b>risk</b> taking and that an increase in risk taking increases the likelihood of insolvency. This latter result is (statistically) significant only when one measures risk by an index of diversification. If sustained in more extensive testing, this result implies that regulatory restrictions on asset diversification are counterproductive.

Our {{results indicate that the}} managerial decision to purchase property insurance is positively related to company size and <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks.</b> By contrast, the amount of property insurance purchased is positively related to systematic risks but negatively related to <b>insolvency</b> and unsystematic <b>risks</b> and company size. We find that the amount of property insurance used by Chinese companies can also be affected by other factors (e. g., the cash flow constraints). In addition, the decision to purchase property insurance and the financial extent to which it is used varies among Chinese companies according to their geographical location. However, state ownership {{does not appear to be}} an important determinant of the purchase of property insurance by Chinese publicly listed companies.

Hence, it appears that the asset-backed securities market is like the commercial paper market, where a firm's ability to issue is directly correlated with credit quality.

Using the Japanese unique data set on fee-based revenues, we identify separate fee-based revenues, such as insurance and/or mutual fund sales. We find that banks with a higher BIS ratio, more branches, more monopolistic power in loan market, and higher loan-to-deposit ratios tend to have shifted towards an insurance fee-based business. This indicates that bank health and branch expansion can affect the fee business strategy at each bank. We also find that banks with lower mutual fund fee revenues tend to earn more insurance fee revenues, implying that a substitute relationship has developed between them after the Global Financial Crisis of 2007. We find that banks with higher insurance revenues are positively associated with return volatilities (such as ROA and/or ROE) but are not related with total risk or Z score. The results indicate that although increased fee-based activities can increase the volatility of bank earnings, they have only had a small impact on equity and/or <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks</b> at Japanese banks...|$|R

40|$|Drawing a {{framework}} from agency theory, {{we use a}} panel data design to examine the factors motivating the level of demand for reinsurance in the rapidly developing Swedish property fire insurance market during the interwar period 1919 – 39. We find that as hypothesised, reinsurance enabled Swedish fire insurers to mitigate underwriting and solvency risks and thus increased their capacity to underwrite new business in uncertain economic times. This in turn helped to increase the supply of indemnity coverage for property (buildings) fire risks in the Swedish insurance market. We also find that as expected, investment earnings are inversely related to reinsurance purchases. However, contrary to what was hypothesised, reinsurance appears to be positively related to liquidity levels, suggesting that over our period of analysis, fire insurers could have been reinsuring to ‘protect’ earnings and accumulated cash reserves therefore enabling investment opportunities to be realised. Analysis of the sub-period 1919 – 28 further supports this contention, while our results for the economic depression years after 1929 show that reinsurance helped mitigate underwriting and <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks,</b> suggesting that the reinsurance decision of fire insurance companies could be motivated by macroeconomic factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{for this study}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of securitization on banks credit-risk taking behaviour. Previous studies have found that securitization may have either a positive or negative effect on banks <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks.</b> In our paper, we use the U. S. bank holding companies data from 2002 to 2012 covering the period of financial crisis, and select those banks which have done any securitization activities during the period. Using the pooled OLS regression and panel data approach, we observe that securitization is positively related to banks credit risk-taking behaviour. We also find that the positive relationship between credit risk securitization and banks credit risk is predominantly driven by non-mortgage securitized assets, as mortgage securitized assets appear to have no significant impacts on credit risk. Additionally, the results show that banks with more profits are more likely to take risks. Our results indicate that current financial turmoil is associated with credit risk securitization, and once the current problems in credit markets are cleared up, securitization activities may recommence again which in turn may cause another financial turmoil.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{examines}} {{the question whether}} legislative reform is the ‘silver bullet’ for the problems generated {{by the failure of}} a company which is exposed to claims arising from the non-fulfilment of its environmental obligations. The limited capacity of the United Kingdom insolvency regime to facilitate the fulfilment of a debtor company's environmental obligations is often illustrated with reference to some significant judicial decisions. However, no real picture has emerged of the frequency with which these issues arise, based on which firm proposals for reform could be advanced. This paper argues that greater regard should be paid to existing mechanisms which provide a means of enabling <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks</b> to be managed or minimised, as these point towards the scope for these issues to be resolved through the environmental protection framework rather than through reliance on company and/or insolvency law. Design/methodology/approach: Research was conducted into the statutory and non-statutory regulations (such as statutory guidance), and case law principles, which underpin the treatment of the claims against an insolvent (or potentially insolvent) company resulting from its environmental activities. This included research into policies which have a bearing on this area, developed through governmental and civic consultations and studies. Findings: The paper concludes that the likelihood of a case for legislative reform being made out is weak, and the focus should accordingly shift to strengthening the effectiveness of existing law, policy and practice. Originality/value: This paper is the first (in the United Kingdom context) to challenge the perceived need for reform in this area, engaging with recent examples of such corporate failures and the impact of recent legislative and policy developments...|$|R
40|$|The typical large {{corporation}} divides {{itself into}} numerous subsidiaries but then overrides the liability barriers between them {{by having the}} subsidiaries and the parent company cross-guarantee each other 2 ̆ 7 s major debts. Previous scholarly theories of the corporate group cannot explain why. The leading theory posits that the subsidiaries {{make it easier for}} creditors to evaluate risk because they enable each creditor to lend against a discrete asset pool within the broader enterprise. But any such efficiency would be undercut by the guarantees, which transmit credit risk across subsidiary boundaries. This Article argues that the combination of subsidiaries and intragroup guarantees reflects a type of shareholder opportunism termed correlation-seeking. Because the <b>insolvency</b> <b>risks</b> of the entities in the typical corporate group are highly correlated, the intragroup guarantees provide the group 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders with a one-way bet. The guarantees lower the interest rates on the guaranteed debts, thus enriching the shareholders as long as the group stays solvent. And if the group falls insolvent, the triggering of liability on the guarantees makes no difference to the shareholders, whose equity stakes are wiped out anyway. The guarantees instead dilute the recoveries of the group 2 ̆ 7 s nonguaranteed creditors. This separation of burden and benefit induces firms to form too many subsidiaries and to overuse guarantees, thereby undermining transparency, complicating bankruptcy proceedings, and introducing other distortions. Current fraudulent transfer doctrine perversely upholds those guarantees that {{are most likely to be}} overused.
