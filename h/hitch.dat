I sued his manager.|$|E

5|$|Waters began touring {{in support}} of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a {{selection}} of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled. By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of <b>Hitch</b> Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E

The film earned $158.5million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by The Matrix Reloaded ($134.3million), and joining Spider-Man, The Matrix Reloaded and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one the only films to make $100million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200million mark (a record tied with Spider-Man 2) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300million (surpassing the record of 18 days of Shrek 2). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after Shrek 2 and Spider-Man) to reach $350 million.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Terry-Thomas {{began his}} stage career with an {{appearance}} in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London; {{the show was}} a hit and he appeared in it from September 1946 until January 1948. In 1949 he appeared in his first television programme, Technical <b>Hitch,</b> and scored a success later that year with his own television series, How Do You View?, which was noted for being the first comedy series on British television. In 1956 he was cast by the Boulting brothers in Private's Progress. The role boosted his film career, initially in Britain, and then in America. In 1958 Terry-Thomas released {{the first of two}} solo comedy records, Strictly T-T; the same year he also appeared as Bertie Wooster in a cast recording of Jeeves, with Roger Livesey playing Jeeves.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's <b>hitch</b> cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E

5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children <b>hitch</b> their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|St Nicholas Church, {{near the}} river Thames, has a 15th-century tower, {{although}} {{the remainder of the}} church was rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1882–84. Monuments in the churchyard mark the burial sites of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth and William Kent, the architect and landscape designer; the churchyard also houses a mausoleum (for Philip James de Loutherbourg) designed by John Soane, and the tomb of Josiah Wedgwood's business partner, Thomas Bentley, designed by Thomas Scheemakers. One of Oliver Cromwell's daughters, Mary Fauconberg, lived at Sutton Court and is buried in the churchyard. Enduring legend has it that the body of Oliver Cromwell was also interred with her, though as the Fauconbergs did not move to Sutton Court until 15 years after his disinterment, it is more likely he was reburied at their home at Newburgh Priory. Private Frederick <b>Hitch</b> VC, hero of Rorke's Drift, is also buried there.|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two <b>hitch</b> their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E
