40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} on the reproductive physiology of five rice genotypes (IR 54, IR 26, IR 2153 - 26 - 3 - 5 - 2, IR 15324 - 117 - 3 - 2 - 2 and BR 6), was investigated by treatment from panicle initiation with sodium concentrations of 20, 35 or 50 mol m- 3 in an lsquoartificial seawaterrsquo. In an experiment {{conducted in a}} <b>glasshouse,</b> <b>plant</b> height and dry weight were little affected by the treatments. There was, however, genotypic variation in {{the extent of the}} sodium accumulation, with IR 15324 - 117 - 3 - 2 - 2 containing the highest and IR 2153 - 26 - 3 - 5 - 2 the lowest concentrations: sodium concentrations were higher in older than younger leaves. Salinity delayed flowering, reduced the number of productive tillers, the number of fertile florest per panicle, the weight per grain and the grain yield: effects on grain yield were very much more severe than on vegetative growth. Panicle length was also reduced as was the number of primary branches in a panicle: again there was genotypic variation in the response of these characters to salinity, with the number of branches in IR 2153 - 26 - 3 - 5 - 2 being particularly sensitive. The concentration of sodium increased in the pollen, stigmas, lemmas and paleas with each increment of external salinity. The highest concentrations of sodium in pollen and stigmas was recorded in IR 54 and IR 15324 - 117 - 3 - 2 - 2. Pollen viability, whether tested with the tetrazolium salt thiazolyl blue (3 - 4, 5 -dimethylthiazolyl- 2 - 2, 5 -diphenyl monotetrazolium bromide or MTT), germination on stigmas, growth through the stylar tissue or F 1 seed set, was reduced particularly in those genotypes accumulating most sodium. At all three salt levels, a genotype which accumulated more Na in its pollen produced less-viable pollen than those with less Na in their pollen. Since the amount of Na in the pollen was highly correlated with the Na in the flag leaf, assessment of flag leaf Na should prove a useful indicator of the likely pollen viability. Stigmatic receptivity was also reduced, when estimated either from germination of viable pollen on stigmas of salt-grown plants, its growth through the stylar tissue or F 1 seed set. The reduction of seed set in crosses suggested that the overall consequences of salinity are dominated by effects on panicle development, stigmas and grain filling rather than on pollen. Analysis of the data suggests that genotypic variation exists in the extent to which salinity affects aspects of the plants reproductive physiology and development: this variation might be used in attempts to enhance the resistance of rice to salinity...|$|E

40|$|The Tasmanian montane and {{rainforest}} conifer genus, Athrotaxis, {{provides a}} system for investigating the relationship between leaf form and function and its adaptive significance. The two species differ markedly in leaf size, degree of imbricacy and stomatal distribution. Hybrid swarms {{in the field and}} glasshouse grown hybrid progeny are highly variable for these traits. In <b>glasshouse</b> grown <b>plants</b> of the true species and a diverse hybrid progeny, stomatal conductivity and density varied by about 200 % among individuals with a strong correlation between these traits. Hybrids were found to produce lower stomatal densities and less discrimination of 13 C than either species, leading to a negative relationship between stomatal density and delta 13 C. In contrast to the highly variable stomatal densities and delta 13 C in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants,</b> field plants were very conservative in both characters. Relatively low stomatal density and high water use efficiency in field plants suggests strong natural selection to optimize the trade-off between assimilation and water loss. Foliar conductance in the light for the hybrids and A. selaginoides was only 4 - 6 times as great as, and was strongly correlated with, conductance in the dark. This suggests either incomplete stomatal closure or greater cuticular conductance. In contrast, A. cupressoides appeared to be less "leaky", which may reflect adaptation to its more exposed habitat...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{measurements}} of low temperature (77 K) fluorescence at 690 nm (PS II) from north, south, east, and west facing cladode surfaces of Opuntia basilaris in Death Valley, California {{were made on}} six occasions during 1985. The absolute levels of Fo (instantaneous fluorescence) and Fm (maximum fluorescence), {{as well as the}} ratio Fv/Fm (variable fluorescence, Fm-Fo, over maximum fluorescence), were greater in the north face relative to the other faces. Diurnal decreases in Fo, Fm, and Fv/Fm were found concomitant with increases in incident photon flux area density (PFD). Fv/Fm was fairly low throughout the year, indicative of photoinhibition, but became somewhat elevated after a spring rain. In early fall the quantum yield of the south face was considerably depressed relative to that of the north face, and corresponding differences were observed in Fv/Fm. A decrease in PFD during growth of <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants</b> led to an increase in chlorophyll concentration, Fo, and Fm, but not Fv/Fm. Although there was some variability in the quantum yield of well watered glasshouse cladodes, a correlation was found between quantum yield and the light and CO 2 saturated rate of photosynthesis. When O. basilaris was water stressed under glasshouse conditions, reductions in quantum yield, Fm, and Fv/Fm were observed. Reductions in Fv/Fm always indicated a reduced quantum yield, although the converse was not necessarily so in well watered <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants.</b> The results {{of this study indicate that}} O. basilaris is likely to experience photoinhibition throughout much of its life in Death Valley...|$|R

40|$|Wheat genotypes {{prone to}} late {{maturity}} α-amylase (LMA) produced {{high levels of}} germination-type (high pI isozymes) α-amylase following exposure to cool temperature during grain development. Plants grown in the <b>glasshouse,</b> <b>plants</b> grown {{in the field and}} transplanted to the glasshouse after flowering, and tillers taken from field or <b>glasshouse</b> grown <b>plants</b> all responded in a similar manner. Plants or detached tillers can therefore be used in screening tests to identify germplasm with the LMA genotype. The cool temperature treatment was effective when applied continuously from shortly after flowering until near-ripeness, or when limited to the phase of grain development (26 – 35 days after anthesis) in LMA-prone genotypes that appears to be most sensitive to cool temperature. Based on these observations, guidelines for screening wheat germplasm are proposed and the advantages of using detached tillers discussed. The detached tiller method was successfully applied to a range of genotypes, some of which were known to be prone to LMA, and to a doubled haploid population derived from the cross Janz (low amylase) BD 159 (LMA genotype). The preliminary data from this population were consistent with control by a single gene and similar therefore to the model proposed previously for cv. Spica...|$|R

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} of {{nitrogen}} (N) uptake throughout growth {{was developed for}} lettuce cultivated in nutrient solution under varying natural light conditions. The model couples nitrogen uptake with dry matter accumulation using a two-compartment mechanistic approach, incorporating structural and non-structural pools. Maximum nitrogen uptake rates are assumed to decline with shoot dry weight, {{to allow for the}} effects of plant age. The model was parameterized using data from the literature, and calibrated for differences in light intensity using an optimization algorithm utilizing data from three experiments in different growing seasons. The calibrated model was validated against the data from two independent experiments conducted under different light conditions. Results showed that the model made good predictions of nitrogen uptake by plants from seedlings to maturity under fluctuating light levels in a <b>glasshouse.</b> <b>Plants</b> grown at a higher light intensity showed larger maximum nitrogen uptake rates, but the effect of light intensity declined towards plant maturity...|$|R
40|$|Effects of two {{watering}} {{techniques and}} three pot sizes {{on the growth}} of two soybean cultivars in a soil (vertisol) of low zinc status were studied in the <b>glasshouse.</b> <b>Plants</b> responded more to applied zinc when supplied with a constant water table (cwT) than when irrigated by the more common watering-to-weight method. The cwT technique accentuated zinc response through stimulation of growth in plants supplied with zinc, not because of intensified zinc deficiency. Nodule production was also greater in cwT-treated plants than in plants regularly watered to weight. Experimental precision was not significantly different in three experiments, despite differences between them in soil quantity per pot (1500, 750 and 375 g) and plants per pot (three, two or one).

40|$|Light {{is often}} {{reported}} to enhance plant nitrate reductase (NR) activity; {{we have identified}} {{a context in which}} light strongly suppresses NR activity. In vitro NR activity measurements of laboratory-grown seedlings showed strong suppression of nitrate-induced NR activity in cotyledon, hypocotyl, and root tissues of Ipomoea hederacea (L.) Jacquin; robust NR activity accumulated in nitrate-induced tissues in the dark, but was absent or significantly reduced in tissues exposed to light during the incubation. The suppressive mechanism appears to act at a point after nitrate perception; tissues pre-incubated with nitrate in the light were potentiated and developed NR activity more rapidly than nitrate-induced tissues not so pre-exposed. Suppression was affected by moderate to low light levels under full-spectrum light sources and by single-wavelength red, green, and blue sources. The suppression phenomenon persisted in early (first through fourth) leaves of <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants</b> grown in soil, and in artificially rejuvenated cotyledons.

However, the profile obtained from the wild-type material was diverse in comparison with both the transgenics and the null segregant, suggesting that the primary cause of the observed differences was that the transformation process selects for a subset of individuals able to undergo the transformation and selection procedures, and that their descendants have a restricted variation in metabolite profile, rather than that the presence of the transgene itself generates these differences...|$|R

An effective platform for profiling of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and their N-oxides (PANOs) was developed using ultra high pressure liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Field-collected populations of invasive Australian weeds, Echium plantagineum and E. vulgare were raised under controlled glasshouse conditions and surveyed {{for the presence}} of related PAs and PANOs in leaf tissues at various growth stages.

40|$|Nitrogen {{metabolism}} in {{the root}} {{is controlled by}} 2 fluxes: 1) nitrate intake from the external solution. 2) Transport of sugar from the leaves. Nitrate reduction to ammonium or direct ammonium uptake produce ammonia in the root cell. When the rate of sugar transport to root cells is slower than their sugar consumption for respiration, ammonia will accumulate and the root cells will die from ammonia toxicity. In nature, plants can be defined {{with regard to the}} activity of their root nitrate reductase. High N concentration inside the root and high root temperatures reduce root sugar content to the point of root death. Low N concentration at a continuous supply could help maintain plant roots alive, both in nature and in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants</b> grown in containers. I propose here, based on published works and our own studies, that plant roots die with increase in root temperature in the presence of nitrate or ammonium due to the depletion of sugar in the root cell by increased rate of root cell respiration. The rate of sugar supply to the root is species dependent. The rate of sugar respiration in the root is a function of root temperature. It is suggested here that the fraction of root nitrate reductase activity out of total nitrate reduction in the plant is responsible for the survival of plants between temperate and hot climates...|$|R

A diverse range of inbred lines and hybrids was grown in custom-made containers in a <b>glasshouse.</b> <b>Plants</b> were harvested when six leaves had fully expanded and encompassing angle of first flush of nodal roots (relative to vertical), leaf area, and root and shoot dry weight were determined for each plant. Nodal root angle ranged from 15 to 50 degrees for inbred lines and 14 to 43 degrees for hybrids and had a moderately high heritability (47 %) in inbred lines. However, significant interaction between male and female parents in hybrids indicated significant SCA. Variation in nodal root angle was independent of variation in plant size (shoot and root weight and leaf area). Variability in plant size among hybrids was associated with the female parent (p < 0. 001) and resulted in significant GCA. Screening and selection for nodal root angle should not be affected by potential differences in plant size between inbred lines and hybrids, although the significant SCA would limit predictability of root angle in hybrids based on the root angle of the parental inbred lines...|$|R

40|$|Temperature plays many {{important}} roles in the growth and development of cotton. Low temperatures after sowing increase the time to emergence and reduce seedling vigour often leading to poor establishment, poor early growth and increased risk of seedlino diseases. The tinting of crop matutity, yield and fibre quality may also be affected. Research is being conducted to improve {{our understanding of the}} impacts of temperature extremes on cotton performance. In Australian cotton production systems events where the nitnimum daily temperature falls below 11 'C are referred to as 'cold shocks'. The number of cold shocks is used by growers and advisors in assessing retardation of crops in their areas. However, this effect has not been tested explicitly. The aim of this work was to empiricalIy assess impacts of cold shock on pre flower development of cotton plants. Cotton seedlings were grown in controlled temperature <b>glasshouses.</b> <b>Plants</b> were transferred to cold chambers ranging from 5 to 22 'C during the night period for durations from 3 to 10 d.

When differences were generated it did not delay development to first square any more than 4 d, nor was the effect consistent. These differences translated into delays to first flower. However the delays are explained by the reduction in day deorees during the chilling period suggesting that there is no physiological damage to the plants.

Plants {{of the tank}} bromeliad Guzmania lingulata were investigated in a lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica and a shaded glasshouse in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Stomatal conductance to water vapor and leaf anatomy related to hydraulic conductance were measured for both groups.

Measurements of leaf hydraulic conductance using the evaporative flux method were also made for <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants.</b> Values for axial conductance and leaf hydraulic conductance were used in a model based on leaky cable theory to estimate the conductance of the radial pathway from the vein to the leaf surface and to assess the relative contributions of both axial and radial pathways.

Using the predicted axial conductance in the leaky cable model, the radial resistance across the leaf mesophyll was predicted to predominate; lower, more realistic values of axial conductance resulted in predicted radial resistances that were closer to axial resistance in their impact on total leaf resistance.

A synthetic anionic acrylic copolymer (ALCOSORB® 400) was mixed with a sandy soil at 5 different rates (0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 % PAM by weight) and subjected to 5 different irrigation regimes (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days interval between 2 irrigations). Soybean (Glycine max; CV Stephens) was grown during the period from January to March 2001 in pots containing 800 g of treated soil under glasshouse environment. Dry matter productions at 20, 40 and 60 days after planting (DAP), plant height at maturity and grain yield at harvest were determined. The results indicated that the amount of dry matter productions at 20, 40 and 60 DAP were found to be higher with increasing amounts of PAM in soil and decreasing intervals between 2 consecutive irrigations. Similar relationships were found for plant height at maturity. Soybeans grown in soils treated with 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 % PAM achieved grain productions which were about 6, 9 and 14 times greater, respectively, than that in control soil under 3 days of irrigation interval. It was also found that 0. 05 % PAM in soil with 4 days irrigation interval and 0. 1 % PAM in soil with 5 days irrigation interval enabled plants to achieve grain yields higher than that of control soil with 3 days irrigation interval. Therefore, crops in coarse textured soils treated with polymers can produce more grain or dry matter yield often under low frequent irrigations. It can also help to save water, time, money and energy which otherwise spent on high frequency irrigations. These findings also have potential beneficial implications to growing garden <b>plants,</b> pot <b>plants,</b> <b>glasshouse</b> <b>plants</b> and/or general horticulture...|$|R
