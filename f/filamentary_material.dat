5000|$|The {{explanation}} for these solar flares comes from Hyder’s two-fold observations. One, flares {{tended to have}} a parallel ribbon shape to them with one {{on either side of}} the filament channel. Two, these flares were not caused by or associated with geomagnetic storms. [...] Quiescent filaments have been believed to belong to a magnetic trough, which can disappear due to the field’s reconfiguration. When this happens, the <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> is said to be thrown into the corona, creating a typical solar flare. Hyder explains that the process for Hyder flares differs, in that sometimes the <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> instead cascades down the outer sides of the elevated magnetic trough, or ridge, to interact with the lower chromospheric material that is producing the flare. If this falling process is not symmetrical on either side, then there will be a double parallel ribbon shape form, whereas a symmetrical fall will produce only a single parallel ribbon. A sporadic or insufficient fall of <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> will cause bright knots of solar flares to be produced.|$|E

40|$|A {{filament}} eruption, {{accompanied by}} a B 9. 5 flare, coronal dimming and an EUV wave, was observed by the Solar TERrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) on 19 May 2007, beginning at about 13 : 00 UT. Here, we use observations from the SECCHI/EUVI telescopes and other solar observations to analyze the behavior and geometry of the filament {{before and during the}} eruption. At this time, STEREO A and B were separated by about 8. 5 degrees, sufficient to determine the three-dimensional structure of the filament using stereoscopy. The filament could be followed in SECCHI/EUVI 304 A stereoscopic data from about 12 hours before to about 2 hours after the eruption, allowing us to determine the 3 D trajectory of the erupting filament. From the 3 D reconstructions of the filament and the chromospheric ribbons in the early stage of the eruption, simultaneous heating of both the rising <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> and the chromosphere directly below is observed, consistent with an eruption resulting from magnetic reconnection below the filament. Comparisons of the filament during eruption in 304 A and Halpha show that when it becomes emissive in He II, it tends to disappear in Halpha, indicating that the disappearance probably results from heating or motion, not loss, of <b>filamentary</b> <b>material.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physic...|$|E

The objective of this Letter was to develop and demonstrate numerical simulation of electrospun nanofiber deposition on moving collectors. A dynamic model of nanofiber deposition onto a fast rotating drum was developed and used to simulate partial nanofiber alignment on this collector. The results were compared with the filamentary deposits in two classical stationary collection methods. Good agreement with experimental observations demonstrated predictive ability of simulations. The developed models can be used for the analysis of mechanisms of fiber deposition and alignment on substrates in various electric fields.

The termination of the Jet is abrupt; the E side is close to an [O III] optical filament which may be blocking propagation on this side. We argue that linear features have ordered magnetic fields and that the structure is determined by the synchrotron lifetime of particles diffusing perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} flux rope (MFR) {{is believed to}} be the underlying magnetic structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, it remains unclear how an MFR evolves into and forms the multi-component structure of a CME. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) MFR eruption on 2013 May 22 by tracking its morphological evolution, studying its kinematics, and quantifying its thermal property. As EUV brightenings begin, the MFR starts to rise slowly and shows helical threads winding around an axis. Meanwhile, cool <b>filamentary</b> <b>materials</b> descend spirally down to the chromosphere. These features provide direct observational evidence of intrinsically helical structure of the MFR. Through detailed kinematical analysis, we find that the MFR evolution experiences two distinct phases: a slow rise phase and an impulsive acceleration phase. We attribute the first phase to the magnetic reconnection within the quasi-separatrix-layers surrounding the MFR, and the much more energetic second phase to the fast magnetic reconnection underneath the MFR. We suggest that the transition between these two phases be caused by the torus instability. Moreover, we identify that the MFR evolves smoothly into the outer corona and appears as a coherent structure within the white light CME volume. The MFR in the outer corona was enveloped by bright fronts that originated from plasma pile-up in front of the expanding MFR. The fronts are also associated with the preceding sheath region followed the outmost MFR-driven shock. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, and 1 table, accepted by ApJ; any comments are welcome...|$|R

Flux cancellation and nearby flux emergence are shown to {{have played a role in}} increasing the height of the filament prior to eruption. The two viewpoints allow the quantitative estimation of a large mass-unloading, the subsequent radial expansion, and the eruption of the filament to be investigated.

HI observations of the Milky Way and other nearby spirals have revealed the presence of such gas {{in the form of}} clouds and other extended structures, which indicates on-going accretion. We use a high-resolution simulation (136 - 272 pc throughout) to study the distribution of cold gas in the halo, compare it with observations, and examine its origin. The amount (10 ^ 8 Msun in HI), covering fraction, and spatial distribution of the cold halo gas around the simulated galaxy at z= 0 are consistent with existing observations. At z= 0 the HI mass accretion rate onto the disk is 0. 2 Msun/yr. We track the histories of the 20 satellites that are detected in HI in the redshift interval 0. 5 >z> 0 and find that most of them are losing gas, with a median mass loss rate per satellite of 3. 1 x 10 ^{- 3 } Msun/yr. This stripped gas is a significant component of the HI gas seen in the simulation. In addition, we see <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> coming into the halo from the IGM at all redshifts.

40|$|Supermassive {{black holes}} (BH) are {{powerful}} {{sources of energy}} that are already in place at very early epochs of the Universe (by z= 6).

We find that SN feedback has a marginal influence on the stellar structure, and no influence on the mass distribution on large scales. In contrast, AGN feedback alone is able to significantly alter the stellar-bulge mass content by quenching star formation when the BH is self-regulating, and by depleting the cold gas reservoir in the centre of the galaxy. The growth of the BH proceeds first by a rapid Eddington-limited period fed by direct cold filamentary infall. When the energy delivered by the AGN is sufficiently large to unbind the cold gas of the bulge, the accretion of gas onto the BH is maintained both by smooth gas inflow and clump migration through the galactic disc triggered by merger-induced torques. The feedback from the AGN has also a severe consequence on the baryon mass content within the halo, producing large-scale hot superwinds, able to blow away some of the cold <b>filamentary</b> <b>material</b> from the centre and reduce the baryon fraction by more than 30 per cent within the halo's virial radius.

During the 1970 s much lower cost carbon filaments became a reality and gradually designers turned from boron to carbon composites. Despite progress in this field, filamentary composites still have significant unfulfilled potential for increasing aircraft productivity; the rendering of advanced organic composite materials into production aircraft structures was disappointingly slow. Why this is and research and technology development actions that will assist in accelerating the application of advanced organic composites to production aircraft is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{aspects of}} using <b>filamentary</b> {{composite}} <b>materials</b> as primary airframe structures on advanced atmospheric entry spacecraft {{such as the}} space shuttle vehicle were investigated to identify and evaluate potential design approaches for maintaining composite structures within allowable temperature limits at thermal protection system (TPS) attachments and/or penetrations. The investigation included: (1) definition of thermophysical data for composite material structures; (2) parametric characterization and identification {{of the influence of}} the aerodynamic heating and attachment design parameters on composite material temperatures; (3) conceptual design, evaluation, and detailed thermal analyses of temperature limiting design concepts; and (4) the development of experimental data for assessment of the thermal design methodologies and data used for evaluation of the temperature-limiting design concepts. Temperature suppression attachment concepts were examined for relative merit. The simple isolator was identified as the most weight-effective concept and was selected for detail design, thermal analysis, and testing. Tests were performed on TPS standoff attachments to boron/aluminum, boron/polyimide and graphite/epoxy composite structures...|$|R
