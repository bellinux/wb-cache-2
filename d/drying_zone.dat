40|$|Industrial tray air-dryers are {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} drying of agricultural products. The main drawback of these dryers is the non-uniform velocity distribution in the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> resulting in a non-uniform drying of the product. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was implemented to predict and decrease the non-uniform velocity distribution of various dryer configurations. Tunnel dryers in commercial use were used to obtain experimental data. The CFD results were correlated with the test data. Trolley and tray tunnel dryers provide a relatively simple, low capital intensive and versatile method for drying {{a wide range of}} products. Artificial drying has the advantage of controlled drying conditions compared to traditional sun drying. The main focus of every tunnel design should be the improvement {{of the quality of the}} product in terms of colour, texture and aroma. Increasing the evaporation rate without increasing the energy required to do so, should always be done in-line with this main objective. Many studies focus on the mango structure and food dehydration principles that influence the uniform drying product with the assumption that the airflow over the produce is uniform. Few have been conducted on the air movement inside industrial dryers. CFD analysis predicts the airflow without influencing the airflow pattern compared to the measuring equipment inside test dryers. The experimental data were obtained from an empty dryer without a flow diverter. This was compared to dryer with the flow diverter included and compared to a dryer with the trolleys, trays and mango slices included. The test results showed that turbulence created by this configuration, still played a major role in the nonuniform velocity distribution along the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> of the tunnel. The inclusion of a flow diverter did however dampen the swirl effect of the main fan. Measuring the velocity distribution was practically difficult with the handheld devices used, which influenced the accuracy of the measurements taken. This justified the CFD analysis in order to better visualise and predict the airflow pattern inside the dryer. The total average speed CFD results of the sections in the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> (without mangoes and trolleys) of the dryer without a flow diverter was 11. 2 % higher compared to the test results. It was 14 % higher for the dryer with the flow diverter included. The dryer with the mangoes, trays, trolleys and flow diverter showed a large difference where the total average speed of the CFD analysis was 49 % higher compared to the test results. The main reason for the difference of the CFD analysis compared to the measured results are the factors that influenced the uncertainty of the experimental set up. The CFD analysis showed that the coefficient of variance (CV) of the dryer with the flow diverter (mangoes and trolleys included) was 3 % lower compared to the dryer without one. Various dryer configurations were analysed using the CFD software to investigate what the best combination of flow diverter, vanes and blanking-off plates would be. A dryer configuration where flow diverters (Up-and-downstream of the main fan) above the false ceiling and inside the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> was analysed. A 16 % decrease in terms of the CV value was obtained compared to the dryer with just the flow diverter downstream of main fan above the false ceiling. There was however a large region of swirl upstream of the main above the false ceiling resulting in a larger loss of heated air through the outlet fan before it reached the <b>drying</b> <b>zone.</b> The cost of manufacturing a simple vane and flow diverter for an existing dryer is 4 % of the initial building costs (excluding the initial cost of the trolleys). The overall drying uniformity of this dryer is improved according to the CFD analysis by 7 %. A cost analysis (taking into account the 15 year life cycle of a dryer) in terms of the energy requirement to evaporate water from the <b>drying</b> <b>zone,</b> showed that the dryer with the flow diverter was 6 % less expensive to run on a yearly basis. Labour costs will be lower due to man-hours saved in terms of sorting out the wet slices from the dried product. Resources (dryers and trolleys) that would have been used for re-drying the wet produce, could now be implemented to increase the production rate of the plant.

The aim with this thesis is to make a model of temperature and velocity distribution in the up– draught <b>drying</b> <b>zone,</b> without any regard to moisture content in green balls. The velocity distribution is described by laws of fluid dynamics in porous media. The dominating heat transfer mechanism is convection due to the hot air passing through the pellet charge. The air temperature is calculated from the energy equation and the average temperature of the pellet charge is calculated from a diffusive transport equation. Simulations of velocity and temperature distribution are made with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics and the software CFX 10. 0 is used. Result from simulations show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. Experiments are performed at the Metallurgical Research Institute AB (MEFOS). The goal is to use experimental results to define unknown material parameters and to validate the simulation model. Two sets of experiments are carried out within the frames of this thesis. The first set has the aim to secure the equipment from possible measurement errors. In the second set of experiments, flow through pellets of different sizes and packing are investigated and compared with available equations. Conclusions are that it is possible to make a heat transfer model in CFX 10. 0 which calculates solid and fluid temperature. The experimental equipment at MEFOS is reliable for experiments made on small grains if results are to be implemented in the simulation model. Further investigations are required regarding on how to analyse measurements for particles in the size range of pellets and gas flows of higher magnitude when the Reynolds number becomes significant.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a project which aim is to develop a process {{integration}} model for the Swedish iron ore company LKAB's production system in Malmberget. Within the facility, there are two pelletising plants which were started up 1973 and 2006, respectively. Both pelletising plants are using the straight grate induration furnace, and they are the most energy intense process units within the facility. Basically a straight grate induration furnace consists of three different zones, i. e. a <b>drying</b> <b>zone,</b> a firing zone and a cooling zone, and their purpose is to upgrade crude iron ore to the final product of iron ore pellet. As an initial step of the project, the mass and energy flows within a straight grate induration furnace have been analysed.

40|$|Iron ore pellets are {{a highly}} refined product and for {{companies}} such as LKAB {{it is important to}} constantly improve the pelletization in order to enhance production and improve product quality. A long term goal has been established to develop and considerably refine tools and techniques with which the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> of a pelletizing plant can be optimized. The aim with this research project is to numerically investigate how material and processing parameters influence the drying. This will be applied to several scales: i) The constituents of the pellets and their properties and geometry. ii) The geometry of the pellet, their permeability and size distribution. iii) The geometry of the bed and the processing conditions including the state of the air (ex. humidity, temperature and velocity). To start with, a pellet bed model of velocity and temperature distribution in the up-draught <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> without regard to moisture transport is developed with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Results from simulations show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. Following this work, heat and mass transport within a single pellet during drying is modeled. Heat transfer and convective transport of water and air through the capillaries of the porous media is computed and vaporization by boiling is taken into account. A sensitivity analysis shows {{that it is important to}} use a realistic value of the convective heat transfer coefficient when the vaporization of water is a dominating drying mechanism while the temperature of the solid and capillary movement of water is not influenced to the same extent. The derived model is applicable to a number of numerical set up such as a single pellet placed in infinite space. To further develop a single pellet model, forced convective heating of a porous media with surrounding flow field taken into account must first be examined. Therefore, a two dimensional model with properties similar to that of an iron ore pellet is numerically investigated. With interface heat transfer condition provided by CFD, the heat transfer and fluid flow around and within a porous cylinder is examined. The results lay foundation of future development of a single pellet drying model where heat and mass transfer models are combined and coupled to the surrounding flow field.

40|$|The {{usage of}} biofuel {{as well as}} wood fuel has {{increased}} in Sweden and all of Europe during recent decades, {{and there are several}} reasons to believe that this increase will continue. An important reason for this increase is that the environmental and climate problems caused by fossil fuels are becoming even more evident. By replacing fossil fuel with biofuel, the problem of emissions from, among others carbon dioxide and sulphur compounds can be alleviated. However, substitution requires in many cases high quality processed biofuel. An early stage in the processing of biofuel is drying. Previous work treats the possibility of drying wood fuel in an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. This thesis studies the bed drying technique, conducted both experimentally and through modeling of the drying process. The experimental work is based on continuous temperature measurements in the fuel bed and provides characteristics of the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> that develops in the bed during drying. The character of the <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> is affected by both the qualities of the fuel and the operating parameters, and is decisive regarding the possibility of making the drying more efficient, i. e. optimize the usage of energy and produce a fuel with low and homogeneous moisture content. A mathematical simulation model has been developed to increase the understanding of bed drying. The model is based on fundamental physical principles and is made up of five differential equations that describe vapor flow, air flow, the fuel’s moisture content, and the bed’s pressure and temperature. The modeling work complements the experimental work and a simulation of the temperature distribution, pressure and the drying zone’s dispersion is in agreement with the experimental result. The drying of wood can signify an environmental and human health risk, since volatile organic compounds (VOC) are emitted during drying. The thesis studies these emissions with regards to type and quantity. The measurements show {{that the majority of the}} emitted compounds from Norway spruce and Scots pine are volatile monoterpenes, but also that other compounds are emitted, especially higher terpenes. Further, major differences between how the compounds are emitted and the quantities of the emitted compounds from heartwood and sapwood are shown. There are also large differences between types of wood, i. e. spruce and pine. It can be stated that both emission rate and total amount of emitted compounds increase with an increase in temperature. To reduce VOC emissions, the drying temperature should be maintained low. To develop an efficient bed drying process for wood biofuels, additional parameters must be analyzed further and weighed against each other. Based on the experimental method and the simulation model presented here, the drying can be optimized towards a more efficient use of thermal energy and a low and even moisture content in the dried biofuel...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} straight-grate pellet {{induration}} processes {{have been developed}} and carefully validated {{by a number of}} workers over the past two decades. However, the subsequent exploitation of these models in process optimization is less clear, but obviously requires a sound understanding of how the key factors control the operation. In this article, we show how a thermokinetic model of pellet induration, validated against operating data from one of the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOCC) lines in Canada, can be exploited in process optimization from the perspective of fuel efficiency, production rate, and product quality. Most existing processes are restricted in the options available for process optimization. Here, we review the role of each of the drying (D), preheating (PH), firing (F), after-firing (AF), and cooling (C) phases of the induration process. We then use the induration process model to evaluate whether the first <b>drying</b> <b>zone</b> is best to use on the up- or down-draft gas-flow stream, and we optimize the on-gas temperature profile in the hood of the PH, F, and AF zones, to reduce the burner fuel by at least 10 pct over the long term.

The analysis suggests {{it should be possible to}} reduce the burner fuel lead by 35 pct, easily increase production by 5 + pct, and improve pellet quality...|$|E
