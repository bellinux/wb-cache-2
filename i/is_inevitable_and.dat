5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>and</b> everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors {{are more likely to have}} catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E

He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that among angiosperms, {{entomophily}} is the primitive state; this is indicated by the vestigial nectaries in the wind-pollinated Urtica and other plants, {{and the presence of}} fragrances in some of these plants. Of the angiosperms, grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants are in general wind pollinated. Other flowering plants are mostly biotic, the pollen being carried by animal vectors. However a number of plants in multiple families have secondarily adopted wind pollination in contrast to other members of their groups. Some plants are intermediate between the two pollination methods. common heather is regularly pollinated by insects, but produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination <b>is</b> <b>inevitable,</b> <b>and</b> the hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.|$|E

In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me.

His preaching on Sunday afternoons {{caught the attention of}} William Temple, Lang's future successor at both York and Canterbury, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford. Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London's sermons, listening to Lang brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: [...] "I can remember all his points, just because their connexion <b>is</b> <b>inevitable....</b> <b>And</b> for me, {{there is no doubt that}} this is the more edifying by far."

500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{identified}} as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>and</b> necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it {{is the heart of the}} army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that Starship Troopers [...] "glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation – but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored." [...] The story is based on the social Darwinist idea of society as a struggle for survival based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|Minimal {{regurgitation}} – This {{means that}} the amount of blood lost upstream as the valve closes is small. [...] For example, closure regurgitation through the mitral valve would result in some blood loss from the left ventricle to the left atrium as the mitral valve closes. Some degree of valvular regurgitation <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>and</b> natural, up to around 5ml per beat. However, several heart valve pathologies (e.g. rheumatic endocarditis) may lead to clinically significant valvular regurgitation. A desirable characteristic of heart valve prostheses is that regurgitation is minimal over the full range of physiological heart function (i.e. complete functional envelope of cardiac output vs. heart rate).|$|E

This should compel all of us — world leaders, businesses and individuals — towards action rather than the paralysis of fear. We need both to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases and to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Those who would claim otherwise can no longer use science as a basis for their argument." ...|$|E

2500|$|Imagining {{what might}} ensue with unification, some {{critics of the}} one-state model believe that rather than ending the Arab–Israeli conflict, it would result in {{large-scale}} ethnic violence and possibly civil war, pointing to violence during the British Mandate, such as in 1920, 1921, 1929, and 1936–39 as examples. In this view, violence between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>and</b> can only be forestalled by partition. These critics also cite the 1937 Peel Commission, which recommended partition as {{the only means of}} ending the ongoing conflict. Critics also cite bi-national arrangements in Yugoslavia, Lebanon, and Pakistan, which failed and resulted in further internal conflicts. Similar criticisms appear in The Case for Peace. Writing in Haaretz, Nehemia Shtrasler cited numerous examples of artificially-united multiethnic states or states with significant and politically-active minorities that have seen significant internal strife, including insurgencies and civil wars, including developed countries that have seen secessionist movements, and claimed that this was because of human nature: ...|$|E
