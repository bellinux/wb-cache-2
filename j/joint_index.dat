40|$|In {{the context}} of earth observation, {{different}} sensors {{have been used to}} acquire satellite images and it becomes a research topic about how to analyse and use multi-sensor images. In this paper, we carry out a study of multi-sensor satellite image indexing. The goal is to study which kind of satellite image provides more information for classification. To this end, we prepared four datasets covering four typical cities. Each dataset consists of three kinds of images: multispectral and panchromatic images from WoldView- 2, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from TerraSAR-X satellite. Image indexing is performed at patch level with the same feature extraction method. The indexing is carried out using an active learning system we developed before. A series of independent and <b>joint</b> <b>indexing</b> by combining the features have been performed. Through this study, we found that the indexing accuracy on SAR images is the worst. By contrast, the <b>joint</b> <b>indexing</b> by concatenating the features computed from each kind of image could provide best accuracy. Thus, we conclude that combing information from multi-sensor images could achieve better results than using each kind of image independently...|$|R

30|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>index</b> vector, a novel joint {{assessment}} measure, {{consists of the}} proportion of affected joints in {{the upper and lower}} limbs, along with large- or small-joint dominance. The <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector shows big data visually and enables us to identify patients with high disease activity and poor physical function. A transformation matrix derived from the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector can predict the next-year status of individual patients, which will help them receive precision medicine. Since forecasting joint involvement is not perfect now, further investigations are needed to improve predictive accuracy by combining other predictive factors with the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector.|$|E
30|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>index</b> vector {{has other}} {{advantages}} besides predicting high disease activity and poor function among {{patients in the}} LAR group. The fact that the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector is easily understood is an advantage in dealing with big data. It aids visual comprehension as the graphical depiction of its results clearly shows the patients in the LAR group located in {{the upper part of}} the diagram (Fig.  1 b). The predicted LAR group using target patients who use MTX and bDMARDs is distributed closer to {{the upper part of the}} diagram, as is the real LAR group (Fig.  5). Moreover, this prediction method can be used for patients treated with IL- 6 inhibitor, which strongly suppresses C-reactive protein, as well as for patients taking other DMARDs, since <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector is derived from pure joint assessment without laboratory data. Furthermore, <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector permits physicians to estimate disease activity and functional damage even if a patient’s assessment or laboratory data are missing, as |Vxy| and z are correlates with SDAI and HAQ-DI, respectively; <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector encourages utilization of missing data effectively.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} a therapy combining disease with syndrome on rheumatoid arthritis. MethodsEighty patients with rheumatoid arthritis belonging to syndrome of damp-heat obstruction were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group according to stratified blocked randomization method. Forty cases {{in the control group}} orally took Loxoprofen Sodium Tablet and Leifumite Tablet and the other 40 cases in the treatment group orally took a Chinese medicine for 12 weeks as a course of treatment. ACR therapeutic effect was used as the standard for evaluating the total therapeutic effect. ResultsAfter 12 weeks of treatment, there was a statistical difference (P < 0. 01) in the improvement of VAS score, morning stiffness time, number of swelling <b>joints,</b> <b>index</b> of swelling <b>joints,</b> number of <b>joints</b> with tenderness, <b>index</b> of <b>joints</b> with tenderness, average grip strength of both hands, DSA 28 score, HAQ, patient's assessment, physician's assessment, ESR, CRP and RF in both groups. The improvement of morning stiffness time, number of swelling <b>joints,</b> <b>index</b> of swelling <b>joints,</b> grip strength, HAQ and patient's assessment in the treatment group was much better than that in the control groups with statistical difference (P < 0. 05). ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 was 27. 5 % (11 / 40), 37. 5 % (15 / 40) and 22. 5 % (9 / 40) respectively in the treatment group and 40 % (16 / 40), 27. 5 % (11 / 42) and 10. 0 % (4 / 40) respectively in the control group with statistical difference (P < 0. 05) in the superiority of the treatment group over the control group.

30|$|One {{limitation}} of this study is the relatively low diversity of patients’ demographic features and therapeutic agents. Data were collected from patients at 51 participating institutes. Almost all of the institutes are teaching hospitals for rheumatology approved by the Japan College of Rheumatology, and the patients are treated under a tightly controlled (treat to target) strategy in general. Another limitation was the assessment manner was left to each physician; therefore, there may be differences in joint assessment among physicians, which affects predictive accuracy. Despite these limitations, this study indicates that a transformation matrix derived from <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vectors can be used to predict the next-year status in each patient from multicenter non-interventional data. As computing can reduce the time required to calculate the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector, the burden of applying the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector in daily practice is low.|$|E
30|$|A {{weighted}} articular index requires complex calculations, but computing {{can reduce}} this burden. We proposed a novel <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> {{that consists of}} the sum of tender and swollen joint counts in a particular joint category (upper/large, upper/small, lower/large, and lower/small) divided {{by the number of}} evaluable joints in that category [3]. Then we found that each joint category affected activity-related and damage-related physical function (HAQ) differently: large joint involvement was associated with an increase in both activity-related and damage-related HAQ, whereas upper/small joint involvement was the most significant predictor of activity-related HAQ [4]. <b>Joint</b> <b>index</b> vector V (x, y, z) consists of the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> of the upper limbs (x), that of the lower limbs (y), and large- or small-joint dominance (z). A strong correlation was found between |Vxy| and SDAI, and z increased linearly as functional damage progressed. You can easily understand a patient’s condition graphically separating activity and damage components. The 28 simple inflamed joint count method, which ignores joint size and its distributions, does not have this merit of the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector. The mean value of |Vxy| in patients with low disease activity (SDAI[*]≤[*] 11) was around 0.1, and 5 % of upper or lower limit of z value (−[*] 4 to 4) is ±[*] 0.2; therefore, we temporarily used |Vxy|[*]=[*] 0.1 and |z|[*]=[*] 0.2 as cut-off points. Then patients in the LAR group with (|Vxy|[*]>[*] 0.1 and z[*]>[*] 0.2) had relatively high disease activity and poor physical function. Since this is the first attempt in the world to forecast joint involvement using the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector, we do not have any established cut-off scores. We believe further prospective studies using big data will optimize and validate our data.|$|E
30|$|The <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector {{incorporates}} {{both the}} upper- and lower-joint index and the large- or small-joint dominance status in each patient. Based on this calculation, patients with high disease activity and poor functional state were predicted with high probability.|$|E
40|$|Ingestion of {{fish oil}} fatty acids (omega - 3 fatty acids) {{inhibits}} {{the formation of}} arachidonic acid - derived cytokines and leads to production of compounds with diminished biological activity.

30|$|RA is not {{a simple}} {{monogenic}} disease, but a polygenic disease whereby environmental and multiple genetic loci increase the individuals risk of developing disease. Successful application of common polygenic modeling approaches would require sample sizes greater than 1000 individuals for traits with less than 50 % heritability [1]. The <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector enables us to handle 10, 000 or more data and to discriminate patients with high disease activity and poor physical function from others. Pharmacogenetic and genomic studies have the potential to enable precision medicine by providing biomarkers to target the right drug to the right patients; however, a large number of studies results to date have been disappointing and have not yielded a change in clinical practice [1]. One of the reasons is a difficulty to capture response in RA. Many research studies use composite measures such as DAS 28, which include subjective measures of disease and are known to have a placebo effect [1]. Researchers are searching a more personalized approach toward treatment to achieve rapid remission in every patient to prevent disability in a cost-effective manner [2], and our method is likely to meet the requirements. The predictive accuracy using the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector and its transformation matrix was greatest among target patients who used both MTX and bDMARDs. An appropriate transformation matrix may enable us to predict which agent will have an optimal effect on each patient before administering any drug. In combination with biological markers such as rheumatoid factors and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, this method using the <b>joint</b> <b>index</b> vector may increase the accuracy with which we can predict which patients will have poor prognosis and can contribute to precision medicine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{combination}} of model-based and iterative learning control (ILC) is proposed {{as a method}} to achieve high-quality mo-tion control of direct-drive robots in repetitive motion tasks. We in-clude both model-based and learning components in the total con-trol law, as their individual properties influence the performance of motion control. The model-based part of the controller compen-sates much of the nonlinear and coupled robot dynamics. A new procedure for estimating {{the parameters of the}} rigid body model, implemented {{in this part of the}} controller, is used. This procedure is based on a batch-adaptive control algorithm that estimates the model parameters online. Information about the dynamics not cov-ered by the rigid body model, due to flexibilities, is acquired exper-imentally, by identification. The models of the flexibilities are used in the design of the iterative learning controllers for the individual joints.

Our approach uses volume images generated by computed tomography {{and allows the}} in vivo and noninvasive study of articulations. In our method, bones are modeled both implicitly (scalar distance fields) and parametrically (manifold surfaces). Using this double representation, we compute interbone distances and estimate joint contact areas.

We demonstrate the method by applying our contact area and ligament model to the distal radioulnar joints of a volunteer diagnosed with malunited distal radius fracture in one forearm. Our approach highlights focal changes in the articulation at the distal radioulnar joint (location and area of bone contact) and potential soft-tissue constraints (increased “length ” of the distal ligaments and ligament-bone impingement in the injured forearm).
