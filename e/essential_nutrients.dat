50|$|Many living things, {{including}} humans, are auxotrophic {{for large}} classes of compounds required {{for growth and}} must obtain these compounds through diet (see vitamin, <b>essential</b> <b>nutrient,</b> <b>essential</b> amino acid, essential fatty acid).|$|R
5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients</b> for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients</b> (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or {{relatively}} harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to breastfeeding in {{the health}} practices of infants and young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients</b> present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{examining}} the health impact of sugars are inconclusive. The United Nations meta-analysis and WHO studies showed contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Other studies indicated variable results between health effects, particularly on obesity, {{and whether the}} research {{was funded by the}} sugar industry or those by independent sponsors. The 'empty calories' argument is that a diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of foods that contain <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} {{requires a}} number of <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients</b> to be present to enable it to thrive; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs; phosphorus aids growth, the setting of fruit and crop yield; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table).

5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients</b> the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and <b>essential</b> <b>nutrients,</b> awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
